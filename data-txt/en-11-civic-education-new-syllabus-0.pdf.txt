Law and Justice

Defining law

Law can be defined as a system of rules used for controlling formal human 
behaviour and human activities in a community or in a country. Different thinkers 
have defined law in different ways.

Definitions given by  T. H. Green and John Austin are given below.

'Law is a system of rights and obligations enforced by the state' . T.H. Green

'The law is the command of the sovereign and violating it is a punishable 
offence'. John Austin

Every society should be ruled according to a specific law. It is the responsibility 
of the citizens of a country to respect and obey the law. Justice, peace and social 
security are secured in a society where the rule of law exists. The prime aim of the 
law is to control human behaviour by which justice is ensured so that life, rights and 
property of the people are safeguarded.

Justice  is  another  concept  related  to  law.  Justice  can  be  defined  as  a  fair 
behaviour or fair treatment. Justice is meted out through impartial enforcement of 
law after listening to all the parties well.

Dispensing the law should be done in fairness and equality to all. If the law is 
properly exercised  in a country the society becomes law abiding. People develop a 
positive attitude towards the law and trust it. It contributes to create a just  and  fair 
society. 

Following factors are very important to create justice.

 ² Right of an individual to know about allegations made against him

 ² Right of an individual to be heard,  in person or by an Attorney-at-Law, at a 

fair trial by a competent court. 

 ² The right to get a fair and an impartial trial

Characteristics of law

All are equal before law and all have the right to get the protection of law. 
Some of the highly civilized societies, where advanced legal systems prevail, have 
the following characteristics. 

 ² Laws are made only by the state  based on its authoritative power 

 ² They are made with the intention of controlling human behaviour and 

actions

 ² Laws should be fair and just

 ² Laws  should be enacted aiming at achieving the wellbeing of the common 

society

 ² Laws should  adjust in conformity with the  changing needs of the society

 ² Laws should be clear and definite

 ² Contravention  of law is a punishable offence

Sources of law

Factors  that  contribute  to    the  derivation    of  law  or  the  means  of  getting 
information about law can be defined as sources of law. Some of these sources are 
as follows:

1. Constitution 

- 

It is the supreme law of a country

2. Different  statutes - 

They are enactments passed by the parliament and    
they can also be taken as the sources of law

3. Judgements 

- 

Decrees, orders, pronouncements or judgements  
delivered by competent Courts of Law which are  
followed by the other courts of law subsequently.  
This is known as Case law.

4. Views  and principles expressed by legal authorities or eminent scholars of   
     law are recognized as scientific principles of law.

5. Customs               -          Well established customs accepted by the society                   

                                    are known as Customary laws

6. Religion               -           Laws have been made on the basis of different  

religions. E.g. Muslim law and Vehera and Devalagam   

 law.

Types of laws

According to the way that laws are exercised, they are classified as domestic 

and international law.

Domestic laws

Domestic laws are operative and effective within the territory of a country. 
They  can  differ  from  country  to  country.  They  are  enacted  in  order  to  meet  the 
needs of the country. Domestic laws  can be classified into two types as Civil law 
and Criminal law. They are described in the diagram given below.

Differences between criminal law and civil law are as follows:

Criminal Law

Civil Law

 ² Civil  law  resolves  or  deals  with 

disputes among individuals.

 ² Civil law has different branches. 
E.g. - Law of contract business 
law,    family law

 ² Paying  compensation 

the 
affected parties on civil offences 
committed on them. 

to 

 ² Civil procedure code is important 

with regard to civil law.

 ² Civil law gives priority to recover 
damage or restoration of damage 
from the parties at fault.

 ² In  a  civil  case  application  for 
relief  from  court  is  sought  by 
individual parties concerned.

 ² When  a  person  damages  the 
life  or  the  property  of  another 
person, criminal law is applied to 
determine the case.

 ² Criminal  law  does  not  have 
is 
different  branches  but 
classified  as  crimes  of  severe 
nature and minor offences. 

it 

 ² Special punishments are imposed 
or  inflicted  by  the  Courts  on 
persons convicted of such crimes 
and offences.
E.g.-  confiscation  of  property 
by  the  state,  capital  punishment, 
imprisonment. 

 ² Criminal  Procedure  of  1979 
and  the  Penal  Code  of  1833  are 
important statutes that deal with 
crimes. 

 ² In  criminal  law,  the  priority 
is  given  to  punishments  and 
rehabilitation.

 ² In  criminal  law  the  complaint 
or indictment is prepared by the 
police or Department of Attorney 
General.

International Law

'Starke'  defines  international  law  as  the  law  that  controls  inter-state 
relationships,  relationship  between  states  and  international  organizations  and  the 
individuals.  Currently  there  are  many  branches  of  law  that  have  emerged  from 
international law.

Eg - International human rights law, environmental law, law of entrepreneurship, 
oceanic  law.  International  Court  of  Justice  and  International  Criminal  Court  to 
dispense with international law.

(01). Kandyan law

Kandyan  law  was  in  operation  during  the  time  of  ancient  Kandyan 
Kingdom. During the period of British rule, this law was restricted only to the 
Sinhalese living in Kandyan territories. Today, this law controls marriage, divorce, 
heirship etc. Kandyan Sinhalese are free to contract marriages under the General 
Law of the country.

(02). Thesawalamai law 

The  term  Thesawalamai  means  the  custom  of  the  land.  This  law  had 
its  origin  in  the  customs  of  the Tamils  resided  in  Northern  province. All  those 
customs were codified into a law in 1706. 

(03)  Muslim law

Muslim law is applicable to anyone who follows Islam. Al-Quran, 
Al-Hadees,  Sunnahs,  Ijma  and  Kiyas  are  the  documents  that  are  considered  as 
sources of Islamic law. Mohamadan Code made in 1806 is currently operative in 
Sri Lanka. 

Eg- Muslim marriages and divorce, estate rights, adoptation, maintenance etc are 
governed by this law. Quazi courts were set up in 1929 for the first time to close 
cases according to Muslim law.

The responsibility of a state is to establish a good society in the country 
while preserving and maintaining  law and order. It is essential to work according 
to indigenous laws when the law is in conflict with the other laws of the country. It 
is also important to bring dignity to the country when dealing with other countries 

under the international law.

Judicial system in Sri Lanka

Evolution of judicial system in Sri Lanka

The judicial system in Sri Lanka has had its origin in the monarchical era. 
The  king  was  the  highest  and  the  supreme  judicial  officer  while  judiciary  was 
functioning under an unwritten system of law. The final appeal on any judgement 
was also made to him. 

Fig. 1.1 Kandy Magul Maduwa the royal court

Portuguese  continued  to  apply  the  ancient  Sinhala  judicial  system  in  Sri 
Lanka  during  their  rule.  Judicial  powers  were  exercised  by  Korale,  Disave  and 
Vidane while village council system or gam sabha was also continued. During the 
period of the Dutch there were three judicial districts namely Colombo, Jaffna and 
Galle. They employed a systematic judicial system.

The judicial system was made much more systematic during the period of 
British colonial rule. Accordingly, the Roman –Dutch law introduced by the Dutch 
was  also  applied  further  by  the  British  judicial  system.  During  that  period,  one 
could appeal to the privy council of England against a decision given by an apex 
court in Sri Lanka. Constitutional reforms in 1972 abolished that power. According

to  the  Law  of  Dispensing  Justice  introduced  in  1973,  the  Supreme  Court  of  Sri 
Lanka was made as the apex court while the Court Of Appeal, High Court, District 
Court,  Magistrate  Court  and  the  Primary  Courts  remained  as  other  courts  of  the 
judicial system of Sri Lanka.

Alternative methods of resolving disputes

Several  alternative  methods  have  been  established  in  Sri  Lanka  before 
going to a judiciary to resolve a problem. It provides an opportunity for the people 
to save their money, time and labour while getting an immediate solution which is 
agreeable to both parties. Some of those methods are as follows.

Arbitration

Problems  arised  between  employers  and  employees  are  harmful  for  the 
respective institution as well as for the existence of the country. Working on solving 
those  disputes  within  a  legal  framework  is  known  as  the  arbitration.  Industrial 
settlement Act of 1950 can be used for that.

Arbitration 

Voluntary Arbitration 

Compulsory Arbitration 

Resolving problem by the      
parties after informing the 
commissioner of labour affairs

to a resolution is called an arbitrator. One or more arbitrators may involve in the 
arbitration procedure.

In  the  process  of  arbitration,  a  report  on  dispute  is  given  to  the  arbitrator 
by the commissioner of labour. The arbitrator contents an investigation of dispute 
that should be finished within a reasonable time frame. If there are other parties 
related to the dispute, they should also participate in it. The decision is given after 
obtaining the ideas of both parties. The decision should be published in Gazette by 
the commissioner of labour to ensure the legality. The parties can also reject the 
decision.

Ombudsman

The post of Ombudsman or parliamentary commissioner for administration

Rule of Law  

Rule  of  law  means  ruling  a  country  on  the  basis  of  the  supremacy  of  the 
law.  Every  individual  and  institution  is  expected  to  work  according  to  the  law. 
Constitutional law is the most supreme law in our country and everyone is obliged 
to work according to it. 

G. Martial has also mentioned about three characteristics that influence the 

rule of law.

Features that 
influence the concept 
of rule of law

Everyone being subject to the law

Enforcement of law through an 
independent judiciary with equity 
and equality 

Availability of an impartial, 
specific, reasonable, just, common 
system of law

According to the above qualities some of the features seen in a society where 

the rule of law has been established are as follows:

 ² Availability of an independent judicial system

 ² Awareness of every citizen about law

 ² Not treating ignorance of the law as an excuse

 ² Dispensing law impartially without any delay

 ² Not exercising law on the basis of status, profession, wealth or any other matters

 ² Treating everyone equally before the law

 ² Not exerting influence on judges in their decision making

When this concept is exercised, the extreme conditions that can badly affect 

individuals can be minimized so that a fair and just society can be established.

Independence of the Judiciary

Judiciary  occupies  a  significant  place  in 
modern society. The reason is the priority given for 
judiciary for safeguarding rights and freedom as well 
as to ensure justice and equity.

When  the  judiciary  is  independent  and 
impartial,  a  confidence  is  built  up  in  individuals 
about judiciary. People tend to live while respecting 
law under such conditions.  Constitution of 1978 has 
provided many provisions to safeguard independence 
of judiciary.

The use of goddess Athena as the symbol of

judicial affairs, indicates the fact that it functions with an equity, impartiality in a 
moderate manner. Some of the provisions introduced to safeguard independence of 
judiciary are as follows:

 ² Appointment of  judges

Judges are appointed by H.E. the President under the recommendation of 
the constitutional council. The age of retirement is mentioned and they cannot be 
removed before it. They can hold the post as long as they are in good health.

 ² Removal of judges

There  has  been  a  special  procedure  proposed  in  the  constitution.  This 
procedure also expects to ensure job security. So that  they can give Judgements 
independently and impartially.

 ² Salaries of judges

Salaries are paid to the judges through a consolidated fund. It is also a step 
to safeguard independence of judiciary. Accordingly, the budget has no reference to 
the allocations related to judges. Salaries of the judges of Supreme Court and Court 
of Appeal are decided by the parliament. 

 ² Accepting other positions

According  to  the  constitution  it  is  strictly  prohibited  for  the  judges  of 
Supreme  Court  or  Court  of  Appeal  to  accept  any  other  paid  or  non  paid  post 
without approval of the H.E. President. They should not be employed in any other 
profession. 

This also prevails as a provision to ensure the independence of judiciary. 

 ² Restriction of unnecessary involvements and control.

To ensure independent judiciary, infaluencing judicial affairs was determined 
to be a punishable offence. Judges can function without being subject to any other 
influences due to this provision.

 ² Establishing judicial service commission

Establishment of judicial service commission is also a step to safeguard 
the independence of judiciary. Chief Justice is the President of this commission 
while  two  other  judges  are  members.  Members  are  appointed  by  H.E.  the 
President for a period of five years.

 ² Do you think judiciary should be independent? State 5 reasons supporting it.

Importance of dispensing law impartially without any delay

Taking much time for a trial can lead to dilute the confidence of citizens 
about the law and judiciary. Drawbacks or delay of dispensing justice can make 
an injustice for those who are affected.

Some  of  the  demerits  of  unnecessary  delay  and  not  dispensing  justice 

impartially are as follows:

 ² Decline of the confidence of individuals on judicial system and the law

 ² Rise of anarchy instead of the law

 ²

Increase of crime and corruptions in the country

 ² Deterioration of equity and equality of law in the country.

 ² Tendency to use illegal methods to achieve justice

 ² Spending much money and time to fulfill the justice

 ² Decline of people's respect to judiciary and the law

Independence of judiciary and dispensing justice efficiently with equity are 
essential to minimize above situations and to achieve the concept of good governance 
in the country.

  It is also a prime duty of the citizens to work while respecting the law and 
judicial system of the country peacefully. Every citizen should abide by law since 
it is a tool that prefects peaceful and justifiable societies.

Various Strata of the 

Government

Introduction

 The prime responsibility of a democratic government is to fulfill the 
needs  of  citizens  to  the  maximum  level.  It  is  important  to  study  various 
strata of the government and their functions to know the extent to which the 
government  fulfills  the  responsibilities.  Human  needs  are  complex  in  the 
modern society and the function of government has also become complex 
in relation to these needs. These complex set of functions are performed by 
various bodies at different levels of government.

 This  unit  will  discuss  three  main  levels  of  government;  the  central 
government,  provincial  councils  and  local  authorities.  The  main  areas  to  be 
focussed are:

 ² Comparison of past and present structure of these bodies.

 ² Functions  of  these  bodies  at  each  level,  the  effectiveness  of  their 

activities and problems faced by them in practice.

 ²

In  exercising  the  functions  of  those  different  bodies  at  each  level,  the 
benefits, accountability and responsibility of respective bodies, as well as 
the duties and responsibilities of the citizens who are benefitted have also 
been emphasized.

In this unit students are expected to improve competencies regarding the 
features and characteristics of different levels of the government, their functions, 
effectiveness as well as the obligations of citizens with respect to them. 

  The system of government  in Sri Lanka at present is a liberal democratic 
and  unitary  system.  Unitary  system  of  government  means  a  system  in  which 
powers are centered around the central authority. It is also defined as a government

in  which  all  executive,  legislative  and  judicial  powers  are  exercised  by  a  single 
central government.

 ² Fundamental  feature  of  a  unitary  government  is  that  one  central 

authority possesses the supreme power of enacting law

 ² A unitary government has two fundamental features

- A. V. Dicey

 1. The supremacy of the central government

 2. The absence of subsidiary sovereign bodies

- C. N. Strong

 Developed countries such as Great Britain, Japan, France as well as developing 

countries such as Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal are examples of unitary states.

Sri  Lanka  has  a  unitary  system  of  government.  It  has  a  long  history  of  a 
central and local government system. Even in the past there had been regional 
administrative units in addition to the central government. Those units were, 

 ² Uththara Passa

 ² Pracheena Passa

 ² Dakkhina Passa

 ² Pashchima Passa 

By the end of Anuradhapura era there were several administrative  units, 
namely, Rajarata, Dhakkina Desha, Dolos Dahas Rata, Ata Dahas Rata. During 
the  British  colonial  period  there  were  administrative  units  known  as  Disava, 
Korala, Patthu etc.

Provincial Council System of Sri Lanka 

Several attempts have been made to decentralize administrative powers of Sri 

Lanka as follows:

 ² Report of Donoughmore Commission in 1928.

 ² Report of Soulbury Commission in 1945.

 ² Rata Sabha Bandaranayake – Chelvanayagam Pact - 1957

 ² District Councils Dudley Senanayake – Chelvanayagam Pact -1965

 ² District Development Councils in 1980.

  13th  Amendment  and  Provincial  Council  Act  No.42  of  1987  provided 
constitutional  and  legal  provisions  for  the  formation  of  Provincial  Councils. 
According to the constitution of 1978, the provisions were introduced to set up a 
Provincial Council for each province. According to 8th schedule of the constitution 
of 1978, the country has been divided into nine provinces.

Provincial  Councils  are  formed  in  order  to  decentralize    Executive, 
Legislative and Judicial powers concentrated in the Central Government. “Provincial 
Councils” are comprised of representatives elected from direct votes of the people.

Local Government System in Sri Lanka

Historical facts prove the fact that Local Authories in Sri Lanka has a long 

history. Some of the examples are as follows:

 ² Those who held some responsibilities were called by titles such as Gamika, 

Parumaka, Gambojaka. Mayors were called as Nagara guttika

 ² According  to  Wewalkatiya  Inscription,  there  has  been  a  ruling  system 
called  “Dasa  Gam  Palanaya”  or  ruling  by  taking  ten  villages  as  a  single 
administrative unit

 ² Even in Kandyan Kingdom the same type of administrative system prevailed 

 ²

32

It  has  been  reported  that  the  Kandyan  Kingdom  had  been  divided  into  04 
'maha disa', 08 'disa' and 09 'rata'

 ² Reports of Robert Knox in 1681 prove that the village had been ruled by a 

village council or a gam sabha

Obtaining the people’s participation in administrative affairs and preparing 
central government’s policies on the basis of the views of the people in localities 
are the functions expected from local government bodies. These local government 
bodies are classified as regional and urban and they are comprised of representatives 
elected by the people. The function of these bodies is to exercise powers of central 
government in regional level. Different types of local government bodies has been 
formed in Sri Lanka in order to achieve a formal community development in order 
to ensure more efficient community service.

 ² Establishing  Municipal  Councils  under  Municipal  Council  Act  in  1865- 

Colombo-Kandy-Galle

 ² Establishing Gam Sabha under the Ordinance of 1934

 ² Establishing Urban Councils under the Ordinance in 1939

 ² Establishing Town Councils under the Ordinance of 1956

 ² Establishing  District  Development  Councils  by  abolishing  Town  Councils 

and Gamsabha in 1980

 ² Establishing Pradeshiya Sabha in 1987

Local  government  system  is  practised  in  Sri  Lanka  in  order  to  delegate 
administrative  affairs  of  the  central  government  so  as  to  fulfill  the  public  needs 
and requirements more efficiently.

Central Government, Provincial Councils and Local Authorities are the main 

tiers of the administrative mechanism of Sri Lanka.

Reasons for decentralizing powers of the government to regional units

  Provincial  Council  system  and  Local Authorities  in  Sri  Lanka  have  been 
established  for  decentralizing  powers  of  Central  Government.  The  objectives  of 
devolving power on regional level administrative units are,

 ² Conferring powers to people in provincial level within a unitary structure
 ² Ensuring cultural and language identities of people in provincial level

 ² Minimizing workload of the Central Government

Problems in decentralizing powers

 ² Some regional units are benefited while some other units are not, due to the 

disparity in distribution of resources

 ² Lack of knowledge of the people about the ways of getting their needs fulfilled

 ² Problems arising from the execution of power between the central government 

and regional units

 ²

Inadequate  power  devolved  on  the  Provincial  Councils  and  the  Local 
Authorities for the implemention of development programmes 

 ² Difficulties in allocation of funds for implementing development plans

Human Rights and Duties

Introduction

Rights inherent to all human beings by birth without any discrimintion 
can  be  called  human  rights.  Accordingly,  being  aware  of  human  rights, 
accepting and respecting them, executing the duties related to human rights, 
not  only  being  in  the  formation  of  a  democratic  society  the  welfare  of  the 
citizens but also establishes peace and equality in the society. 

Hence,  being  aware  of  human  rights  and  developing  the  skills  of 
implementing them practically in social life are essential to live in society as 
a virtuous citizen. Studying this chapter thoroughly will be helpful for you to 
develop the competencies in you.

Human Rights

Rights inherent to all human beings by birth can be called as 'human rights'.
Therefore, human rights accommodate living in the society as human beings with 
dignity and equality. 

Being human is the primary and sole requirement to be entitled to human 
rights.  We  call  this  as  humanity  in  common.  Human  rights  have  become  the 
foundation protecting the dignity and the well being of human being. In a society 
which obstructs the enjoyment of human rights, difficulties arise in the maintenance 
of security and completion of human development. Accordingly, human rights are 
essential to protect the dignity and existence of human life.

In addition to that, the concept of human rights is universal which is based on 
equity and equality. Safeguarding democracy, upgrading the social  status of citizens, 
and the growth of social justice as well as equality are the main components of a 
society where the rights are ensured.

Important historical events in relation to achieving Human Rights 

Though every individual is entitled to enjoy human rights, man has undergone 
several restrictions in different periods in the history when enjoying human rights. 
The age of slavery and medieval eras provided many examples of this situation.

With  the  gradual  development  of  human  society,  man  has  focused  his 
attention on his rights too. He had to fight against the rulers, struggle and enter into 
treaties with them in order to acquire his rights. Some of those important historical 
events of achievements of human rights are as follows.

Human Rights Charter

 ² 1215 AD  

- Magna Carta Treaty of Britain 

 ² 1689 AD  

- British Bill of rights Act

 ² 1789 AD  

- United States Declaration of Independence 

- French Declaration of man and citizen

 ² 1917 AD  

- Russian Revolution

Thus it is obvious that man demands rights mainly due to his desire to spend 
a free and independent life. Therefore the process related to rights consists of two  
main aspects.

    Rights

Those who 
demand for rights

Those who are bound 
to give rights

Digram 3.2 :  -The Process related to Rights

The First World War began in 1914 and continued up to 1918. Then two 
decades later the Second World War began. It continued from 1939 to 1945. The 
result of these wars was destructive.

Hundreds  of  thousands  of  people  died.  Large  number  of  people  became 
disabled.  Millions  of  children  and  women  became  helpless.  Destruction  of  the 
property  was  immense.  Therefore  the  world  wars  can  be  regarded  as  instances 
when human rights were severely violated. 

Therefore the leaders of the world paid attention on maintaining world peace, 
improving  co-existence  among  nations  and  safeguarding  human  rights.  United 
Nations Organization was established in 1945 in order to fullfill these objectives. 
The organization paid great attention on safeguarding human rights. As a result, the 
Universal Declaration on Human Rights was passed in the General Assembly on 
the 10th Of February 1948. It was an important step for safeguarding human rights.

Universal Declaration of Human Rights of UNO – Article 01

 ² All human beings are born free

 ² They are equal in terms of dignity and rights

 ² They should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood

 ² They are endowed with reason and conscience

This declaration has clearly mentioned the fact that all human beings should 
be given rights on an equitable basis. It also emphasizes the duties to be fulfilled by 
man while enjoying these rights.

It is the duty of all of us to accept the fact that all are equally entitled 
to  rights  and  our  obligation  is  to  enjoy  these  rights  with  responsibility  and 
understanding.  Fulfilling  duties  while  enjoying  rights  directly  contributes  to 
social development. It ensures the existence of a democratic society. Therefore 
it is essential in social life to have knowledge about rights and duties as well as 
the way they are fulfilled.

United  Nations  General Assembly  has  made  a  request  from  school  and 
educational institutions to exhibit these rights in order to raise awareness among 
people.

This  request  clearly  indicates  you,  as  students  the  importance  of  having 
knowledge about human rights. This knowledge provides an opportunity for you 
to spend a good life while enjoying rights. Performing one's duties related to rights 
contributes to safeguard rights of the other members of the society. By doing that, 
you can ensure the establishment of a democratic and peaceful society.

Activity 3.1

 ² Prepare an article on the topic " the importance of raising awareness among 

students about Human Rights", to be displayed on school wall paper.

 ² Select some  important historical events important for achieving Human 
Rights and collect information about the rights achieved in those events.

Digram 3.3 :  - Classification of Rights

Out of the Human rights which are essential to the human being, some of the 
main selected rights have been added to the constitutions by most of the countries. 
They are known as fundamental rights. 

Accordingly  every  fundamental  right  is  a  human  right  but  every  human 
right is not a fundamental right. Once the fundamental rights are violated, One can 
get the refuge of the law. 

Fundamental rights are mentioned in chapter III of the present constitution.

Article 126 ensures the actions to be taken once the rights are violated. 

Everyone is equally entitled to human rights and United Nations Organization 

has taken steps to safeguard the rights of special groups.

E.g. The steps taken to safeguard the rights of children and women 

On  the  basis  of  the  nature  of  the  rights  they  can  be  classified  as  Civil, 

Political, Economic and Social rights.

An optional convention was passed in 1966 with the convention on civil 
and  political  rights.  It  is  the  first  optional  protocol  which  is  related  to  interna-
tional convention on political and civil rights.

The second optional protocol aimed at abolishing capital punishment was 

passed in 1989. These two optional protocols are as follows.

The First Optional Protocol to the International Convention on Civil and 
Political Rights (ICCPR)

This optional protocol consists of 14 articles. This optional protocol has 
provided an opportunity to complain the Human Rights Committee set up by the 
protocol, in case where a person is not satisfied with final result of the judicial 
process concerning the violation of Human Rights in his own country.

In order to make this kind of a complaint to the Human Rights Committee, 
the respective country where the particular person lives, should have signed and 
accepted this protocol.

International Human Rights Day is celebrated on the 10th of December 
in  every  year.  Prepare  a  speech  to  be  presented  in  the  morning 
assembly on the topic "International Acts on Human Rights".

In  the  present  day,  it  is  accepted  that  the  rights  discussed  above  should 
be  ensured  with  respect  to  each  individual  and  as  a  group. Accordingly  groups 
of people who face problems are recognized. They are paid special attention and 
various international documents on human rights have been passed to ensure their 
human rights.

Rights of Women

Family is the smallest social unit of a community of people. The functions 
performed by the women as a mother of the family is invaluable. Through functions 
like  giving  birth  to  children,  giving  protection  to  them,  fulfillment  of  food  and 
nutrition requirements of the family, and providing education to them, the mother 
performs a great service to the welfare of the family as well as the wellbeing of the 
society.

The  labour  contribution  of    the  women  with  regard  to  the  functions  of 
the family and the national economy is commendable. She also performs a very 
important social service by shouldering various responsibilities associated with 
different roles played by her in the society.

We know about special occasions even in the past in which the women in 
the Oriental Countries had been regarded important. The Sapta Aparihani Dharma 
seven factors of non degeneration, practised during the reign of Lichchavi in the 
6th  Century  B.C.  in  India  can  be  taken  as  an  example. Two  of  the  facts  under 
Sapta Aparihani Dharma deal with the fact providing protection to women. Those 
two facts followed by the Lichchavi kings are given below:

1. Protection of maidens

2. Protection of the married women

Fundamental reason for the society to pay much attention towards women 
is  the  respect  for  motherhood  which  has  been  prevailing  in  the  society  from 
ancient times.

Fig. 3.1 :- Social services rendered by women

When enjoying human rights there are many occasions in which women 
face social discrimination at present. Being subjected to violence, facing various 
types of abuses and being subjected to discrimination are some examples of such 
situations.

Considering women as a group which should attract special attention of 
the  society  the  Convention  on  the  Elimination  of  all  forms  of  Discrimination 
against Women (CEDAW) was adopted in 1979 by the United Nations General 
Assembly with the idea of securing the rights guaranteed by the United Nations 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Convention  on  the  Elimination  of  all  Forms  of  Discrimination 
Against Women

The primary objective of this convention was the eradication of all forms 
of  discrimination  against  women.  This  convention  was  adopted  on  the  18th  of 
December 1979 by the United Nations and implemented on the 03rd of September 
1987. Sri Lanka also ratified this convention. Article 3 of this convention is given

Child Rights

Children are the greatest asset of parents. They are also the most valuable 
resource of a country and the world. The reason for this is the fact that they are 
considered the back bone of the nation. Therefore it is important to direct children 
through a better present to a beneficial future.

If children are deprived of the opportunity to enjoy their rights it becomes 
a barrier for their proper growth. It may hinder the child from entering the future 
society as a good citizen.

Employing  children  as  child  labourers,  abusing  them,  recruiting  them 
as  child  soldiers,  abducting,  not  sending  them  to  schools,  harassing  them  are 
examples for the instances of child rights violations.

Children become victims of war in 
countries where they undergo harasments, 
lose  parents,  become  refugees,  get  killed, 
suffer  from  malnutrition  and  expose  to 
severe threats. First and second world wars 
are examples of such dreadful situations.

Such dreadful situations compelled 
the world to focus its attention on the need 
to safeguard rights of children.

In consequence of various efforts  
made  by  countries  to  safeguard  child 
rights,  the  General  Assembly  of  the 
United Nations adopted the Convention 
on Child Rights on the 20th November 
1989.  This  Convention  came  into  effect  since  1991.  Sri  Lanka  also  ratified 
this convention.

Fig. 3.2  :- Children affected by war

The  United  Nations  Charter  on  Human  Rights,  Geneva  Declaration  on 
Child  Rights  (1924)  and  many  other  international  documents  were  considered

children, losing the right to education, deprivation of protection and love of parents, 
and bereavement of health facilities.Accordingly, such situations directly influence 
child rights violations It is the duty and the responsibility of the entire society to 
prevent children facing such situations.

Persons with Special needs

Capabilities are not equal in every person living in the society. There are some 
persons living with us in this society who suffer from conditions of disabilities such 
as physical, mental, intellectual disabilities. Perhaps these disabilities may be inborn. 
Or else, they may have been the result of accidents faced by them later in their life.

Eventhough  they  are  disabled,  like  other  ordinary  people  living  in  the 
society, they too have specific capabilities, proficiencies and skills. You may have 
heard about visually impaired persons who have excelled in certain capabilities such 
as in aesthetics. You may also know about situations in which persons with certain 
disabilities  perform  great  service  to  the  country  after  completing  their  education 
through specific methods.

By improving the capabilities of persons with disabilities they will get the 

ability to perform a great service to the country.

The United Nations have taken steps to protect the rights of persons with 
disabilities by paying special attention to them. Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities adopted in 2006 is an important step taken for the protection of 
rights of persons with disabilities. The Convention on the Rights of Children has 
also taken further steps to protect the rights of persons with disabilities.

The Indigenous and Tribal people

Indigenous  people  possess  a  culture  specific  to  them.  Food,  clothing, 
customs, habits, language, beliefs and values, morals, etc. are examples of factors 
that reflect these specialities. Among them are arts like dancing and songs specific 
to them.

The  World  Labour  Organization  in  1989  introduced  the  Indigenous  and 
Tribal  People's  Convention  for  the  protection  of  rights  of  indigenous  and  tribal 
people.  Recognizing  the  aspirations  of  these  people  to  exercise  control  over 
their  own  institutions,  ways  of  life  and  to  maintain  and  develop  their  identities, 
languages and religions, within the framework of the States in which they live is 
one of the main objectives of this convention. According to this convention another 
main objective of it is to set up the background necessary for the maintenance of 
occupations, languages, customs and traditions, beliefs, ways of life further as they 
prevailed historically.

The aborigines living in Sri Lanka are called “Veddas”. It is the responsibility 
of all the citizens living in a country to treat these people as a special group and 
provide  them  with  opportunities  to  enjoy  the  rights  they  have  as  aborigines  and 
respect their rights.

Elders (Senior citizens)

Even  though  there  is  no  internationally  recognized  age  limit  to  identify 
elders in Sri Lanka the retirement age for the state sector employees is between the 
ages of 55 - 60. This age group can be regarded as the border line to be considered 
as a senior citizen.

A  senior  citizen  is  a  person  who  sacrificed  his/her  time  and  labour  for 
the  economic  and  social  development  of  the  country  during  his/her  youth  as  a 
government servant, a private sector worker, a self-employed person or a person 
engaged in an employment abroad. They also have rendered a great service for the 
wellbeing of the society.

Accordingly, it is the responsibility of both the government and the society 
to provide them the opportunity to lead a good and satisfied life. it is quite essential 
to establish in the society the room for them as adults to lead a life which safeguards 
their freedom, independence, security and dignity. In the same way giving them the 
opportunity to use their knowledge, capabilities and experiences, for the benefit of

of them to take part in various social activities.

Various social insurance systems have been implemented out in Sri Lanka 
for  the  benefit  of  elders.  Specially,  it  is  the  duty  and  responsibility  of  both  the 
society and the family unit to provide opportunity for the adults to lead a happy and 
contended social life.

It is expected that in future, among Asian countries, including Sri Lanka the 
percentage of elderly population will take a higher value. Therefore, more attention 
should be given to the protection of their rights.

Domestically, Sri Lanka has passed an Act of Parliament for the Protection 
of Rights of Elders (No 09, 2000). Internationally, too, special attention is paid to 
the protection of rights of elders.

Activity 3.6

 ² Name  the  activities  you  can  carry  out  as  a  member  of  the  family  to

welfare of elders.

Labour Rights

The services performed by working people in the development process of 
a country are immense. Therefore, it is essential to establish social fairness for the 
working  population.  Proper  maintenance  of  employer  -  employee  relationship  is 
also essential for the development of a country.

International Labour Organization was established in 1919 with the objective 
of bringing social equity for the working population. In 1946 International Labour 
Organization functioned as an affiliated institution to the United Nations. The main 
objectives of the ILO are to promote rights at work, encourage decent employment 
opportunities, enhance social protection and strengthen dialogue on work-related 
issues. The ILO has adopted several Conventions with the objective of protecting 

68

the  rights  of  the  workers.  Sri  Lanka  has  become  a  member  of  the  ILO  in  1948. 
Sri Lanka also has ratified and has taken steps to implement several conventions 
adopted by the ILO.

Protection of Labour Rights 

Given below are the examples of some Acts passed and implemented by Sri 
Lanka with the objective of proper maintenance of relationship between employers 
and employees.

 ² Shops and Office Employees Act

 ² Maternity Benefits Ordinance

 ²

Industrial Disputes Act

 ² Wages Board Ordinance

 ² Employees Provident Fund Act

Opportunity should be given for the employees to enjoy the rights such 
as wages sufficient to meet their needs ( a living wage), holidays and leaves, job 
security,  social  security,  health  facilities,  etc  in  order  to  perform  their  services 
with satisfaction.

If  the  employees  are  entitled  to  these  rights  it  will  lead  to  create  healthy 
employer employee relationship, generate industrial peace and will also be able to 
maintain higher level of labour productivity.

When  enjoying  these  rights  fulfilling  properly  the  obligations  connected 
with them will lead to protect them further. Performing the duties and obligations 
towards  the  employees  by  the  employers  will  be  effective  in  bringing  success 
to  one’s  industries  and  business  services.  Maintaining  proper  relationships 
between  the  employer  and  employees  in  this  manner  will  contribute  to 
success  of  the  production  process  as  well  as  the  development  of  the  country.

Obligations connected with the Environmental Rights

The surroundings around us can simply be called the environment. Land, 

water, atmosphere, soil, plants and animals include the natural environment.

Since ancient times, man has opted to change the environment in various 
ways in order to fulfill his needs. The Industrial Revolution which started in the 
18th  Century  caused  environmental  pollution  in  many  ways.  With  the  growth  of 
population and human needs becoming complex the changes that took place in the 
production processes, too, influenced environmental pollution.

Pure drinking water, clean air, facilities essential to live in an unpolluted 
environment are the basic environmental rights which are necessary to safeguard 
the right to live.

However, the attempts made by man in order to upgrade the living conditions 

of him have unfavorably influenced environmental pollution.

This principle emphasizes both the right of man to the environment as well 
as  obligations  that  man  has  to  fulfill  towards  the  environment.  Because  of  this 
mankind is obliged to pay special attention to the fulfillment of certain duties and 
responsibilities in order to protect the environmental rights.

Fulfillment  of  moral  obligations  and  acting  in  accordance  with  rules  and 
regulations  enacted  In  relation  to  such  actions  like  protection  of  water  sources, 
protection  of  forests  and  wild  animals,  proper  disposal  of  waste  matter  will 
contribute to safeguard the environmental rights possessed by humankind.

The main law governing the environmental protection of Sri Lanka is the 
National Environmental Act of 1980. The central institution that deals with matters 
covered by this Act is the Central Environmental Authority.

Given below are some examples of institutions/departments that deal with 

environmental protection in Sri Lanka.

 ² Ministry of Environment

 ² Forest Conservation Department

 ² The Geological Survey & Mines Bureau

 ² The Marine Environment Protection Authority

 ² Department of Wildlife Conservation

 ² Coast Conservation & Coastal Resource Management Department

It  is  the  duty  and  responsibility  of  all  of  us  to  act  in  accordance  with 
the  standards  planned  and  implemented  by  these  institutions  and  personally 
contributing to the conservation of the environment so as to establish the right to 
live in a healthy environment

Growth of the statutory provisions of Human Rights in Sri Lanka  

Inclusion of Fundamental Rights chapter in the First Republican Constitution 
of  Sri  Lanka  (1972)  can  be  considered  as  an  important  step  in  relation  to  this. 
Article 18 of the First Republican Constitution of Sri Lanka includes provisions 
related to Fundamental Rights.

However, this Constitution does not mention provisions for the protection 
of the Fundamental Rights or measures that can be taken in instances of violating 
these rights.

The Third Chapter of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka (The 
Second Republican Constitution) contains Fundamental Rights. Article 10 to 14 of 
the Constitution deal with Fundamental Rights

Fundamental Rights

Article 10

 ² Every  person  is  entitled  to  freedom  of  thought,  conscience  and  religion, 
including the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice.

 ² Freedom of choosing his residence within Sri Lanka.

Measures that can be taken when Fundamental Rights are violated

 ² As stated in Article 17 and 126 of the 1978 Constitution, a person is entitled to 
make an application to the Supreme Court regarding the violation or imminent 
violation of a Fundamental Right over Executive or Administrative action.

 ² Complaints  about  violation  of  fundamental  rights  can  be  forwarded  to  the 

Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka.

 ² A  complaint  can  be  made  to  the  Parliamentary  Commissioner  for 
Administration or Ombudsman regarding a violation of a Fundamental Right 
by an Administrative Action.

Since Sri Lanka has also  signed and accepted the First Optional Protocol to 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that we discussed earlier, 
in a legal case dealing with the violation of human rights, an individual who has 
exhausted all available domestic remedies should complain to the United Nations 
Human Rights Committee.

Present situation of the enjoyment of Human Rights in Sri Lanka

The  Constitution  of  Sri  Lanka  provides  opportunity  for  an  individual  to 
seek the interference of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka to redress of a violation 
or imminent violation of the Fundamental Right guaranteed by the Constitution by 
Executive or Administrative Action.

The Supreme Court takes action to inquire into and determine the petitions 
presented to in this manner and deliver fair decisions by providing suitable remedies. 

The task of inquiring into and reporting, subjected to the provisions of law, 
of the Violation of Fundamental Rights by the State officers and officers attached to 
government affiliated corporations, Local Government and other such institutions is 
carried out by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration or Ombudsman.

Citizens  are  given  the  opportunity  of  complaining  about  violation  of 
fundamental rights to the Human Rights Commission. The function of The Human 
Rights Commission is to inquire into the complaints of violation of Human Rights 
and  suggest  appropriate  recommendations.  This  process  also  guarantees  the 
Fundamental Rights of the citizens of Sri Lanka. Other than these processes there 
are various strategies operated in Sri Lanka to raise awareness among citizens for 
the fulfillment of human rights and obligations.

Through  the  inclusion  of  sections  of  the  subject  of  Human  Rights  in  the 
syllabi of the National Institute of Education, Schools and Colleges of Education 
the  student  community  is  made  aware  of  Human  Rights  and  obligations.  These 
strategies will contribute to build up a future generation who will respect Human 
Rights and fulfills duties and responsibilities connected with them.

Steps  have  been  taken  to  raise  awareness  among  student  population 
about  Human  Rights  and  obligations  through  academic  courses  conducted  by 

74

taken to raise awareness among officers attached to law, peace and public security 
and government officers attached to various other spheres by organizing training 
courses about the upliftment of conditions regarding human rights in Sri Lanka.

In  this  manner,  awareness  about  human  rights  and  duties  by  the  general 

public will establish good governance in a democratic society.

Activity 3.9

 ² Collect  newspaper  articles  which  contain  information  about  Supreme 
Court  determinations  on  petitions  on  the  incidents  of  violation  of 
Fundamental Rights.

 ² Study those reports well.

Limitations of the enjoyment of Fundamental Rights

The  concept  of  Human  Rights  is  important  as  a  moral  concept.  On  the 
basis of freedom and equality, laws and other provisions are implemented for the 
provision of equal enjoyment of Human Rights by all.

At  the  same  time,  we  are  subjected  to  certain  restrictions  and  limitations 

when enjoying Human Rights. Nobody can restrict the rights enjoyed by another.

Even though a person can walk along the road by waving his walking stick the 
freedom  should end at the tip of the other person’s nose

Harold Laski

Article  15  of  the  1978  Constitution  states  the  limitations  of  enjoying  the 
Fundamental Rights. Accordingly, the power to impose restrictions on the grounds 
of national defense, promotion of ethnic and religious harmony, safeguarding the 
national economy, public health, protection and respect of the rights of others are 
stated in the Constitution.

As an example of such a situation is that when there are military or civil 
struggles  or  violence  in  the  country  the  government  has  the  authority  to  control 
media for the benefit of the public.

Role of citizens in safeguarding Human Rights

Evidence can be presented to show the fact that since ancient times it had 
been a habit of Sri Lankans to fulfill their duties and responsibilities. Looking after 
the elders by the family members, fulfillment of one’s duties and responsibilities 
towards them have become a tradition since ancient times. In the same way our 
ancient  cultural  heritage  witnesses  that  Sri  Lankans  have  sacrificed  their  labour, 
capabilities, and skills for the country.

Even when they enjoy resources found in the environment they paid special 

attention to perform human activities while protecting the natural environment.

Fulfillment of duties and responsibilities connected with rights is a fundamental 
feature of a democratic way of living. Fulfillment of one’s duties and responsibilities 
further safeguards one’s rights as well as the rights of others. Furthermore, fulfillment 
of duties connected with the rights leads to establish wellbeing of democratic society 
as well as the qualities like peace, harmony and unity.

Civil  responsibilities  connected  with  rights  can  be  classified  in  the 

following manner.

Duties

Legal Duties

Moral Duties

Diagram 3.6

The duties that should be performed by a citizen according to the prevailing 
laws  of  the  country  can  simply  be  introduced  as  legal  duties.  Payment  of  taxes 
imposed by the government, abide by laws, bound to protect the Constitution of the 
country are some examples of legal duties. Disregard or neglect of legal duties may 
liable to be punished according to law. Care for the adults; look after them, respect 
the customs and traditions and upholding of them are examples of moral duties.

Treating  teachers;  respecting  and  maintaining  social  customs  practices; 
protecting  the  environment,  national  heritages  and  resources;  and  protecting  the 
culture are a few examples for moral duties. 

Abstaining from dangerous drugs, smoking and malpractices is a moral that 
is gererally accepted by society. Every individual has a moral right to abstain from 
such misdeeds and lead an exemplary life. In addition to it safeguarding the society 
from such activities becomes a moral duty of a citizen with good conduct.

Failure  to  fulfill  moral  duties  may  cause  loss  of  social  recognition  and 
respect may be subject to displeasure of the society towards that person. Fulfillment 
of  moral  duties  properly  may  directly  influence  the  dignity,  respect  and  social 
recognition of that person.

Fundemental duties

The constitution of Sri Lanka mentions both fundemental rights and duties. 
Aritcle  28  of  1978  constitution  of  Sri  Lanka  states  the  fundemental  duties.  (Pay 
your attention to the facts you studied about 'Duties of Citizens' in the first chapter 
of grade 10 Civic Education) ( Page 24,25)

The role of the citizen in safeguarding Human Rights 

Fulfilling the duties as a family member

The social unit that a person gets membership with his birth is the family. 

We all live as members of a family.

Think of the rights that a person enjoys as a member of a family. Food and 
nutrition, love and affection, protection and security, education are some examples 
of the rights entitled to from the family. Parent and elders provide these facilities to 
you regarding them as duties and responsibilities they have towards you.

In return for the enjoyment of these rights your obligation is to fulfill your 
duties  and  responsibilities  towards  your  parents  and  adults  which  in  turn  will 
safeguard not only your rights but the rights of your parents and adults as well. It is 
quite important to consider these obligations as moral obligations or duties. Mutual 
fulfillment  of  duties  and  responsibilities  towards  each  other  as  family  members 
will bring stability and progress of the family. It further establishes and strengthens 
bonds among the members of the family.

Fulfillment of duties as a member of the family   

Other than the family unit the most important institution that contributes to 
build up a person’s life in a proper manner is the school. Think of the rights that you 
enjoy as a member of the school.

An important fact that you should pay your attention to is the fact that the 
government spends a great deal of money for the provision of education to you free 
of charge. Provision of education to you, improvement of your skills and capabilities, 
presenting you to the society as a good citizen are some of the services carried out 
by  the  school.  Pay  your  attention  to  the  duties  and  responsibilities  that  you  have 
towards your school. Engaging in educational activities properly, being obedient to 
your teachers, being disciplined, respecting and safeguarding rules, regulations and 
traditions of the school, utilizing resources of the school while protecting them are 
some examples of the duties that you should fulfill to wards your school.

Enjoyment of the rights that you are entitled to as a student will help you 
to make your future life successful. While enjoying your rights fulfillment of your 

78

duties and responsibilities towards your school may pave the way for you to protect 
your dignity and respect.

Fulfillment of duties as a member of a higher education institute   

When you enter a higher education institution to get higher education, as 
an educated, intelligent citizen enjoying the rights you should make sure that you 
fulfill your duties and responsibilities well.

As a student of a higher education institute while enjoying your rights it is 
very important for you to pay attention to safeguard the rights of others. You should 
also have the determination to engage in educational activities well and enter the 
society as a worthy citizen of the country. The time a person spends as a student of 
a higher education institution should be taken as a very important period of one’s 
educational life. By acting in that manner the student can bring reputation to the 
educational institution. In the same way by completing your education effectively 
you can fulfill the expectations that the country has put on you.

Duties that should be fulfilled while engaging in an occupation

Once you complete your education you will get an opportunity in future to 
engage in an occupation according to the educational and professional qualifications 
that you have gained. Whichever occupation you are engaged in, as workers, you 
should  fulfill  your  duties  and  responsibilities  towards  your  society  as  well  as  to 
your country by carrying out your work with dignity and efficiently.

Whichever  is  the  occupation  it  serves  the  society.  Performing  the  duties 
related  to  your  occupation  honestly  and  with  dedication  will  bring  progress  not 
only to your society but to your country as well. You should determine to serve the 
persons that expect your service, to their maximum satisfaction. For the service you 
give them you will get the ability to fulfill the duties in return of the rights you are 
entitled to enjoy.  

The society will appreciate and give due recognition to your occupation by 
providing maximum service to the society. Determine to give more to the society 
than what you get from the society.

Environmental Problems and 
Sustainable Development

According to the information available so far about the planets that exist 
in the universe, the most unique planet is the earth. Keeping the Sun as its head, 
its  location  and  the  geological  and  biological  evolution  has  created  a  living 
environment.  The  biosphere  consists  of  an  atmosphere  which  is  formed  by  the 
amalgamation  of  atmosphere,  hydrosphere  and  lithosphere  and  it  has  created  a 
conducive environment for the plants and animals in the biosphere.

In  recent  times  the  concept  of  environment  has  attracted  the  attention  of 
human society as it has been subjected to various changes mainly due to its effect on 
the human society. Even though, previously, man has maintained interrelationships 
with environment they did not influence so much because the environment could 
bear  those  changes.  Therefore,  in  order  to  get  a  proper  understanding  of  the 
environment it is quite important to understand the real meaning of the environment, 
its components and its extent.

Interpretations and views on Environment

 We are part of the earth and it is part of us.

 The perfumed flowers are our sisters.

 The bear, the deer, the great eagle, these are our brothers.

 The rocky crests, the dew in the meadow, the body heat of

 the pony, and man all belong to the same family.

“The Environment is a blend of external states which influence the existence 
of living beings.”

Garen Johns - Dictionary of Environmental Science – 1990

‘The  Environment  is  the  physical,  chemical  and  biological  states  that  exist 
around a living being.”

- Dictionary of Environment

“The  environment  of  a  person  is  his  surroundings.  In  the  same  manner  the 
environment of a plant or an animal also consists of the things that can be found 
around it.

- Man and the Environment -1998

According to this, environment is a mixture of living and non living things. 
Accordingly all the animals including humans, plants, living and non living things 
belong to the environment. All of them have complex and diverse inter relationships 
between each other. The existence and processes occur by their inter relationships.

Components which form the environment

Nonliving (Non-biological) Components

This  includes  atmosphere,  hydrosphere,  and  lithosphere. The  atmosphere 
includes the air on earth, the lithosphere consists of the crust and the outer mantle 
and  the  hydrosphere  includes  the  ocean  and  freshwater.  All  these  components 
interrelate with plants and other living beings in various ways. Many physical and 
chemical factors that affect living systems can be seen in these main components.  
For example, solar radiation, temperature, rainfall, salinity, acidity and bases (PH 
value), etc.

Living (biological) Components

Living  components  consist  of  all  the  animals  including  man,  plants 
and  micro  -  organisms. The  process  that  produces  food  essential  for  the  living 
components produced using the energy of the sun is known as primary production. 

Social Environment

Social  environment  is  a  part  of  non  physical  environment.  Multi  ethnic 
status, religion, castes, heritages, customs, rights, duties, responsibilities, cultures 
are  included  in  the  physical  setting  of  the  social  environment.  This  has  been 
developed with the intervention of man.

Environment is the surrounding that we live in. Ancient Greeks refered to 
the environment as Oikos. They point out that the surroundings that one lives in 
consist of  all the living beings, the interrelationship that exists among them and the 
physical, chemical and biological operations that contribute to its existence.

Fundamental study of the earth environment reveals that it can be classified 
as man made environment and social environment. This can be analyzed in another 
way as physical environment, biological environment and human environment.

Natural Environment

Natural environment is composed of living and non-living components. 
These  things  function  as  natural  systems  without  human  influence.  It  consists 
of all the plants, animals, rocks, soil, water, air, weather, energy, radiation and 
electricity as well as natural phenomena that occurs within them.

Balanced combination of these environmental systems is important for 
the  existence  of  not  only  the  human  species  but  also  for  the  existence  of  the 
entire world.

The environment and man

Man  is  a  part  of  nature.  Man  is  an  internal  part  of  environment.  Man  is 
the main component of the living environment which is formed from the physical 
environment. Therefore, his existence will be established within the environment 
itself.  Man  tends  to  change  the  environment  using  his  thinking  power  and  his 
attempt to put this power into practice in the practical world. The result of this is 
his temptation to change the nature rapidly and this change caused greater influence

Thus protecting nature is important.

Services obtained from the environment

Life support Services

This includes eternal services like sun light, air, water that we get from the 

environment. These services are essential for the existence of living beings.

Economic Support Services

This  consists  of  raw  materials  and  energy  essential  for  human  existence. 
Economic support services consist of land, mineral resources, chemical elements, 
timber, plants and animal foods and drinks, etc., as raw materials where as solar 
energy, fossil fuel, bio gas, geothermal heat hydroelectricity, wind power as energy 
Man has made a greater influence on the environment in these sections in order to 
satisfy his needs.

Waste material absorption services

This is important as a sublime service that we get from the environment. 
The  waste  matter  collected  in  the  environment  through  various  activities  of 
the  animal  world  and  through  human  economic  activities  is  absorbed  by  the 
environment. However, this ability of the environment is lost when the waste matter 
in  the  environment  gets  collected  at  an  intolerable  level.  Then  the  environment 
responds  unfavourably. Accordingly,  environment  is  an  essential  component  for 
human existence and man cannot survive without the environment. Therefore, it is 
important for man to maintain his economic activities as part of the environment 
without affecting it.

Man’s attempt to change the environment

In the human civilization ancient man had limited capacity to change the 
environment. He was capable of changing the environment while living in it so that 
the environment could forebear such changes. Simplicity of man and modest life 
style were the primary reasons for this. But modern man has been able to use the 
knowledge, technical and skill proficiency that he possesses to obtain the resources 

86

For free distribution

For free distribution

87

 
 
 
 
that he requires and utilizes them for his own benefit. Man has pioneered among 
other living beings that exist on the earth and he possesses 0.5% of the whole mass 
of life on earth. Even though this number is comparatively small its effect on earth 
is great.

With the evolution of the Homo Sapiens, the human environment has been 
expanding qualitatively and quantitatively into the physical environment and the 
biological  environment  causing  greater  influence  on  them. At  the  beginning  the 
influence  caused  on  the  environment  was  quantitatively  smaller  and  hence  the 
natural environment was able to absorb them easily. Therefore it did not influence 
the balance of the eco system.

By the mid 20th century, population on earth increased greatly. In the same 
manner the human resource expanded as a result of qualitative development of living 
conditions. With the change of the environment, natural balance of certain places on 
earth was subject to change. As a result of this even the balance of the earth, too, was 
subjected to change. In 2012 the world population reached 7 billion even surpassing 
the  forecast  rate  of  growth.    When  performing  his  economic  activities  man  has 
used  natural  resources,  mineral  resources,  etc,  unlimitedly.  Due  to  this,  physical 
environment is utilized unlimitedly for changes that occur on the natural system 
of the environment based on the changes that occur in the human environmental 
systems,  specially,  colonization  agricultural-industrialization,  industrialization, 
urbanization infrastructure facilities and other service requirements. Through the 
intensification  of  the  changes  that 
take  place  on  the  surface  of  the 
earth,  many  grave  environmental 
effects  or  environmental  problems 
and disasters take place.

Environmental Problems

All sorts of destructive conditions make the beautiful earth surface ugly. Its 
effect can be shown as environmental problems. This is caused by both natural and 
human activities. Breakdown of the ecological balance caused by this dual action 
can be considered as environmental problems. Problems created by natural causes 
affect for a short period of time and stabilizes due to the influence of the biological 
and  physical  environmental  factors.  But  changes  that  take  place  in  the  physical 
environment caused by human action do not stabilize within a short period of time. 
This has become unbearable.

Environmental  problems  of  the  Earth  can  be  identified  in  terms  of 
environmental  problems  related  to  hydrosphere,  atmosphere,  lithosphere  and 
biosphere. 

Social influences that take place due to environmental problems

Many  environmental  problems    are  caused  by  the  over  utilization  of 
environmental resources in an unorganized manner in order to satisfy human needs. 
Many  countries  of  the  world  suffer  due  to  this  fact.  Food  and  nutritional  problems, 
diseases and health problems, destruction of life and property due to disasters, social 
and economic degradation, etc., pose serious threat to the wellbeing of the society.

Over  consumption  of  resources  can  be  noticed  as  the  main  cause  for 
environmental  problems.  Developed  countries  utilize  relatively  higher  level 
of  resource  consumption.  As  a  result  of  this,  developing  countries  are  affected 
unfavourably and are  severly  affected by many environmental problems. The main 
reason for this is the fact that resources of the developing countries are directed 
towards  fulfilling  the  needs  of  the  developed  countries.  For  example,  higher 
percentage of natural and mineral resources found in African, South American, and 
Asian continents are used for the requirements of developing countries. Due to this 
fact the resources are depleted rapidly as they tend to limitless mining and quarrying 
of  resources  for  selling  them.  Poverty  of  these  countries  have  been  increased  as 
they do not have a fair price for the resources. Due to their poverty, destruction of 
forests, unsophisticated mining and quarrying and unprotected use of the resources 
have intensified these problems.

Accordingly,  environmental  problems  have  intensified  social  disparities 
further and because of that they have been subject to many environmental and 
social influences.

Damage  caused  to  the  physical  environment  through  natural 
phenomena

      Environmental problems are created by the phenomena that affect the natural 
balance  of  the  earth  sphere.  As  examples,  earth  quakes,  landslides,  volcanoes, 
wild fire, glaziers, floods, droughts, whirlwinds, tsunami can be taken.

Through  the  environmental  problems  created  by  these  natural  incidents 
short term disasters take place. A storm damages the natural environment as well as 
property and when the effect of the storm diminishes its effect also ends. Here the 
affected trees and plants recover or adapt within a very short period of time. But 
destroyed property has to be reconstructed.

Environmental problems created by human 

As  a  result  of  human  activities  on  the  natural  environmental  systems 
environmental  changes  occur  subsequently  creating  many  grave  environmental 
problems. Bad effects of these changes have given rise to many severe problems 
such as global warming, severe changes in the weather patterns, pollution of bio 
diversity, pollution of air and water, loss of soil fertility, occurrence of acid rains, 
depletion  of  the  ozone  layer,  desertification,  saltification,  spreading  diseases, 
melting glaziers and rising sea level. Actually, even though all these are treated as 
environmental problems they can also be shown as problems of the human species. 
The causes of environmental problems are discussed below.

Water Pollution

The specific feature of water is that it can dissolve many substances easily. 
Therefore  water  gets  easily  polluted.  During  the  past  125  years  due  to  human 
activities water was polluted rapidly. Water is polluted as a result of increasing 
population,  improper  disposal  of  human  excretion  in  an  unhygienic  manner, 
releasing  harmful  materials  through  industrial  waste,  destruction  of  forests, 
agricultural activities, etc., because of this reason 24% of world population have 
lost the right to protected water.

Clean water

Clean  water  means  water  without  acidity  or  alkaline.  Ph.  value  of  pure 
water is 7.0. Pure water cannot be seen in the natural environment because it 
becomes acidic by contacting with carbon dioxide found in the air.

Water pollution is the change of natural quality of water or else the change 

in physical, chemical and biological characteristics of water.

Causes of water pollution

 ² By industries

As  examples  paper,  paint,  garments,  tanning  leather,  mineral  oil,  rubber, 

food industry, and iron and steel industry can be identified.

Damages caused to the lithosphere and human influences related 
to them

      Many resources essential for human needs are obtained from the lithosphere. 
Lithosphere is the earth’s outer covering of hard rocks. This consists of rocks, minerals 
and soil. This part is utilized by man for all sorts  of his economic activities. Iron ore, 
aluminum, titanium, manganese, lead, copper, tin, platinum, uranium, mercury are 
included in this. Man uses these materials for his industrial requirements. As these 
minerals are spread unequally they are owned only by few countries.

Fig. 4.16 Iron ore mining

Fig 4.17 Coal mining

Fig. 4.18  Mining

Since  these  mineral  resources  are  spread  not  only  on  the  surface  of  the 
earth but it is also found in the interior of the earth it causes much damage to the 
Lithosphere.

Fig. 4.19 Influences and damages caused by mining

 
These  mineral  resources  are  exhaustible  resources  because  it  takes  a 
long  span  of  time  for  the  formation  of  them.  Therefore,  they  should  be  utilized 
economically. Mining should be carried out by causing minimum damage to the 
lithosphere.

Influences of the damage caused to the lithosphere

 ² Destruction of natural beauty

 ² Degradation of soil

 ² Formation of marginal lands

 ² Flooding

Different threats have been posed to the environmental types of  system due 

to the land utilization

Removal of forest cover in this manner for agricultural activities

Out  of  the  144.8  million  km2  total  land  area  of  the  earth  only  11%  can 
be  cultivated.  Much  of  the  land  area  remains  unsuitable  for  human  dwelling 
and for economic activities. Already a large amount of land area is cleared for 
cultivation. The main reasons for the removal of this forest cover are preparation of 
agricultural lands, fulfillment of energy requirements, timber trade, colonization, 
and  construction  of  industries,  mining,  construction  of  roads,  development 
projects, and construction of artificial reservoirs. As examples depletion of forest 
resource :  85% the in Ivory Coast, 68% in Congo Forests, 95% in Bangladesh 
and 78% in Sri Lanka Forests have been destroyed.

Use of chemicals in agricultural activities

Since  Green  Revolution  with  the  modernization  of  agricultural  activities 

which increased the harvest, the use of chemical fertilizer, insecticides, weedicides 

has given rise to various problems. It changed the local environmental conditions and 

polluted water. Accordingly, many strategies introduced under Green Revolution 

have contributed to pollute the environment. By 2010, 40% of the responsibility 

for  global  warming  rests  on  these  influences. As  a  result  of  this  23%  of  fertile 
land has been deteriorated. (Source: Management of Environmental Resources and 

Sustainable Development – H.A. Danapala)

Disposal of indecomposable waste matter on land

With  the  technological  development  of  man  plastics  and  other  artificial 

materials,  electronic  goods  and  instruments  are  produced  with  the  resources 

available  in  the  environment  by  changing  their  characteristics.  They  reach  the 

market competitively in different shapes. Within a very short period of time they 

become outdated and are converted into waste. All these matter cannot be easily 

decomposed through the natural process. The rate of production of these goods is 

higher than the rate of destroying them and as a result they are added to the physical 

environment as excess matter. This has become an obstacle to the environmental 

process and the outcome of it is the pollution of land, water and air. They are very 

difficult to be recycled.

Deposition of industrial waste

In  the  process  of  producing  goods  and  services  by  man  industrial  waste 
is disposed as a byproduct of mineral fuel, remains of minerals, iron and noniron 
remains, etc.

A  part  of  this  waste  matter  can  be  recycled  where  as  many  cannot  be 
recycled. This has created many problems. The highly critical one out of them is the 
deposition of nuclear waste. Many problems have been created due to the inclusion 
of radioactive material in them.

Air Pollution

Changes that take place in the composition of atmosphere can be defined as 
air pollution. Human activities have been the main cause of it. This disaster began 
as a result of the new inventions of the Industrial Revolution and Green Revolution. 
Particularly this was started when man began to use fossil fuel as an energy source. 
Other than this, sectors such as industrial, agricultural, transport and deforestation 
have contributed to air pollution.

Effects of air pollution on climatic conditions

The  natural  greenhouse  cover  has  been  severely  changed  due  to  the 
manmade greenhouse gases produced and released to the atmosphere as a result 
of  modernization  that  took  place  in  agricultural,  industrial  and  transport  sectors. 
The increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in this manner has caused global 
warming. From Industrial Revolution, burning of fossil fuel and  deforestation has 
contributed to increase the concentration of hydrogen to 26%. Due to activities like

Effects on the biological environment and the social environment

Human  activities  have  contributed  to  remove  biological  resources 
from  their  natural  habitats  or  eliminate  them.  Through  these  natural  processes, 
nonliving  components  have  greatly  affected  plant  and  animal  population. As  an 
example forests, wet lands, bio diversity, oceanic resources including coral reefs 
have been affected by this. A large number of plants and animal population have 
been  included  in  the  Red  Data  book  due  to  this  reason. Accordingly,  while  the 
biological environment directly contributes to the existence of social environment 
the breakdown of its balance also causes the decline of the social environment.

Effects of damaging the biological environment

 ² Collapse of the balance of biological environment

 ² Destruction of endemic plants and animal communities

 ² Collapse of the functions of the bio systems  such as oxygen cycle, carbon

Effects on the social environment

When  human  activities  become  complex  even  the  social  environment 
becomes  complicated.  Complex  activities  of  man  have  even  caused  social 
diversity. Accordingly, role conflicts, functions related to environmental conflicts, 
socio cultural and moral decline, collapse of family institutions, role of the family 
becoming  complex,  changes  in  social  institutions,  globalization,  changes  in 
economic  patterns,  technical  modernization,  etc.,  have  influenced  almost  all  the 
societies in the world.

Effects of the damage done to social environment

It is obvious that all the animal and plant species including human living 
on earth have no existence without the environment. Therefore, it is important to 
protect the qualitative and quantitative aspects of environment. Government should 
follow environmental protection and conservation strategies. Measures that could 
be taken for this are given below.

Development

Qualitative improvements in the living conditions of man can be defined simply 
as development. At the beginning, the concept of development was considered to be 
the economic growth and identified it as an increase in the Gross Domestic Product. 
However, the concept of development gives priority to raise the living conditions of 
a country, improvement of welfare services and economic progress.

Evolution of the concept of development

As the modern concept of development is a concept originated in the Western 
World  it  is  very  important  to  pay  attention  to  several  definitions  put  forward  by 
academics in order to get a thorough understanding of it.

at the beginning tended towards economic development but subsequently it favours 
the qualitative development in life.It further expands in to a broad concept to include 
changes that take place in traditions, cultures and moral values. Subsequently, it 
included concepts like human rights, democracy, politics, nature of institutions and

Three components are used to prepare this index. 

 Literacy

 Life expectancy at birth

 Infant Mortality Rate

This index takes values from 0 – 100. This index helps to understand social, 

cultural, educational, nutritional and health aspects of a country.

By this index the nature of social development can be measured. Therefore, 
the real nature of the development can be identified through this. This is used as a 
supplement to the Per Capita Income.

Human Development Index

This  is  a  relative  measurement  which  is  used  for  measuring  human 
development.The  progress  achieved  by  a  country  in  social  and  economic 
components can be measured using this index. It represents human development as 
higher, medium and lower levels.

This  is  a  composite  index  which  measures  the  three  aspects  of  human 
development,  namely,  healthy  living,  level  of  knowledge  and  living  conditions. 
Following components were used at the beginning for the preparation of this index.

 ² Life expectancy at birth

 ² Education

 ² Per Capita Income adjusted by the purchasing power

But  at  present  a  wider  concept  of  education  is  used  instead  of  literacy. 
Using this index countries are categorized as very high, moderate and lower level 
of human development.

The Concept of Sustainable Development

The greatest challenge in the concept of development is the fulfillment of 
human necessities which expand with the increase in population. More resources 

114

For free distribution

For free distribution

115

 
have to be used to fulfill needs of the increasing population. The environment has to 
bear a huge cost resulted by the increase in production and inputs. The environment 
is put into great risk due to the fact that in the process of development man has 
completely forgotten the environment as he pay greater attention to fulfill his needs 
and requirements.

Due to the reasons like excessive mining of resources, moving to alternative 
resources as a result of the scarcity of resources, increase of waste matter disposed 
to the environment, intensification of environmental pollution, etc., we have to face 
marginal states such as damaging the bio diversity, obstruction of natural process, 
intensification of natural disasters and increase in global warming.

Even though the concept of development has upgraded the quality of human 
life through economic development it is revealed that as a whole it has not been 
able to bring fairness to the world community. Majority of the world population 
suffers from poverty while destruction and deterioration of the quality of natural 
resources are taking place. As a result of this, a greater number of people are subject 
to unfavourable physical health conditions.

In this manner, changes that cannot be borne by the physical environmental 
systems  should  not  be  brought  about  for  the  sake  of  the  quality  of  human 
development.  The  interactions  between  man  and  the  environment  should  not 
be  disregarded  and  we  should  not  leave  room  for  the  destruction  of  resources. 
It  is  important  to  pay  attention  to  prevent  depletion  of  rare  and  exhaustible 
(non-renewable)  resources.  We  should  also  utilize  these  resources  with  proper 
management. Accordingly, man should enter into the development concept in a 
fair manner that safeguards the existence of the future man in the globe despite 
the development attempts.

Sustainable development is maintaining the process of development in 
a higher level that meets the needs of the present without compromising 
the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

Evolution of the concept of Sustainable Development

The initiative for the concept of sustainable development was taken with 
the establishment of the World Environmental Commission in 1983 with the former 
Prime Minister of Norway Gro Harlem Brundtland as its President. The report by 
the name “Our Common Future” which was published by this Commission argued 
that  the  “Environment  and  Development”  should  be  integrated.  Accordingly, 
sustainable development is defined as “the development that meets the needs of the 
present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own 
needs”. It proposed to achieve those goals nationally as well as internationally. This 
concept has been formally accepted worldwide and the International Conference 
on Environment and Development held in July 1992 at Riode Janeiro paid more 
attention  to  environmental  problems. At  this  conference  the  agenda  for  the  21st 
century was globally accepted. All the nations were expected to carry out strategies 
endorsed  for  the  Sustainable  Development  and  to  fulfill  all  their  tasks  and 
responsibilities.

The United Nations held Millennium Conference in year 2000 and when 
formulating millennium objectives priority was given to objectives of sustainable 
development. Progress of the Millennium Objectives of the world was evaluated 
in  2005.  Tewnty  years  after  the  first  conference,  in  2012,  a  World  Conference 
was held again in Riode Janeiro. It was held “for the renewal of our commitment 
for  a  lasting  development  of  our  planet  and  to  ensure  an  economically,  socially 
and  environmentally  established  future  for  the  present  and  future  generations”. 
Accordingly, it is quite essential not to deviate from the determinations arrived at 
this conference.

In this manner the United Nations Conference (Rio + 20) determined that it 
is quite essential to improve lasting development further by uniting all the sectors 
in its different perspectives including economic, social and environmental sectors 
and  by  accepting  their  interrelationships.  Hence,  it  is  admirable  that  the  world 
community have paid attention to this concept on policy and legal basis.

Necessity of Sustainable Development

In the fulfillment of human needs and wants under Sustainable Development, 
irrespeetive of considering only economic needs,  attention should be paid to both 
social and environmental development fulfilling human needs and wants.

In the development process it is quite important to be sensitive to the needs 
of  the  environment.  The  social  cost  of  the  damage  caused  to  the  environment 
and the loss of natural resources in the process of human development should be 

118

assessed. Since the economic activities which are carried out with the expectation 
of profit making, affect the entire world population there should be restrictions. It is 
important to set restrictions on harmful things produced on profit expectation. The 
balance  of  social,  economic  and  environmental  development  should  be  brought 
about  by  carrying  out  environmental  assessments  on  large  scale  mining  and 
construction  activities,  industries  and  agricultural  activities  which  cause  damage 
to the environment. Therefore, if we are going to have a pure world for our future 
generation we should utilize resources without exploiting them. The great Indian 
poet  Kalidasa  in  his  text  “Kumara  Sambhawa”  stated  that  the  earth  should  be 
utilized in the manner of milking a cow and not by exploitation. Therefore, what 
is  expected  by  Sustainable  Development  is  the  development  in  that  sense.  It  is, 
therefore, important to pay attention to the Millennium Goals on Environment and 
Development.

Measures that should be taken to achieve Sustainable Development

At present many countries in the world have realized the importance of the 
concept of Sustainable Development. Accordingly, agreements have been reached 
to guarantee an economically, socially and environmentally Sustainable future not 
only for our planet but for the future generation as well. Thus it is important to pay 
attention to Millennium Goals on Sustainable Development.

Main  factor  that  determines  development  is  the  availability  of  resources. 
It  is  easier  to  achieve  Sustainable  Development  by  increasing  productivity  and 
efficiency of the resources. Here the 3R concept is important as a main approach 
that can be utilized.

The  duty  and  responsibility  of  different 
organizations about Sustainable Development

institutions  and 

The  entire  economic  process  of  a  country  is  directed  and  managed  by 
the  state  or  government  sector  and  the  private  sector.  In  all  these  activities  it  is 
quite  important  to  pay  greater  attention  to  the  importance  of  the  environment.
Particularly, these institutions should be bound to be sensitive to the damage caused 
to the environment, monitoring and searching about them, collecting accurate data, 
informing, and raising awareness of the relevant institutions and sections. Awareness 
should be raised about the importance of sustainable development through various 
media.  Especially  development  of  environmental  friendly  attitudes,  thinking, 
behaviour patterns and simple way of living should be established in the education 
process.

The duty and responsibility of the government about Sustainable 
Development

The  rulers  should  possess  the  guidance  and  dedication  necessary  for  the 
accomplishment of the concept of Sustainable Development in the State policies 
and  vision.  Here  it  is  quite  important  to  adopt  a  national  policy  on  Sustainable 
Development. Through this the rulers should be responsible for strengthening state 
institutions, raising awareness among them and directing them towards Sustainable 
Development. All these awareness raising activities should be carried out by the 
officers  of  state  and  state  institutions.  Further,  they  should  be  involved  in  the 
enforcement of National Environmental Acts through the relevant institutions and 
mediation in the administration of justice properly. From time to time important 
policy  decisions  should  be  taken  considering  the  environmental needs  locally as 
well as at national level. 

Poverty of the people can be regarded as a major reason for the destruction of 
the environmental resources. As a result of this, environmental resources are misused 
and  exploited  in  an  unauthorized  manner.  Measures  to  alleviate  poverty  must  be 
followed in order to prevent this. Steps should be taken to minimize the imbalance 
that  prevails  in  production,  distribution  and  consumption  of  a  country.  Investors 
should be encouraged towards environmental friendly production and services.

Definitions on International Relations

 I. International Relations mean all types of relations that exist among nations.

II. State level relationships are maintained by officers authorized by the state.            

Accordingly, international relations mean the relationship that exist between 
two  or  more  countries  or,  if  not  between  states  or  international  organizations  or 
between states and persons. You can easily understand this idea by looking at the 
following illustration.

Importance of International Relations

Mutual relationships that exist between two or more states or else between 
states and organizations or if not between states and persons are identified as 
international relations. These relationships can prevail between states and states 
and also between states and various organizations, or between states and other 
organizations  or  with  persons.  Let’s  now  look  at  the  reasons  for  maintaining 
relationships of this form.

They are,

 1. Obtaining something which the country by itself cannot fulfil. 

As stated above, isolation that prevailed among countries disappeared due 
to factors like the increasing rate of growth of the population and the complexity 
of human needs. As a result, no country is able to satisfy all their needs by the 
resources existing in their own countries. Since resources available in countries 
differed  from  one  country  to  another  goods  and  services  produced  by  using 
those resources also differed. Hence, the world community realized the fact that 
development  of  internatiional  relationship  is  beneficial  for  a  country  to  sell  its 
excess production and also to obtain the goods that are scarce in that country.

 2. Ability to expand relationships on political, economic, cultural and social grounds.

Almost  all  the  countries  in  the  world,  differ  more  or  less  on  political, 
economic,  cultural  and  social  grounds.  There  are  favourable  as  well  as 
unfavourable effects of this but international relations are important in order to 
develop favourable effects further. How does this support favourable effects? As 
an  example,  India  and  Sri  Lanka  had  developed  international  relations  several 
thousands of years ago.

In the same manner, many countries in the world develop relations based on 
political, economic, cultural and social factors. The relations that had developed in 
the past in this way have been developing gradually up to now and we can see that 
it helped to develop mutual friendships among countries.

 3. Protection from the influences exerted by powerful countries

Modern  countries  in  the  world  have  become  powerful  on  the  basis  of 
factors  like  economic  and  military  powers.  Specially,  economically  strong  and 
militarily powerful countries put pressure on relatively less powerful countries 
in  various  ways.  This  situation  developed  after  these  countries  were  liberated 
from Colonialism. Powerful countries put pressure on them politically by means               
of  giving  loans  and  aids,  providing  weapons  and  other  military  assistance  in 
civil wars. Development of international relations of less powerful countries to 
a certain extent helped to protect themselves from threats posed on them by the 
powerful countries. If that does not happen less powerful countries may become 
a victim of powerful countries in the international community. 

4. Prevention of obstacles caused by protectionist policies

We can observe now that many countries of the world follow protectionist 
policies, in their economic activities, for example, purchasing of garment on the basis 
of quotas, imposition of a guaranteed price through various agreements can be stated.

Activity 5.1

 ² Define international relations briefly and explain the importance of it.

Main aspects of maintaining international relations

You know that international relations are the relationships that take place 
between countries in almost every field such as political, social, and cultural spheres. 
By now you have also studied the importance of maintaining those relations.

Next, it is important to pay attention to the main aspects of international relations. 

We can identify two main aspects of maintaining international relations. They are:

1. State strategic relations

2. Military strategic relations

126

For free distribution

For free distribution

127

 
 
 
 
    
 
1. State strategic relations

Peaceful  relationships  maintained  by  countries  among  themselves  can  be 
identified as state strategic relations. Diplomatic relations developed at official levels 
through ambassadors and state emissaries can be considered as state strategic relations. 
These state strategic relations are directed by government foreign policy. The foreign 
policy  of  a  government  shows  with  whom  the  country  should  maintain  strategic 
relations and how it should be carried out. Especially strategic state relations are 
established through international conferences, bilateral meetings of leaders of the 
states, specially through foreign missions and foreign ministers.

2. Military strategic relations

Relationships build up on defence matters can be considered as military 
strategic  relations.  Especially  a  country  builds  up  military  or  defence  relations 
with another country or countries when its security is threatened militarily. For 
example we can show the military bases established during the First and Second 
World Wars.

Through military strategic relations military training and specialist support, 
supply  of  military  weapons,  use  of  military  forces  and  humanitarian  assistance 
(like  providing    medicine)  take  place.  Military  strategic  relations  are  important 
particularly  in    maintaining  balance  of  power  among  states.  This  will  reduce 
tendency of one country or several countries becoming a threat to other countries 
by expanding military power.

Different spheres in which international relations are developed

Even though international relations prevailed in the past it was confined to a 
greater extent to a few spheres. Particularly, we can identify that these relations have 
been generated on the basis of trade and cultural factors. For example, the relations 
that existed between Sri Lanka and India were based  on cultural factors. Relationship 
between India and Arabia were based on trade. However, we can identify that these 
relations at present have spread to various other spheres. Accordingly, we can show 
that diplomatic relations now prevail on the basis of areas like technical relations and 
educational relations.

With  the  development  in  the  field  of  science  and  technology  and  the 
revolution that is taking place in the fields of communication and transportation, the 
world has become a global village. In modern science, specially in the construction 
of high speed aeroplanes and supersonic jets and also development in road systems 
international  relations  have  contributed  a  lot.  International  relations  have    been 
developed very fast as a result of improvement in facilities like reading books and 
journals through the internet (E-Library). These developments in various  fields of 
technology have made the global village very much closer today.

Fig 5.2 - High-speed Rail

Factors that contributed to the development of international                     
relations

By  now  you  have  realized  very  well  the  spheres  in  which  international 
relations have been developed. Accordingly, it is worth to consider the factors that 
have influenced the growth of international relations.

 ² Resource disparity or the differences in the availability of resources in each   

country.

Example : fossil fuel is abundant in Middle East countries while it is not   
available in many other countries in the world.

 ²

Inability of a country to produce all its needs within the country itself.

Example : Importing wheat flour and sugar by Sri Lanka

One of the main problems a country faces today is its inability to produce 
all  the  goods  and  services  necessary  for  the  people  of  the  country  within  itself. 
Therefore, since a country always has to depend on another country it has to build 
up relations internationally.

 ² Sale of excess production 

When the goods and services are produced using resources available abundently 
in a country they may exceed the requirements of that country. International relations 
develop when that country sells the excess production to another country for which 
those goods are scarce.

 ² Development in transport and communication  

Transportation  and  communication  are  too  spheres  in  which  rapid 
developments are taking place at present. As a result, world has become a global 
village. Specially, due to easy access to travelling facilities and also fast flow of 
information, international relations have been developing very fast.

 ² Necessity of obtaining advanced technological knowledge   

Many  countries  in  the  world  have  benefited  from  the  development  of 
science and technology but these developments did not reach other countries in the 
same speed. As a consequence of this a gap was created between developed countries 
and less developed countries. In comparison to the development of technology in the 
developed countries the level of development in less developed countries remains 
at a minimum level. Due to this fact, there was a scarcity of advanced technological 
skills in these countries. As a result less developed countries are required to obtain 
new  technological  discoveries,  instruments,  specialist  support  and  knowledge, 
from developing countries.

 ² Obtaining support in emergencies and other disaster situations    

A country has to obtain help and support from another country in emergency 
situations.  Tsunami,  whirlwinds,  tornados,  floods,  landslides,  volcanoes  and  similar 
natural  disasters  are  a  few  exampes  of  such  situations.  In  such  situations  countries 
come forward to provide humanitarian assistance only if they have built up positive 
international relations.

 ² Development of political, economic, social and cultural relations    

International  relations  are  important  in  developing  various  political 
ideologies,  economic  policies,  social  and  cultural  relationships  followed  by 
countries. While friendship among these countries are improved through this they 
volunteer to provide support services like foreign aids, loans and supply of various 
equipments  essential  for  social  development.  Not  only  motivation  necessary  to 
acheive  the  optimum  level  politically  but  guidance  is  also    provided.  In  certain 
occasions representation of the country internationally on behalf of certain political 
rights  and ideologies also takes place. This factor has a greater impact on developing 
international relations.

Present aspect of international relations

It seems that in the past international relations were maintained in order to 
satisfy a limited number of objectives but now international relations are formed with 
the intention of achieving various aims and objectives.

In recent times it is possible to identify how the powerful countries influence  
less powerful countries. It is a significant fact that powerful countries pose pressure 
not only economically, politically and by military force but also technologically on 
less powerful countries.

With the fall of Power Base Ideology after the World War II, an environment 
was  created  for  all  the  countries  to  maintain  a  neutral  foreign  policy.  It  can  be 
noticed  that  powerful  countries  attempt  in  various  ways  to  influence  the  less 
powerful  countries  even  in  such  a  background.  Some  such  influencing  areas  are 
given below.

 ²

International Trade

 ² Offering loans and aids

 ² Economic development

 ² Defense spheres

 ² Provision of employments

Next  we  will  examine  how  Sri  Lanka  is  influenced  by  the  international 

community on the above grounds.

The influence of international relations on Sri Lanka

When we look at the present status of international relations we can see the 
aspect that powerful countries put pressure on weaker countries. These influences can 
be identified under the spheres such as economic, political, military spheres.

Particularly, the influences put on Sri Lanka do not take uniform outlook. The 
nature of the pressure put on Sri Lanka by the world community changes with the 
nature of the government in power. However, here the influences caused on Sri Lanka 
in relation to the following grounds are discussed.

International Trade

As a low price prevails in the world market for the primary goods exported 
from Sri Lanka its import income remains at a minimum level. As some developed 
countries purchase some products of Sri Lanka and re-export them we lose a large 
sum of money that our country should get.

Because of this Sri Lanka has taken steps to get a stable price for the exports 
by forming various trade agreements with the international community. In the same 
way, agreements with regard to exporting garments have been signed in order to 
supply garments to American buyers.

However,  since  some  trade  agreements  have  been  abolished  during  the  past 
period a certain amount of pressure is put on Sri Lanka through the international trade.

Example:- GSP+ concession

Provision of loans and grants

Provision  of  Loans  and  aids  to  Sri  Lanka  by  the  donor  countries  put  
great pressure on Sri Lanka. As an example, we can show that in issuing loans 
and aids various conditions are imposed on Sr Lanka by the donor countries. 
These conditions are imposed not only by the powerful countries but by various 
international financial institutions as well.

As  examples  World  Bank,  International  Monetary  Fund  can  be  stated. 

Some such conditions are given below.

130

 ² Employment of the loan or aid on the nominated project only

 ² A short duration of time is given for interest payment and repayment of the loan.

 ² Physical/human resources of the donor country are utilized in the relevant   
  project.

Economic sphere

In handling its economic activities Sri Lanka faces severe problems during 
certain  periods  of  time.  Particularly,  the  abolishing  of  the  apparel  quota  system, 
rising prices of fuel oil are significant among them. In such situations Sri Lanka has 
to make a greater effort to maintain stability of the economy. Specially obtaining 
loans and aids, issuing of treasury bonds, raising bank interest rates are some of 
them. In such situations the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and Government Treasury 
perform a commendable service. 

National Security

A  country  has  to  make  a  great  effort  to  maintain  its  national  security. 
Specially, during the time of civil war Sri Lanka made a greater effort for its 
national  security.  Here  advanced  technical  knowledge  and  military  equipments 
have to be obtained from developed countries. Maintenance of national security is 
challenged when weapons are supplied unofficially to terrorist groups; weapons are 
sold  to  the  country  at  higher  prices  and  even  when  those  countries  avoid  giving 
military specialist knowledge to the country. National security should be established 
internally as well as externally. Therefore the three military forces and the police 
should be kept alert.

Provision of employments

Middle  East  and  South  Korea  enjoy  an  important  place  in  creating  a  job 
market for Sri Lanka. It generates a large sum of foreign exchange for the country 
and make a great contribution to the economy of Sri Lanka.

However, in obtaining the labourers for the job market some countries 
pose a greater influence on Sri Lanka by placing restriction on the number of jobs 
supplied,  imposing  minimum  qualifications  for  the  jobs,  imposing  conditions 

132

133

 
 
 
 
on the remittances of their earnings as well as torture and ill treatment on the 
labourers. Yet many countries have built up the job market under very friendly 
relationships.

Regional Organizations

When we discuss about international organizations we should pay attention 
to  another  sub  category  of  international  organizations  operating at regional level. 
These organizations are formed based on geographical regions that can be seen in the 
world. For example, we can identify several such organizations by studying the world 
map given below.

Further  we  can  also  identify  the  existence  of  sub  regions  within  these 
geographical regions. As an example we can state the existence of South Asian 
sub geographical region within the Asian geographical region. We can see how regional 
organizations  are  established  within  such  sub  regions.  These  organizations  are  also 
recognized by the common name as Regional Organizations.

When we pay attention to how regional organizations are formed we see 

that they have been established on two main objectives. They are,

 ² Regional organizations based on military objectives

 ² Regional Organizations based on economic cooperation

Next we will discuss about regional organizations established on military 

objectives.

After the World War II many countries in the world were unified around two 
main power bases. Those are, power base headed by United States of America and 
the other is the power base headed by the Soviet Union.

Based  on  these  two  power  bases  regional  organizations  were  formed 
on  military  objectives.  Accordingly,  the  first  regional  military  organization 
established was the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The main reason 
for the establishment of NATO was to establish the collective security of the West 
European countries.

Subsequently, Warsaw Treaty Organization was established by the countries 
headed  by  Soviet  Union  for  the  protection  of  the  East  European  countries.  The 

132

133

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
main reason for the establishment of Warsaw Treaty Organization was to retaliate 
any invasions posed by the NATO organization. However, with the fall of the East 
European Bloc headed by Soviet Union, the Warsaw Treaty Organization, too, was 
abolished and now only NATO operates.

In recent times, in World Politics, we can see a trend of establishing 
regional organizations based on economic objectives. Particularly, formation 
of  state  organizations  based  on  these  objectives  was  originated  in  Europe  for  the 
first time. The European Economic Community formed in 1957 was the first regional 
organization established for the purpose of economic cooperation. After that, European 
Union and Latin American Free Trade Association were formed.

In the Asian Region ASEAN or Association of South East Asian Nations was 
established in 1967. Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum was established in 
1989. South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC) was established 
in 1985 by the South Asian countries on economic and social activities of the region. 
Next we will study about SAARC organization.

SAARC Organization

The organization which was established by the Countries belonging to South 
Asian  Region  is  identified  as  SAARC  organization  or  South Asian Association  for 
Regional Co-operation. This organization was established for the economic cooperation 
of the countries in the South Asian region. There are 8 countries which belong to the 
SAARC organization. Given below is the map showing those countries.

India

 ² Sri Lanka

Except Afghanistan  the  other  countries  got  the  membership  at  the  time  of  its 
establishment.  Afghanistan  which  is  the  latest  member  of  the  organization 
obtained the membership recently.

The  leaders  of  the  member  countries  put  their  signature  to  the  SAARC 
Charter on the 08th of December 1985 at Dhaka in Bangladesh. The Charter was 
signed in Dhaka in Bangladesh in memory of the former Bangladesh leader Ziaur 
Rahman  who  was  assassinated  while  he  was  taking  initiatives  to  establish  this 
organization.

Given below is the official logo of the SAARC organization. It symbolizes 

the cooperation of the member countries.

Objectives of the SAARC Organization

 ² Promoting the welfare of the people of South Asia and to improve their    
  quality of life.

 ² Accelerate economic growth, social progress and cultural development in    

the region.

 ² Provide all individuals the opportunity to live in dignity and to realize their  

full potential.

 ² Promote and strengthen collective self-reliance among the countries of  
  South Asia.

 ² Contribute to mutual trust, understanding and appreciation of problems of    
  one another.

 ² Promote active collaboration and mutual assistance in the economic, social, 

cultural, technical and scientific fields.

 ² Strengthen cooperation with other developing countries.

 ² Strengthen cooperation among themselves in international forums on matters  
  of common interest.

Functions of the SAARC Organization

SAARC Charter states that the Heads of State or Government shall meet 
once a year or more often as and when considered necessary by the Member States. 
The  highest  committee  of  this 
organization  is  the  Meeting  of 
Heads  of  States.  Other  than  that 
there are the Council of Ministers 
and  the  Standing  Committee  of 
Foreign Secretaries. The SAARC 
Secretariat which coordinates and 
monitors  the  implementation  of 
SAARC activities was established 
in Kathmandu.

Present status of the SAARC Organization

When  we  compare 
with  the  other  international 
and  regional  organizations 
we  cannot  see  any  strong 
the 
relationships 
among 
the 
member  countries  of 
SAARC  Organization. 
It 
is  quite    essential  for  any 
country  to  take  measures  for 
the  promotion  of  sectors  like 
agricultural 
development, 
exports, cultural activities, sports, health activities, welfare facilities. Main reason for 
this is that all the SAARC countries are developing countries. In the same manner 
internal  political  conflicts  and  also  war  situations  are  common  problems  faced  by 
many of the member countries. It has become quite essential for the member countries 
to make extra effort to control the drug menace and terrorist groups.

Fig 5.7 - SAARC Summit

The  member  states  should  take  steps  to  create  a  free  market  among  the 
member  countries,  connect  with  the  modern  world  through  the  exchange  of 
technological  knowledge,  improve  tourism,  taking  steps  for  the  protection  of 
environmental sustainability.

In the same way it is essential to prepare programme of work to minimize natural 
disasters in order to fulfill the development targets. It is also important to pay attention to 
prepare a specific economic policy in order to protect from various influences posed by 
the western countries.

International Organizations

It is essential for us, as members of the society, to have the help and support 
of others and their cooperation in order to maintain our day to day activities. In the 
same manner it is essential for the countries of the world to get help and support as 
well as cooperation of other countries in their various activities for the fulfillment of 
their various needs and requirements. As a result of this, several countries get together 
and reach agreements through the formation of conventions in order to fulfill their 
requirements and this can be regarded as the origin of international organizations.

There  are  a  large  number  of  international  organizations  in  the  world. 
Through them each and every country gets mutual support and benefits. Specially, 
the United Nations Organization (United Nations) fulfills a great service to every 
member country. Here you will get the opportunity of understanding the functions 
of the United Nations and its affiliated institutions as well as several other regional 
organizations.

The United Nations (UN)

With the end of the Second World War, the United Nations Organization was 
established in order to prevent the occurrence of another World War because a large 
number of human lives were destroyed, a large number of people were disabled and 
became  handicapped.  Inestimable  amount  of  property  was  destroyed  in  this  war. 
Therefore,  the  world  leaders  paid  attention  to  prevent  countries  going  into  such  a 
destructive state of   another war again.  The United States of America, Great Britain 
and  Soviet  Russia,  and  other  leading  countries  of  the  time  took  the  initiative. As 
a result of this in 1945, a conference was held in the city of San Francisco in the

word  “British”  was  dropped  and  was  identified  by  the  name  “Commonwealth”. 
In 1911 Great Britain held a Conference called Empire Conference to discuss the 
common problems faced by countries which belong to its Empire. Subsequently, in 
1944 the Common Wealth was established with the membership of countries which 
were former colonies of the British Empire.

However, the Durham Commission Report of 1839 influenced the birth 
of the Common Wealth. It is not necessary for all the former colonies which 
obtained  independence  to  get  the  membership  of  the  Commonwealth.  The 
leader of the Common Wealth is the King or Queen of Britain.

Media of international relations

Countries of the world maintain relations in various ways. Specially, through 
peaceful  relationships  as  well  as  warfare  relationships  international  relations  are 
built up.

International  community  performing  within  peaceful  relations  is  highly    
favourable. Then it develops mutual trust and corporation and it leads to minimize  
conflicts.

Next  we  will  consider  several  main  media  through  which  international 

relations are maintained.

1. Diplomatic Service

The  main  media  through  which  international  relations  are  maintained 
peacefully  is  Diplomatic  service.  The  role  played  by  the  diplomatic  service  in 
developing international relations is great. While maintaining the foreign policy 
strongly international objectives are fulfilled through the diplomatic service.

A  country  may  build  up  official  relationships  with  another  country  and 
also with organizations and persons through the diplomatic service. Here the state 
carries out its foreign policies through diplomats and state missions or emissaries.

The ambassadors of countries that belong to the Commonwealth is called 
as  the  High  Commissioner.  For  example,  the  Indian  Embassy  in  Sri  Lanka  is 
identified as the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka.

The functions of the Ambassadors and the Emissaries

 ²

Implement the foreign policy of the country

 ² Safeguard the expectations of the citizens of his country

 ² Deliver the messages of one’s own country to other countries

 ² Understand the policies of one’s own country

 ² Create a good image about one’s own country

 ²

Improve friendship among countries

 ² Represent one’s own country and the leader of one’s own country

The qualities of the Ambassadors and the Emissaries

 ² Act with proper understanding of one’s profession, rules and regulations, 

strategies and ethics.

 ² Have proper understanding about one’s own country as well as the country  

that one serves in and the nature of the world politics.

 ² Knowledge about state strategies, Arbitration, Conciliation and Negotiation.

 ² Utilize international rules and regulations and international political trends for  

the benefit of one’s own country.

2. International Trade

We  have  discussed  that  no  country  in  the  world  can  produce  all  the 
things that country needs within that country itself. As a result import and export 
activities take place among countries.

For  example,  Sri  Lanka  exports  tea  while  the  United  States  of America                   

exports wheat flour.

International Trade takes place in two ways. 

1.Bilateral Trade

2.Multilateral Trade

Bilateral Trade means the transactions take place between two countries 
only. As an example, Sri Lanka exports rubber to China while China exports rice 
to Sri Lanka. When carrying out bilateral trade the two countries have to come to             
agreements between them.

Multilateral Trade

The trade that takes place among more than two countries is called Multilateral 
Trade. The specific feature that can be seen in Multilateral Trade is, the value of the 

152

goods imported from one country to another can be settled with the value of the 
goods exported to that country. Assume that Sri Lanka imports milk powder from 
New Zealand and exports garments to USA.

       Sri Lanka           

 Export

Garments

 USA

 Sri Lanka 

Import

Milk Powder

    New Zealand

In the above transaction the amount that should be paid to New Zealand for 
the import of milk powder can be instructed to be paid with the income from the 
USA for the Garments exported to that country. In that situation New Zealand can 
import another good or service from the USA for that value.

Powerful Currencies used in international Trade

- American Dollars

- Sterling Pound

- Euro

- Japan Yen

International Organizations associated with International Trade

- The European Free Trade Association

- UNCTAD Organization

- GATT Organization

- International Monetary Fund

Activity 5.2

 ² Select two international organizations associated with internatinal trade 
and  arrange  the  information  under  the  headings  such  as  membership, 
objectives, etc.

War

War  can  be  considered  as  a  another  way  that  international  relations  are 
maintained. This is not a peaceful media of maintaining international relations. A 
conflicting situation that arises between two or more parties can simply be identified 
as  war.  (This  has  been  greatly  discussed  in  Chapter  V  of  Grade  10  Citizenship 
Education Text Book). The best example for war situation between countries can 
be stated as the two World Wars. Armed struggle that prevailed in Sri Lanka can be 
stated as a civil war which took place within a country.

Due to war, international relations are threatened. Refugees are a result of 
wars.  International  relations  can  be  damaged  due  to  people  migrating  from  one 
country to another as refugees. However, some countries voluntarily allow refugees 
to enter their territories.

It  is  also  necessary  to  obtain  donations  and  aid  for  the  restoration  of                    
property and other resources destroyed by war. If this does not happen countries 
affected by war would become helpless.

Strengthening of international relations is essential in order to establish 
and maintain national security. It is quite indispensible for countries which are 
subjected to internal and external risks of war to seek International Cooperation 
for their national security.

Foreign Aid

Existence of strong international relations is essential for the provision of 
foreign  aid. Aid  is  given  by  the  developed  countries  as  well  as  those  countries 
which are in a position to provide aid. As an example, the assistance provided by 
India for the Northern Region railway line development projects can be stated.

Foreign  aid  is  given  to  developing  countries  for  the  improvement  of             
areas  such  as  large  scale  heavy  industries,  development  of  infrastructure 
facilities, welfare services and other economic sections.

Activity 5.3

 ² Select three countries and three organizations which provide foreign aid. 
List separately how each of these countries and organizations performed 
their services to Sri Lanka.

Peace

Prevalence of peace in a country brings happiness to all. Peace is essential 
not only for the protection of human rights but also for the progress of economic, 
social,  cultural,  political  aspects  of  a  country. All  the  citizens  should  work  with 
responsibility for the maintenance of peace in the country. Peace can be developed 
if we work without being divided on any narrow communal, religious basis or any 
other grounds. Such a situation does not give way to conflict. The United Nations 
which was formed for the purpose of creating world peace renders a great service 
for the protection of peace.

Development

When  peace  is  established  in  a  country  development  takes  place 
automatically. A country which does not experience peace have to spend a large 
amount of money to maintain the armed forces of the country, to purchase weapons, 

156

157

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to  look  after    refugees,  persons  dying  at  war  or  the  disabled  and  to  reconstruct 
the  destroyed    property.  Since  a  large  amount  of  the  National  Income  is  spent 
on the   areas mentioned above, the amount of money that is allocated for other     
development work takes a minimum value. As a result of this, the development of 
the country is hampered by it or will completely break down.

Therefore, a country in which peace prevails, the money spent on war can 
be utilized to achieve development targets. Then economic and social development  
accelerates. New job opportunities are generated. Purchasing power of the people 
increases.  A  quality  living  condition  is  created.  It  generates  new  investment 
opportunities and the entire economy becomes strong.

Effects of building up international relations

Following benefits can be achieved by building up international relations.

 ² Develops international friendship. Due to this all the states follow a friendship  

policy. Give help and support in emergency situations.

 ² New job opportunities are created.

 ² Mutual help is given in emergency situations.

 ² New technological knowledge can be exchanged.

 ² Support will be given on development activities.
