of  career  opportunities  are  liable  to  change  specifically  in  the  near  future.  In  such  an 
environment,  with  a  new  technological  and  intellectual  society,  thousands  of  innovative  career 
opportunities would be created. To win those challenges, it is the responsibility of  the Sri Lankan 
Government and myself, as the Minister of Education, to empower you all.  

This book is a product of free education. Your aim must be to use this book properly and 
acquire  the  necessary  knowledge  out  of  it.  The  government  in  turn  is  able  to  provide  free 
textbooks to you, as a result of the commitment and labour of your parents and elders. 

Since we have understood that the education is crucial in deciding the future of a country, 
the  government  has  taken  steps  to  change  curriculum  to  suit  the  rapid  changes  of  the 
technological  world.  Hence,  you  have  to  dedicate  yourselves  to  become  productive  citizens.  I 
believe that the knowledge this book provides will suffice your aim.  

It  is  your  duty  to  give  a  proper  value  to  the  money  spent  by  the  government  on  your 
education.  Also  you  should  understand  that  education  determines  your  future.  Make  sure  that 
you reach the optimum social stratum through education.

Foreword

The educational objectives of the contemporary world are becoming more complex 
along  with  the  economic,  social,  cultural  and  technological  development.  The 
learning  and  teaching  process  too  is  changing  in  relation  to  human  experiences, 
technological  differences,  research  and  new  indices.  Therefore,  it  is  required  to 
produce  the  textbook  by  including  subject  related  information  according  to  the 
objectives in the syllabus in order to maintain the teaching process by organizing 
learning experiences that suit to the learner needs. The textbook  is  not  merely a 
learning  tool  for  the  learner.  It  is  a  blessing  that  contributes  to  obtain  a  higher 
education along with a development of conduct and attitudes, to develop values and 
to obtain learning experiences.

The government in its realization of the concept of free education has offered you 
all the textbooks from grades 1-11. I would like to remind you that you should make 
the maximum use of these textbooks and protect them well. I sincerely hope that 
this textbook would assist you to obtain the expertise to become a virtuous citizen 
with a complete personality who would be a valuable asset to the country.

I would like to bestow my sincere thanks on the members of the editorial and writer 
boards as well as on the staff of the Educational Publications Department who have 
strived to offer this textbook to you.

Are there any computers 
to suit the requirements 
of both of us?

Computer shop

Yes. Many types are available. 
We can either buy a computer or 
we can get a computer assembled 
to suit our requirements. Let’s go 
in and take a look around!

1.1

Identifying the user 

The one who uses a computer is generally referred to as a user. Different 
users working in different areas in Information and Communication Technologies 
have different designations. The following table shows a few such examples;

 Figure 1.1 : Some examples for user requirements

A computer to suit user requirements can be selected from those available in 
the market (Figure 1.2), or a computer can be assembled to suit user requirements. 
Computers can be classified according to their nature and use as follows; 

•  Non - portable computers

Server  computers,  workstations,  desktop  computers  and  all-in-one 
computers,  are  all  operated  using  the  main  electricity  power  supply.  These 
computers are large in size and relatively heavy. Therefore, they are installed and 
used in places like houses, schools or offices. 

•  Computers for mobile use 

Laptops, notebooks, tablet computers and a smart phones can be considered 
for mobile use. They operated with re-chargeable batteries. Therefore, they can be 
used when traveling in buses, trains, aeroplanes or from any convenient place.

Computer peripheral devices

What are peripheral devices? 

Input devices are used to feed data and instructions into a computer. Storage 
devices are used to store data. Output devices are used to provide the information 
processed with the input data. Accordingly, input, storage and output devices are 
called peripheral devices. 

Optical disk

Microphone

Monitor/ Display

Printer

Hard disk

Computer specifications

What are computer specifications?

Before purchasing an item, it is important to be aware of the value and the 
quality of the item. Specifications are generally about the common features of an 
item. 

For example, length, width and paper thickness, etc. determine quality of an 

exercise book. Basic specifications for an exercise book are as shown. 

Basic specifications for an exercise book 

    : 210 mm
    : 148 mm

Length    
Width 
Number of pages     : 40
Thickness of paper   : 60 GSM
Type  

    : Single ruled 

Similar to the specification of a book, a computer also has its specification.

Specifications to suit different user requirements

Consider a situation where two students use two types of books for different 
purposes. For example, a square ruled exercise book for mathematics and a large 
size drawing book for art. Specifications for the two types mentioned above are as 
follows: 

Specifications for an exercise book 

Specifications for a drawing book

Length 
Width 
Number of pages 
Thickness of paper  : 60 GSM
Type      

: 210 mm
: 148 mm
: 200

  : Square ruled 

: 300 mm
        : 210 mm

Length 
Width  
Number of pages    : 20
Thickness of paper    : 70 GSM
Type   

        : Blank

Different specifications for different purposes may result in price differences 

as well. 

The  specifications  change  according  to  user  requirements  in  the  above 
example.  Similarly  depending  on  the  use  of  a  computer  its  specifications  also 
differs.

1.5

Specifications of computers and peripheral 
devices 

The following shows some important factors of computer specifications;

Important  -  One  can  generally  assure  the  quality  of  an  item 
through its specifications.

1.5.1 The processor 

Humans  are  considered  the  most  intelligent 
among all living beings. The brain (Figure 1.4) helps 
man to make decisions for actions taken. The brain 
also has the ability to swiftly respond to all sensations. 

Figure 1.4 : the human brain

Much  as  the  brain  is  most  important  for  humans,  the  processor  (Central 
Processing  Unit)  (Figure  1.5)  is  the  most  important  part  of  a  computer.  The 
processor processes data swiftly. As such, the processor is considered the "Brain" 
of the computer. 

The side that connects to the mother 
board

View from above

Figure. 1.5 : Central Processing Unit

Speed of the processor 

A machine functions at a slower speed takes a longer time to complete a 
task while a machine functions at a higher speed takes a shorter or a lesser time 
to complete a task. Therefore, the amounts of work that could be carried out using 
these machines during a unit time differs.

 Blender working at slower speed

For free distribution

 
 
 
Figure  1.6  shows  two  blenders  working  simultaneously.  The  blender 
working at higher speed processes a larger quantity of fruit juice per unit time. A 
machine working at a higher speed provides better results.

The performance of a computer depends on the speed of the processor. A 
processor running at high speed is able to process more data during a unit time. 
That is, the performance of the computer is increases. Then the software can be run 
faster. Therefore, when selecting a processor, it is advisable to select one with a 
greater speed. 

The  speed  of  the  processor  is  measured  by  the  number  of  instructions 

executed per second. 

Important  -  The  speed  of  a  computer  is  determined  by  the 
number of instructions execute per second. 

The speed is measured in Hertz (units such as MHz or GHz).

1000 MHz = 1 GHz

Processor manufacturers

Several  processor  manufacturing 
Intel  and  AMD 

companies,  Apple, 
(Advanced Micro Devices) exists.

Types of processors

Figure 1.7 : Different processors

Generally, the number of processors  in a central processing unit is used to 
classify the Central Processing Unit. The following table shows examples of some 
Intel Central Processing Units with multiple processor units.

Refer to workbook for Activity 1.3.

1.5.2 Hard disk

The  hard  disk  provides  permanent  storage  space  for  storing  data  and  to 
installing  all  software.  The  hard  disk  is  the  main  secondary  storage  device  in  a 
computer.

For example, an exercise book with 160 pages provide more writing space 
than a book with 40 pages. Similarly, more data can be stored in a hard disk with a 
greater storage capacity. (see figure 1.8).

1.5.3 The monitor display

The main output device of a computer is its monitor display. Most often, a 

user interacts with a computer via its monitor/ display.

Monitor size

For examples, a wall clock is larger than a wrist watch. Time is easily seen on 

a wall clock because of its size. Similarly, larger monitors have better visibility.

A larger monitor size is useful in viewing a larger picture. The monitor size 

is measured in terms of its diagonal length in inches. (Figure 1.9).

19 inch

Figure. 1.9 : Monitor Size

Monitor technology

Monitors  can  be  classified  into  the  following  types  according  to  the 

technology used by them:

 ² CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) Monitor
 ² LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) Monitor
 ² LED (Light Emitting Diode) Monitor

Fig.1.10 : CRT and LCD /LED monitor

CRT monitors consume more electricity than the other two types. Further 
they are heavier and occupy more space due to its size. Hence, light weight LED 
and LCD monitors which consume less electricity are commonly used today. (See 
figure 1.10).

1.5.4

Main memory

Let us consider a shelf which is used to keep books and bags when entering 
a library (See figure 1.11). Students who enter the library keep their school bags in 
compartments. They takes their bags as they leave the library. 

In a similar manners data and instructions are stored temporarily in the main 
memory (See figure 1.12) when the computer functions. A bigger rack for storage 
in  a  library  can  hold  more  school  bags.  Similarly,  a  higher  capacity  in  the  main 
memory  stores  more  data  and  instructions.  Therefore,  a  computer  with  a  higher 
main memory capacity is better.

Important  - The  capacity  of  the  main  memory  is  measured  in 
units of bits. (Mega Bite (MB) or Giga Bite (GB) etc).

1024 MB = 1 GB

Refer to workbook for activity 1.5.

1.5.5 Video Graphic Adapter (VGA)

The  Monitor  is  the  main  output 
device  of  a  computer.  The  output  is  fed  to  
the  monitor  via  the Video  Graphic Adapter 
(VGA).  There  are  two  types  of  Video 
Graphic  Adapter  (VGAs).  On  board  VGA  
is  fixed  to  the  mother  board  and  Separate 
VGAs  card  can  be  fixed  to  mother  board 
manually.  The  separate  VGA  card  has  a 
separate video memory and a processor. Separate VGA cards are useful for playing 
computer games.

Figure 1.13 : VGA card

Modern  computers  use  DV1  or  HDMI  ports  instead  of  VGA  port  (See  Figure 
1.14).

Figure 1.14 : Types of video ports

When  HDMI  cables  are  connected  to  a  computer,  a  television  screen  or 
multi media projector, both sound and video signals are transmitted. When a VGA 
is used for the same purpose, only images are transmitted and a separate cable is 
required for sound.

1.5.6 Sound cards

Many  computer  are  widely  used  for  entertainment  today. A  sound  card  is 
required for listening to music and recording audio. A microphone connected to the 
sound card can be used to record (input) sounds while a speaker connected to the 
sound card can be used to play (output) sounds.

Most computers have the sound card built into the motherboard (See figure 

1.15). A user can also connect external sound card to the computer if necessary.

1.5.7 Pre-Installed software

An  operating  system  provides  the  interface  between  the  user  and  the 
hardware. The operating system is essential to run application software. Once the 
operating system is installed in a computer, the necessary application software can

obtained free of charge. Licensed operating systems such as Windows 8, Windows 
10  to  purchase. A  trial  version  of  an  operating  systems  such  as  trail  version  of 
Windows 10 can be used only for a limited period. Required application software 
depends on the requirement of the user. 

In buying a desktop computer or a laptop computer it is important to check 
whether an operating system has been pre-installed. Most often only DOS or LINUX 
computer systems are pre-installed. A computer with licensed software installed is 
more expensive than a computer with a free and open source operating system.

Non-technical features to be considered in 
purchasing a computer

Non-technical specifications such as manufacturer, type of book and price 
are considered in purchasing an exercise book. This applies to the purchase of a 
computer as well. Therefore, in purchasing a computer, non-technical specification 
must also be considered.

1.6.1

Warranty 

Warranty  is  an  important  factor  to  be  considered  when  purchasing  a 
computer. Warranty given by the vendor and the manufacturer assurers to cover the 
defects for a certain period. Customer can get this warranty in many different ways.

a. Manufacturer warranty

The  warranty  which  is  given  by  the  manufacturing 
company  is  known  as  the  manufacturer  warranty.  If  the  device 
malfunctions  during  the  warranty  period,  it  is  either  repaired  or 
replaced with a new one.

b. Extended warranty

Extended  warranty  is  a  prolonged  warranty  given  to 
customers in addition to the standard warranty. Customer needs 
bearing additional cost for extended warranty.

c. On-site warranty

If  a  customer  obtains  an  on-site  warranty,  technicians 
from the respective company visit the place of work to repair the 
product. They generally maintain, replace faulty parts and examine 
the operations of the machine. 

There is a standard warranty when purchasing a computer. 
but, the warranty for the parts of the computer may differ from the 
standard.  

For  instance,  a  laptop  computer  with  standard  warranty  for  3  years,  may 

have only one year warranty for the battery.

1.6.2

Price

The price of a computer can vary according to the customer requirements.  

e.g.

1.  The price of a computer is rather high with a high speed processor.

2.  A computer with a large monitor is comparatively high in price.

3.  Price is low of a computer with a lesser memory capacity.

4.  A computer inclusive high capacity hard disk drive is high in price.

It is advisable to compare prices to suit one’s requirements from different 

places and select the computer with the lowest price.

Refer to workbook for Activities 1.6 and 1.7

Important - It is not advisable to purchase a computer considering 
only its price.

1.6.3 Services after-sale

Computer sales centers provide the following after-sales services to customers;

1. Technical advice

2. Technical assistance

3. Telephone, e-mail and website information (i.e. contact information) of the 
    vendor

It is advisable for a user to consider the given information in purchasing a 
computer.  Customer  needs  preparing  specifications  first. Then,  a  computer  must 
be  bought  from  a  vendor  with  a  reputed  name  and  must  be  from  a  recognized 
manufacturer.

How can I ?

There are enough software 
available to develop computer 
games. You will get a chance 
to improve your knowledge 
while having the opportunity 
for playing.

3.1

Simple selection

You learnt in programming chapter of Grade 
8, ICT textbook that a simple selection is selecting 
one option out of two given options under a certain 
condition.  For  example,  one  such  choice  is  the 
selection of “head” or “tail” with the toss of a coin. 

Head and tail of a coin

Start

Toss the coin

Is it head?

No

Show it is 'tails'

End

Yes 

Show it is 
'head'

Simple selection has one condition with two options. A selection is made 
out of the two conditions. If the condition is true, one option is selected and if not, 
the other option gets selected.

Refer to workbook for Activity 3.1.

3.2

Selection out of many options

Selection out of many options is about selecting one out of more than two 

options.

Example   Tossing a dice for values of 1 to 6

Start

Toss the dice

Get the value

Is value 1?

No

Is value 2?  

No

Is value 3?

In  the  above,  a  number  will  be  displayed  if  one  of  the  five  conditions  is 

satisfied or if non of the five conditions is satisfied.

3.3

Control structure with repetition 

Repetition  is  about  an  action  getting 

repeated again and again.

With  repetition,  both  beginning  and 

end is based on a condition.

Example 1   Displaying numbers 1 - 5

Begin

Number = 1

Is the 
number 5 or 
less than 5? 

Yes 
Show number

No

End

Add 1 to number

   Flowchart 3 : Display numbers 1 - 5

In  this  flowchart  the  condition 
is,  “Is  the  number  equals  5  or 
less than 5”?

At  the  beginning,  condition  is 
checked and since the condition 
is  true,  the  repetitive  work 
commences.

Once the number is shown, 1 is 
added to it and the condition is 
checked again. 

When the number exceeds five, 
condition  is  not  satisfied  and 
the repetition ends.

Programming with arrays

What is an array?  

In  Grade  7,  we  learnt  that  to  store  values  in  programming,  variables  are 
needed. We need a number of variables that is equivalent to the number of values to 
be stored. 

For example, consider storing marks gained by a student for five question 

papers on general knowledge.

Five variables are required to store marks for the five question papers. 

Name the variable as marks _ 1, marks _ 2, marks _ 3. marks _ 4 and marks 
_ 5. Marks earned by a student can be stored in these variables. Consider 78, 85, 69, 
93, 87 to be the marks scored. 

78

85

69

93

87

marks_1

marks_2

marks_3

marks_4

marks_5

Each variable needs giving a name when variables are used to store values. 
This is difficult when a large number of variables are used. Further, the program 
become complicated and large with large number of variables. In such instances, 
arrays are used to get over this problem.  

An array is a data structure that can store any number of items using a single 
variable name. By using arrays, programs become less complex and the number of 
instructions can be reduced.

Building up arrays

Lists are used for arrays in Scratch. Lists can be built as follows in Scratch. 

e.g. - Using arrays to enter names of animals:

1.  Select ‘Make a List’ from data

2.  Give array a name

3.  Select ‘For this sprite only’

4.  Click 'OK'

Assigning items into arrays

For example, after building an array named 'Country' to enter the names of 

five countries, the following code can be used to enter items to it.

 Scratch program 13

Displaying items in an array

After entering data into an array named ‘Country’, the following program 

can be used to display its content to produce the output.

Scratch program 14

In the above program, v_con is a variable and ''Country'' is the name of the array.

Let us consider an example where two Scratch programs to store the names 
and the marks of five students are processed. The first one uses multiple variables 
whereas the second one uses two arrays.

With the arrays in use, it is possible to use a repetition construct. This helps reduce 
the size of the program.  

Note - An array is termed a list in Scratch programming.

Let us consider another example;

A  school  conducted  a  competition  to  select  students  for  a  general  knowledge 
contest. The principal decided to select students who gained over 15 marks for the 
interview.

Five students are to face the interview. In the code shown below, using two arrays 
named 'Name' and 'Marks' the names of students having marks greater than 75 are 
shown.

Summary

 ² Repetition is about repeating a statement or a set of statements.
 ² A condition is necessary to begin and end a repetition.
 ² There are Scratch repetition control structures.
 ² There are three repetition control structures in Scratch:

i.  Control structure for repetition a set number of  

times (e.g. for 10 times)

ii.  Control  structure  for  repetition  based  on  a  

condition

iii.  Control structure for endless repetition

 ² Repetition  within  a  repetition  is  called  a  nested 

repetition.

 ² There are a few nested repetition types:

i  Repetition to satisfy a given condition

ii.  Continuous repetition a fixed number of times

iii.  Continuous  repetition 

to  satisfy  a  given 

condition

 ² An array is a data structure to store many items using a single name.
 ² Dividing  a  problem  into  smaller  selections  makes  problem  development 

easier.

Identifying devices that use sensors
Introducing the control of processing and output of data collected from 
sensors and developing codes for the purpose.

Microcontrollers

The sun is up. Yet, the 
street lights are on.
Isn’t it a crime to waste 
electricity?

True. We can minimize the 
loss. To do so, we could use 
a light sensor to detect sun 
rise and sun set and based 
on that the lights could be 
automatically switched on 
and off. 

I haven’t heard of 
such light sensors. 
How are they 
controlled?

For free distribution

47

 
There are sensors to measure 
things like soil conditions, 
temperature and environmental 
conditions and many such. 
Specialized computer programs 
could be used to control them. 

Use of sensors to identify environmental changes

To  use  sensors  to  detect  environmental  conditions  and  to  set  related 

information, they must be connected to a computer.  

The basic functions of a computer are to input or collect data, process data 

according the given instructions and to output necessary information.

Components of microcontroller

A microcontroller consists of four basic components;

1. Central Processing Unit - CPU

    This processes data into information in order to provide the output.

2. Memory

    There are two types; 

i.  Non-volatile memory

The data in the non-volatile memory does not get erased even if 
there is no electricity. The program that the microcontroller should execute 
is stored in it.
       ii. Volatile memory

Data in the volatile memory gets erased if there is no electricity. 
It functions as the Random Access Memory (RAM). This is used to store 
data as well as other results that are related when the microcontroller is at 
work. Data and instructions for the CPU are also held here.

3. System clock

The  system  clock  is  an  electronic  device.  It  synchronizes  all 

components.

4. Peripheral devices

Small pins used to input data or output information belong to this 
category. Data is collected in both in analog and digital forms. Output is 
released in digital form.

Use of sensors and micro controllers

Solar lamp

This  contains  solar  cells,  sensors  and 
microcontroller.  Solar  cells  microcontroller  and 
light sensors cooperate to light the lamp. The solar 
lamp turns on automatically with the dark and turns 
off when there is light. Use of such solar lamps can 
minimize the waste of electricity. 

Washing machine

Pressing buttons, the user gives instructions to 
the microcontroller for the wash. The microcontroller 
operates accordingly.

Microwave oven 

The microcontroller in the microwave oven 
holds  the  heat  for  a  specified  period  and  stops.  
The  user  has  to  instruct  regarding  the  required 
temperature and the duration.

Important: 

Single Board Computer (SBC) 

A single-board computer has a single circuit board with memory, 

input, output and microcontroller. 

e.g. - Raspberry pi

Single Chip Computer (SCC)

Central processing unit, input, output and memory are all built into 

a single integrated circuit. (IC)

Impact of ICT on society

The methods of teaching in our 
class has changed a lot. Today we 
saw a video during the science 
lesson. We also saw some photos 
related to the History lesson on a 
computer. I remember the lesson 
very well. Now, I love learning.

Yes, that is e learning. It is 
teaching using ICT and the 
Internet 

ICT has brought about great 
changes everywhere in every 
field. Use of ICT has helped 
complete tasks more efficient 
and quickly. Let’s look at

Most countries in the world 
are fast developing, aren’t 
they? Do you know the reasons 
for having two kinds of 
countries as the developed and 
developing

Our teacher explained us how 
a society can develop with 
Information Communication 
Technology. Yet, Information 
Communication Technology has not  
yet reached some countries. Some 
countries lag behind.

Digital divide

Some societies in the world have ready access to computers and the Internet  
while some others do not. This gap between those who have and those who have 
not is known as the digital divide.
