Dear Sir,

Complaint against Dumping Garbage in Public Places

I  would  like  to  bring  to  your  attention  a  problem  that  is  faced  by  the 
residents of this area. 
We have noticed that there is a lot of garbage that has been disposed 
around the tank bund for the past few months.The tank bund has been 
a place where many children gather in the evening to play and we have 
worked very hard to keep that area clean. But today, we see that many 
ice-cream cups, food wrappers, and polythene bags have been carelessly 
thrown away all over the area. On rainy days, there is a bad odour in and 
around the area and there is the risk of spread  of diseases.
Please be kind enough to look into this matter as soon as possible.
Thank you.
Yours faithfully,
FJPeris
F.J. Peiris.
