Good morning everybody.

*Madam Principal, dear teachers and friends,
All  of  us  know  that  our  inter-house  netball 
tournaments are commencing next week. So I think 
it’s a good time to tell you something about netball 
to make you aware of the sport.
Netball  is  a  team  game  which  consists  of  seven 
players in each team. It is mainly played by women 
even though there are men’s netball teams in some 
countries. 

144

For free distributionNetball  was  derived  from  basketball.  This  game  originated  in  England  in 
1890s.  Netball  can  be  played  both  as  an  indoor  and  an  outdoor  game.  It  is 
played in a rectangular court with two goal rings at each end. Teams score 
points by shooting the ball through the rings. Each player is assigned positions 
and can hold the ball up to three seconds before passing or shooting a goal. 
A  game  is  played  for  sixty  minutes  and  the  team  which  scores  the  highest 
number of goals wins the game.
It  is  a  popular  game  in  Commonwealth  Countries.  Rules  and  regulations 
of  the  game  and  organizing  international  tournaments  are  handled  by  the 
International Netball Federation.
I know you are looking forward to the tournaments. I am happy to say that 
all preparations have been completed by now. Remember my friends, while 
we all love to win, winning is not everything. Respect the game and play fair.
Let’s enjoy our netball season.

Read these quotes about good sportsmanship. Add your own ideas to them 
and prepare a poster. 

Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence win championships.” 
― Michael Jordan–basketball player

Teamwork is the fuel that allows common people to produce uncommon 
results - Unknown

  Just play, have fun, enjoy the game.
  -Michael Jordan

I think sportsmanship is knowing that it is a game, that we are only as 
good  as  our  opponents,  and  whether  you  win  or  lose,  to  always  give  100 
percent.

 - Sue Wicks –basketball player

One man practising sportsmanship is better than hundred teaching it.
-Knute Rockne –American football player and coach

"The secret of winning football games is working more as a team, less 
as individuals.-Knute Rockne – American football player and coach
