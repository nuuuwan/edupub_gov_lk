1.1  Introduction to a business plan

"  Failing to plan is planning to fail"

The  above  statement  shows  the  importance  of  planning  with  regard  to  success 
in the field of Management. A plan is essential for success in anything. In Grade 
10, you studied how to select a business opportunity through various methods of 
assessment. Now you should prepare to start up and implement your business. In 
fact, drawing up a plan to transform a business idea into a real business is a main 
function of an entrepreneur. This chapter will give you a basic understanding of 
what business plans are.

The following activity will help you check your understanding of business plans.

          Activity 01

Read the given statements and indicate whether they are true (a) or false (r).

No.

Statement

a/ r

01 Every person and organization has certain targets to accomplish.

02 Every business that is started will be successful.

03 The only way to be successful in a business is to put in a lot of 

money. 

04 Business plans should be modified according to the changes in 

05

06

the environment. 
If you want to assess how a business is performing, you need a 
plan. 
In  business  planning,  you  cannot  be  sure  of  the  predictions 
regarding the external environment.

07 As the factors of the environment keep on changing, preparing 

business plans is not necessary.

08 A plan is necessary to succeed in any goal.

Before making a business plan, you should study 
the  business  environment  well.  If  you  prepare 
your business plan that way, it would guide you 
to succeed in your business through using limited 
resources and suitable strategies. If not, you may 
not achieve your goals and the resources could 
be wasted as well.

Figure 1.1 

Your school is an educational institution where various plans are being implemented. 
You would have seen the Year Planner in the main office of your school. It is a plan 
that  includes  the  activities  scheduled  by  your  school  for  the  relevant  year. Your 
class time table is another example for a plan.

A business plan is a formal document that presents, in a structured 
and well-organized manner, the targets you expect to reach and the 
various activities that you will carry out at the start-up of a business 
and while running the business. 

Based on this description, you can verify your answers for the Activity 01. 

1.2  Composition of a business plan

There  are  several  elements  of  a  business  plan.  Out  of  them,  let  us  focus  on  the 
following elements.

Let us take a brief look at each of them.

01. Executive summary

The executive summary is a summary of the entire business plan. It summarizes 
the most important information regarding the business for the benefit of the reader.

When a person reads the executive 
summary,  he/she  should  be  able 
to  create  a  mental  picture  of  the 
business based on the information 
presented  there.  The  executive 
summary  is  usually  about  one 
page in length. 

Figure 1.3

The following information is summarized in an executive summary:

 The name of the business, the industry that it belongs to, etc. (described very briefly)
The name of the business that the entrepreneur wishes to start and information 
regarding the nature of the business.

 A summary of the Marketing plan, highlighting its most important points

bank loan to expand an existing business or to manage the future activities 
in a methodical way through a self-investment should be included.

After the executive summary, the very next page should have a detailed description 
giving general information regarding the business. It will give information about 
the business and its owner or owners.

02.  Marketing plan

This section details how the sales targets will be achieved. The following forecasted 
information has to be included here: the goods or service expected to be sold, the 
demand for the goods or service, marketing strategies, sales expenditure and sales 
income.

03.  Production plan

market. Production plan estimates the cost needs to be incurred when producing 
that quantity of goods or service.

1.3 Need for a business plan

01. To make the business idea clear

A business plan gives details about the proposed goods or service to be
offered and its uniqueness, to the persons who are interested of the business.

02. To understand the business environment

Business environment keeps on changing all 
the time. Changes occur in the internal 
environment of a business, as well as in the 
external environment including economic,  
social, political and technological and the 
natural environment. All of these changes can 
be identified early through business planning. 

03. To guide the business

Figure 1.5

It indicates what activities should be done by each party involved in the 
business.

04. To indicate the future direction of the business

The business plan clarifies what status the business should achieve in future.

05. To raise the necessary funds

Investors prefer to put their money into profitable ventures. A business plan 
displays the proposed activities and expected benefits of the business. A 
business plan is essential for organizations such as banks when making 
investment-related decisions.

06. To make a good estimate of the demand

The market demand is a main factor determining the success or failure of a 
business. It is necessary to be well aware of the competitors and substitutes, as 
well as their market share and strategies; and to form suitable strategies to
face them. All of these require planning.

07. To identify the resources required for the business

today whether your business will be a success or a failure in future. This will 
help you to face future uncertainties successfully.

09. To get an overall image of the business

2.1  Introduction to a marketing plan 

A marketing plan can be identified as the basis of the entire business plan. This is 
because all other parts of a business plan will be prepared based on the information 
of the marketing plan, such as customer needs of the target market and quantity of 
units in demand.

The  marketing  plan  explains  what  goods  or  service  an  entrepreneur  expects  to 
offer, its potential market and the related marketing strategies. It also includes the 
projected sales for the product and the sales expenses to be incurred.

Marketing plan is the document that presents the goods or service that is expected 
to be marketed by an enterprise, its target market, and how the target market will 
be reached.

The following information is included in a marketing plan:

  Market analysis
  Marketing strategies of the proposed business
  Sales forecast
  Sales income and sales expenses
  Marketing Fixed Assets

Let us examine each of them briefly.

2.2  Market analysis

A market analysis refers to exploring the market in relation to the business. It deeply 
investigates the demand for the goods or service, the target customers, the nature of 
the competitors and their marketing strategies, etc. This will help the entrepreneur 
understand  the  factors  that  he/she  should  consider  when  deciding  on  marketing 
strategies for his/her business.

The  main  purpose  of  a  market  analysis  is  to  get  the  necessary  information  to 
prepare an accurate marketing plan. Therefore, a market analysis is the first step of 
preparing a marketing plan.

Obtaining information for a market analysis

Information needed for a market analysis can be gathered through different means. 
Given below are some of the methods used often for this purpose:

 Distributing questionnaires among customers and getting their responses
 Interviewing customers
 Observering customers’ transactions in the market
 Using sources such as newspapers, magazines, reports, internet etc.

Important factors in a market analysis

1. The demand for the goods or service 

What the entrepreneur expects to offer to the market may be something 
that is already available in the market. If not, it could be a modified version 
of something that is already available, or something entirely new. Whatever 
it is, it is necessary to examine the customers’ willingness to buy it as well 
as their ability to buy it.

2. Target customer

This refers to the customers who we can expect to buy the product, or who 
we can expect to be persuaded to buy it in future.

Let us identify the target customer through the following examples:

Goods/ service

Exercise books 
Gold Jewelry  
Preparatory  material  for  Grade  5 
Scholarship examination
Mobile phone repairing
Sports goods

Target customer

School students
Ladies
Students of Grades 4 and 5

Mobile phone users
Sportspersons

An entrepreneur must identify his/her target customer correctly. This can be done in 
a very specific manner by considering factors such as the customer’s age, income 
level, gender, occupation, social status, etc.

3. Competitors

The same kind of goods or services can be offered to the market by many 
different suppliers. The other suppliers who provide goods or services that 
are similar to those that we offer are our competitors. There are many 
varieties of toothpaste, soap, chocolates, telecommunication services, etc 
available on the market under different brand names, and these are examples 
for competitive goods and services.

In addition to such homogeneous products, there can be substitute goods/ services as well.

Given below are some examples for substitute goods/ services.

Goods/ Services

Laundry soap
Butter
Western medicine
Cab services
Tea

Substitute
Laundry powder (washing powder)
Margarine
Ayurvedic medicine
Three wheelers
Coffee

Therefore,  when  studying  competition,  it  is  important  that  you  consider  the 
homogeneous  products  (i.e.  goods  and  services  which  are  similar  to  yours),  as 
well as substitute products. In addition, you should pay attention to the marketing 
strategies used by your competitors. 

           Activity 01

Select  several  goods  and  services  available  in  the  market.  Write  down  some 
homogeneous products and substitute products for each of them.

2.3  Marketing strategies of the proposed business

By  exploring  the  market,  the  entrepreneur  can 
understand  the  marketing  strategies  used  by  the 
competitors.  Then  the  entrepreneur  has  to  select 
strategies  for  his/her  own  business,  so  that  it 
can  face  the  competition  successfully.  Selection 
of  marketing  strategies  should  be  based  on  the 
marketing mix. There are four main variables of 
the marketing mix, which are also known as the 
4 Ps: Product, Price, Place and Promotion. Given 
below is a short description of the 4 Ps. 

Product

Figure 2.1 

Price

Place

Products refer to goods or services offered to the market which can satisfy 
the customer needs or wants. 

This involves information regarding the product such as its content, 
ingredients, shape, quality, size, brand name, instructions for use, etc.

The cost incurred by the customer when obtaining a product is called its 
price. This is a main factor that determines the demand for the goods as well 
as the profit earned by the entrepreneur.

Pricing strategies, how the prices are to be set, any discounts to be given etc 
are considered here.

This refers to how the goods or service will reach the target customer.  
Different strategies can be used to make the goods/service available to 
the customers. For example, the entrepreneur may sell the goods directly to 
the customer, or through retail traders. If not, the entrepreneur can sell the 
goods to the wholesale trader, who sells them to the retail trader, who in turn 
sells them to the customer.

Out of all such strategies, the most suitable one/s should be considered to
make the product available to the customer.

Promotion

Businesses use various strategies to create a demand for their goods 
or services, to increase the existing demand and to attract the customers. 
These strategies are called promotion.

The following are some possible means of promoting a product.

                   Television, radio, newspapers, 
        banners, leaflets, posters

                        Methods involving new technology, 
      such as promotions over Websites, 
      Facebook, etc

                 Using mobile SMS

Figure 2.2

     Meeting the customers in person

                Organizing charity programmes and artistic or cultural events 

As described above, the marketing plan should include the promotional strategies 
for attracting the customers and retaining their loyalty for the product.

2.4  Sales forecast

A  sales  forecast  refers  to  determining  the 
quantity of goods or services to be marketed 
within  a  provided  period  of  time  in  future. 
After analyzing the market, the entrepreneur 
can  understand  the  demand  for  his/her 
product within the target market. There may 
be a large market for the product.

An entrepreneur may not cover the entire market demand at the time of starting up 
the business. Depending on the strength of his/her business, the entrepreneur can 
forecast the unit of sales of the market share.

The demand for a certain product is 15 000 units per week. The 
current competitors provide only 12 000 units. Therefore, there is a 
market gap for 3 000 units. It is the new entrepreneur who should 
decide whether he/she can supply all 3 000 units or only a part of it.

When making a sales forecast, the expected quantity of sales can be calculated per 
day, per week, per month, per trimester, per year, etc. It would facilitate the decision 
making. The forecasted market share should be included in the marketing plan.

Marketing expenses

All  expenses  incurred  in  marketing  the  goods  or  service  are  taken  under  sales 
expenses.

Example :- 

Salaries and wages for Marketing managers and staff

Expenses related to sales outlets (if any), such as rental, maintenance, 
electricity, water, insurance, etc

Office expenses such as telephone charges, stationery, etc

Publicity and promotion-related expenses

Depreciation expenses - based on the lifetime of a fixed asset such 
as sales vehicles, office equipment, a portion of its value should be 
deducted in the form of an expense. This is called depreciation.

As  indicated  above,  the  forecasted  data  regarding  the  total  sales  income  and 
expenditure should be included in the marketing plan. 

2.6  Marketing fixed assets

These  are  the  fixed  assets  that  are  directly  relevant  to  the  sales  and  distribution 
activities of the business. 

Example :- 

Land and buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles, office tools and 
furniture, etc. which are used in sales and distribution-related activities

2.7  Preparing a marketing plan 

To  further  clarify  the  concepts  discussed  above,  let  us  study  a  marketing  plan 
prepared for the following scenario. 

After having considered a number of business ideas, Akila Jayawardene 
finally decided to manufacture yoghurt.

He thought of starting the business targeting his own town, Araliya, in 
Rathnapura. Given below is the information he found from studying the 
market for yoghurt in the area:

Population in Araliya  40 000 citizens

5% of the population eat yoghurt every day. At present, 75% of the yoghurt 
sold in the market is dairy yoghurt and 25% is fruit yoghurt.

Akila  understood  that  50%  of  the  demand  for  yoghurt  in  the  area  was 
fulfilled by external companies and 50% by two local manufacturers.

Therefore he decided to capture 10% of the market share in the first year 
of business. The following strategies were selected.

Product: dairy yoghurt and fruit yoghurt 

Price : competitive market price

Place : selling through retail traders and restaurants, and selling from 
the place of manufacture

Promotion: displaying posters at the outlets, offering stickers for children

A three-wheeler worth Rs. 480 000 will be bought to distribute yoghurt. 

Other expected expenses are given below:

   Annual depreciation of the three-wheeler - Rs. 4 800 

   Annual insurance premium of the three-wheeler - Rs. 4 800

   Monthly fuel and service expenses - Rs. 7 200

   Monthly salary for sales staff – Rs. 10 000 

   Monthly expense for printing posters – Rs. 1 500

   Monthly expense for printing stickers – Rs. 2 000

Distribution of yoghurt will take place five days a week. The market price 
of a cup of yoghurt is Rs. 30. There is no difference in price between dairy 
yoghurt and fruit yoghurt.

           Activity 03

Sasmitha decided to start a business of manufacturing and selling sweets. She 
visited several restaurants in the area to find out about the sweets available 
for sale and the demand for them.

Based on the information given by the restaurant owners, she understood that 
there were many who manufactured sweets using wheat flour. However, there 
were only a few who manufactured sweets out of rice flour and kurakkan flour.

Through a market analysis, she understood that a considerable number of 
people,  being  diabetic,  were  starting  to  use  rice  flour  and  kurakkan  flour. 
Given below is some information that she has collected:

Her hometown, Jayagama in Akuressa, has a population of around 80 000
citizens

20% of the population like food made of kurakkan flour and rice flour

They wish to buy sweets at least once in two days

The main competitors and their market shares are as follows:

‘Vimansi Sweets’ – 30%
‘Arundathi Sweets’ – 35%

The marketing strategies of the competitors –

Ensuring the taste and hygienic quality
Distributing once per two days and having the unsold items returned to them
Displaying sales posters near shops that sell sweets

Sasmitha decided to start up the business covering 25% of the market. She 
will be using the same marketing strategies as her competitors. In addition, 
she decided to circulate flyers giving information about her products.

3.1 Introduction to a production plan

A production plan is another important element in a business plan. A production 
plan is prepared with the aim of calculating the production cost and the cost per one 
unit of the product. 

You have already studied the marketing plan. There, the entrepreneur estimated the 
quantity of goods or services that he/she expects to sell. The next step is estimating 
the cost for producing that quantity of goods or services. This requires a production 
plan.

When producing any good or service, it is necessary to incur a cost. For instance, 
think  of  your  exercise  books. When  producing  exercise  books,  you  will  initially 
need paper, stapler pins and printed covers. You will also need machinery for cutting 
up and binding the books. In addition, you need employees to do all the work.

All  of  these  result  in  some  cost.  When  a  large  quantity  of  goods  or  services  is 
produced, you will need more material and more workers, and the cost will increase 
as  well.  Therefore,  a  proper  production  plan  must  be  prepared,  taking  all  the 
expenses into account.

A production plan is the document estimating the cost for a number of production 
units.

3.2 Production process

Production  process  describes  how  the  goods  or  service  will  be  produced.  This 
includes  details  on  what  kind  of  input  will  be  used,  what  changes  will  be  made 
to the input, and what the final product will be. Here, input refers to the resources 
needed to produce some goods or service.

Let us try to understand the production process through the following example on 
how to make a cup of tea. 

Process of conversion
Put the water in to the kettle and boil

Output 

Wash the utensils

Put milk powder and sugar into the jug and mix well

Put the tea leaves into a jug and add boiled water

Strain  off  the  tea  leaves  to  the  jug  where  the  milk 
powder and sugar and stir well

Strain  the  milk  tea  into  the  cup  which  has  been 
washed

Tea leaves
Milk powder
A teapot

Similarly, there is a production process for any product, indicating the relationship 
between the input and the output. This can be displayed as follows:

Input

3.3 Production fixed assets

Buildings, machinery, equipment etc that are used for long term, again and again in 
the production process are known as production fixed assets.

3.4 Production cost

Production  cost  refers  to  the  total  cost  incurred  for  material,  labour  and  other 
expenses (production overheads) during the production of a product.

Production cost = material + labour + other expenses

Let us look at each of these separately.

Material and  material cost

The  input  used  in  producing  any  good  or  service  is  called  material. The  money 
spent on the material is the material cost. 

In the previous example, water, sugar, tea leaves and milk powder can be 
considered material, and the cost incurred for them is the material cost.

Labour and labour cost

The process of converting input into output requires human labour. A payment must 
be made for labour, and this can be identified as labour cost. These payments are 
called salaries and wages.

Other expenses incurred in production

Apart from the above material and labour costs there are other expenses which are 
incurred  through  the  production  activities.  Such  expenses  can  be  taken  as  other 
expenses incurred in production.  In the previous example, if there were an electric 
bulb lit at the time of making tea, it would also amount to a certain cost. Such general 
expenses are considered under this category. In addition, based on the lifetime of a 
fixed asset, a portion of its value should be deducted in the form of an expense. This 
is called depreciation.

In a manufacturing plant, electricity used for lighting, salary for the security guard, 
insurance coverage for the plant, depreciation of fixed assets etc are examples for 
other expenses.

3.5  Unit cost of production

When the total production cost is divided by the number of units produced, we get 
the production cost of one unit.

              Total production cost

     Unit cost of production  =
                                                          Number of units

3.6 Preparing a production plan

To further clarify the concepts discussed above, let us study the production plan 
prepared for the following case. 

Given below is the estimate on production expenditure for the business owned by 
Maya Randiya. This enterprise manufactures 12 000 cement-and-sand concrete  
bricks per month.

Monthly expenditure estimate 

  Cement – 150 bags (Rs. 900 per bag)
  Sand – 50 cubes (Rs. 6 000 per cube)
  Lubricant oil – 20 liters (Rs. 50 per liter)
  Water expense Rs. 3 000
  Electricity expense Rs. 3 000
  Maintenance Rs. 1 000
  Trained labour – 1 person (Rs. 25 000 per month)

           Untrained labour – 1 person (Rs. 10 000 per month)

  Machinery depreciation Rs. 2 000

4.1 Introduction to an administrative plan

It is difficult for the owner/s of a business to 
run  all  the  business  activities  by  themselves. 
Therefore they need various human resources 
for the business. The administrative plan is the 
document  that  contains  the  information  and 
cost estimates regarding the human resources 
that  a  business  needs.  It  also  describes  the 
functions,  responsibilities  and  authorities  of 
each person involved in the business.

Figure 4.1

The following information is included in an administrative plan

  Administrative positions and functions
  Employee salaries and wages
  Other administrative expenditure
  Administrative fixed assets

Now let us discuss each of these in detail. 

4.2 Administrative positions and functions

A business organization consists of various divisions to handle its different activities 
related to production, marketing, finance, administration, etc. and there are many 
positions that come under each of these divisions. It is the administrative plan that 
gives  information  on  these  positions  in  the  business  organization:  the  functions 
and responsibilities assigned to each position and the qualifications required. An 
organizational chart can be used to indicate the divisions of a business organization 
based on its functions, as well as the various positions in the organization and their 
hierarchy.

Figure  4.2  given  below  shows  the  divisions  of  a  business  organization  based 
on  its  basic  functions.  It  is  an  example  for  an  organizational  chart  showing  the 
administrative positions of an organization.

4.3  Employee salaries and wages

The administrative plan should present an estimate of all the payments that will be 
made to the people holding various positions in the organization. If the owner/s of 
the business also perform some work and they have to be paid for it, those payments 
should also be included in the plan.

4.4  Other administrative expenses

Apart from salaries and wages, if there are any other expenses related to the administrative 
functions of the business, they should be included in the estimate of expenditure. 

The following are some examples for expenses which are related to the administrative 
functions. 

Rental  for  buildings,  telephone  charges,  stationery  expenses,  maintenance  of 
administrative fixed assets repair and depreciation, office electricity charges, postal 
charges, etc.

4.5  Administrative fixed assets

There are fixed assets which are directly related to the administrative functions of a 
business, such as buildings and installations, office equipment, etc. The depreciation 
of these assets should be calculated based on their value and lifetime, and it should 
be indicated as an administrative expense.

4.6 Preparing an administrative plan

To further clarify the concepts discussed above, let us study the administrative plan 
prepared for the following case.

5.1  Introduction to a Financial Plan

You have studied the marketing, production and administrative plans that should 
be included in a business plan from the previous chapters. This chapter explains 
the final and the most important part of a business plan, i.e. the financial plan. The 
forecasted financial requirements and the profitability of the expected business is 
included in the financial plan. 

Further, the money expected to invest in the business, cash inflows and outflows 
and the daily cash requirements of the business are estimated by a financial plan. 
Similarly  this  shows  the  expected  profit  calculated  considering  the  forecasted 
income and expenditure of the business for a specific period.  

Financial plan is useful for an entrepreneur due to following reasons.

 To decide the amount of funds required for the business
 To minimize financial problems 

 To identify the business result (profit/loss) of the business at the end of a 

     specific period

 To assess the adequacy of the above said business result

Information included in a financial plan are given below.

 Activities and expenses prior to starting the business

 An estimation of the total investment

 Statement of expected cash inflows and out flows
 Calculation of expected business results  

Let’s briefly discuss each of these parts.

5.2  Activities and expenses prior to business startup

There are activities to be completed and expenses to be incurred before starting any 
activity. Similarly, before starting a business, certain activities should be done and 
expenses should be borne by the entrepreneur. Some such activities and expenses 
are given below.

Expenses on market survey

One of the main things done before starting a new business is studying the market 
relating to the business. We call this a market survey. Expenses on market survey 
includes  expenses  incurred  to  gather  the  required  data,  to  analyze  them  and  to 
prepare reports relating to the expected business.

Examples :-

Expenses required to study the consumer needs, competitors,
distribution methods of products and service, price for which the
product or the service can be sold 

Expenditure on improving the business premises

The business premises should be arranged to suit the business before starting the 
business activities. Expenses that should be incurred with this regard are known as 
expenditure on improving the place.

Examples :- 
   Installation of electricity, water, internet 
   facility, telephone networks and  
               expenses of land preparation, cleaning 
   and preparing the premises.  

Figure 5.1

Expenditure for searching the raw materials and the equipment

Before starting the business, equipments required to the business should be bought 
and  installed.  Similarly,  if  the  business  is  a  production,  entrepreneur  should 
search  for  the  methods  and  institutions  to  get  the  raw  materials  and  equipments 
cost-effectively.  Cost  incurred  to  find  the  information  relating  to  the  suppliers 
(institutions) of the raw materials and equipment, their prices, etc. come under this 
category.

Examples :-  

Expenses incurred to visit the suppliers and inspect the materials 
and equipment, exchange the files and documents, sample 
inspection

Registration Expenses 

When starting a business it should be registered at authorized institutions. Further, 
for some businesses, a special approval or licenses should be obtained.

Examples :- 

A special license should be obtained from the following institutions 
when starting a business relating to granite quarrying 

Central Environmental Authority -Sri Lanka  

Department of Archeology

Geological Survey and Mines Bureau

Expenses incurred to register the business and to obtain licenses come under this 
category.

Other Expenses

All other expenses which are not mentioned above and but are to be incurred when 
starting a business come under this category.

Examples :-

Legal expenses, cost of business plan preparation, expenses for the 
inauguration ceremony

business  in  advance.  A  total  investment  estimate  is  prepared  for  this  purpose. 
Sometimes this is known as “cost of the project”.

Contents of a total investment estimate

The total investment estimate of a business plan consists with the following elements.

 Value of the fixed assets
 Expenses that should be incurred prior to business startup
 Initial funds required to conduct the day to day business activities 

                (working capital) 

Value of the fixed assets 

Fixed assets like land, buildings, machineries, equipments, vehicles and furniture 
are required to conduct business activities. These assets can be utilized for future 
years in the business. Here all long-term assets and their values that are included in 
the production, marketing and administrative plans mentioned earlier are considered 
as fixed assets of the business.

Expenses that should be incurred prior to business startup

We have studied the expenses that should be incurred prior to business startup in the 
section 5.2 above. All those expenses are taken in to consideration when preparing 
the total investment estimate. 

Expenses required to conduct the day to day business activities

Entrepreneur should possess an adequate amount of funds at the beginning of the 
business  in  order  to  conduct  the  business  activities  continuously  and  smoothly. 
The amount of cash required to conduct the day to day business activities are also 
known as working capital.

When deciding the initial working capital requirement of the business, it is necessary 
to calculate the production, marketing and administrative expenses that are required 
from the beginning of the business activities till cash flows in to the business. 

Such  working  capital  is  estimated  based  on  funds  required  for  all  expenses  for 
the  above  said  period  including  materials,  employee  salaries,  water,  telephone, 
advertising, distribution, rental and interest should be calculated.

It is unfavorable for a business to have an excessive working capital or a deficit and 
should maintain on an optimum level. If adequate working capital is not available 
within the business, the smooth and continuous flow of business activities will be 
disrupted.

Examples :-  

If enough cash is not available to buy the raw materials in due time, 
the business will not be able to do its production. As a result, all the
business activities will be stagnated and delayed and business will 
generate losses.

The disadvantage of maintaining a working capital surplus is the loss of 
income that can be earned by investing those money in another 
investment.

Having to pay a higher interest or comply with disadvantageous 
conditions when getting money instantly for a certain requirement 
could arise due to a working capital deficit.

After  deciding  the  value  of  fixed  assets,  pre-startup  costs  and  working  capital 
requirement, it is necessary to decide whether the business is going to cover those 
requirements through the owners’ investments or funds acquired from external parties.

Study  how  a  total  investment  estimate  is  prepared  through  the  following 
exercise.

5.5   Calculating the business results

By conducting a business an entrepreneur expects to earn profits. If the profit of the 
business at the end of a specific period is to be identified at present, such expected 
profit should be forecasted by considering the expected income and expenses.

The forecasted income statement included in the financial plan (a main component 
of a business plan) fulfills the above requirement of the entrepreneur. 

The forecasted income statement includes the following things.

Estimated total income

The total value of the products or services expected to be sold by a business during 
a specific period of time is known as estimated sales income. Both the cash sales 
and the credit sales should be considered here. Similarly, if there are other income, 
a business expects to earn, they should also be included here. Accordingly, the total 
expected income includes the sales income and other income expected to be earned 
during the period.  

Estimated total expenses 

All the expenses expected to incur for the products and services which are to 
expected to be sold during a specific period of time is known as estimated total
expenses. When calculating this expenditure, production cost and non-production 
cost should be stated separately.  

  Production cost

Expenses that directly contribute to the production of the business come 
under this category. When calculating the production cost following 
cost should be considered. 

    Material cost
    Labour cost
    Other costs (overhead cost)

   Non production cost

Expenses that do not directly relate to the production activities of the 
business come under this category. They are;

    Selling and distribution expenses included in the marketing plan
    Administrative expenses included in the administrative plan
    Financial expenses included in the financial plan (e.g. loan interest) 

Expected business result 

Expected business result can be calculated by deducting 
the  estimated  total  expenses  from  the  expected  total 
income. This can be a profit or a loss. The decision to 
start the business can be made, if the result is a profit and 
if the investor is satisfied that the profit is adequate for 
the money invested.

6.1   Introduction to business organizations 

You have already gained a good understanding about the preparation of business 
plans. The next step is selecting a suitable type of business organization in order to 
implement the plan. This chapter aims to give you the required guidance with this 
regard. At present different businesses help people to satisfy their needs and wants. 
Accordingly, businesses are related with all daily activities of people. The influence  
of businesses can be seen not only when we fulfill our daily requirements like foods 
and clothes, but also when satisfying our all other day today needs and wants.

Example :- 

Products like books, pens and pencils that you use

Different organizations that provide the services like banking and 

                        insurance

            Activity 01

Name  some  of  the  day  to  day  wants  of  your  home  and  state  the  business 
organizations that help to satisfy them. 

Want

Business organization

No.

02.

03.

04.

05.

After doing the above activity, you can understand that it is necessary to get the 
assistance of different parties in order to fulfill your needs and wants and you are 
clear  that  business  organizations  are  behind  all  these  activities. To  start  and  run 
businesses, individuals should organize as groups. Thus, units comprise of group 
of people working together for the purpose of achieving a common goal are called 
organizations. Accordingly, different business organizations have been established 
at present in order to satisfy the needs and wants of people.

Entities that engage in production and distribution of goods and services with the 
aim of earning profits, achieving social wellbeing or fulfilling any other objective 
while using limited resources to satisfy human needs and wants are called business 
organizations.

Some of the common characteristics that can be seen in every business organization 
are given below.

  Having an objective
  Using limited resources
  Having an organizational structure
  Engaging in an economic activity
  Having a group of people who work together (owners, employees etc.)

6.2   Classification of business organizations

Today different business organizations have been established to supply goods and 
services for the purpose of satisfying needs and wants of people. 

These different types of business organizations can be classified based on different 
criteria. Here, we consider only the following criteria which are often used. 

  Ownership
  Objective

Classification of business organizations based on ownership

The ownership of the business is explained based on the way the financial resources 
are provided to start the business. Parties that deploy resources in the business are 
called owners. Owners enjoy the profits or losses earned by a business.

Based on ownership, business organizations are classified as follows.

  Private sector businesses
  Public sector businesses

63

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When financial resources are deployed in a business by an individual or group of 
individuals, the ownership of the business is with the private sector. Then they are 
called private sector businesses.

Similarly  when  the  financial  resources  are  provided  by  the  government,  the 
ownership is with the government and they are called public sector organizations. 

Classification of businesses based on the ownership is given below.

    State companies

Figure 6.1: Classification of businesses based on ownership

Classification of business organizations based on their objectives

Entrepreneurs conduct businesses with the aim of achieving different objectives.  
Businesses can be classified as follows based on their objectives

  Profit oriented businesses
  Not-for profit organizations

If a business is carried out by an entrepreneur with the objective of gaining profit, 
such businesses are called profit oriented business organizations.

Examples :-

Private hospitals
Private banks
Super markets
Garment firms

Similarly,  the  objective  of  some  businesses  is  not  to  earn  profits  but  to  provide 
benefits to the society. Such organizations are called not-for profit organizations. 

Examples :-

Red Cross Society
Lions club
Sarvodaya
Sports clubs

Profit oriented businesses and not-for profit organizations are operating under both 
the private and the public sectors. Figure 6.2 depicts how the business organizations 
are classified based on the objective.

After  learning  the  above  information,  we  hope  that  you  have  understood  that 
businesses can be classified based on different criteria. An entrepreneur should be 
clever enough to select the most suitable type of business organization among these 
different types of business organization.

We discuss only the following types of business organizations which are classified 
based on ownership. 

   Sole proprietorships
   Partnerships
   Incorporated companies 

6.3  Sole proprietorships

At  present  sole  proprietorships  can  be 
identified  as  one  of  the  most  common 
business  types  that  many  entrepreneurs 
start. These are also known as single owner 
businesses.  Since  entrepreneurs  can  easily 
start  these  businesses  with  a  small  amount 
of capital, they can be seen in almost all the 
countries in the world. 

A  business  started,  owned  and  run  solely  by  the  owner  is  known  as  a  sole 
proprietorship. 

Figure 6.3

Main characteristics of sole proprietorship. 

Some of the main characteristics of sole proprietorships are given below.

  Capital is provided by the owner

An initial capital is required to get the different resources that are required to start 
the business. Investing the capital solely by the owner is a characteristic of sole 
proprietorships.  Capital  can  be  found  through  different  ways  including  owners’ 
savings, funds given by relatives or friends, a loan obtained by selling or mortgaging 
his/ her assets or a loan taken from a financial institution.

  Ownership rests with a single person

Since capital required for the business is invested by a single person, the ownership 
too is with that person.

  Profits or losses are borne alone

The profit earned by the business belongs to the owner. Similarly, if the business 
incurs losses, that should be borne by the owner alone. 

  No continued existence

The continuity of the business can stop due to such reasons as death of the owner, 
insanity or any other passivity.

  Unlimited liability of the owner

Liability means the obligations to repay the loans and other advances obtained from 
external  parties.  In  sole  proprietorships,  liability  of  the  owner  is  unlimited.  this 
means that even the private properties of the entrepreneur may have to be sacrificed  
to settle the liabilities of the business.

  Registration is not mandatory

It is not mandatory to register a sole proprietorship. Yet registration of the business 
is very useful. If it is registered, it will be registration of the business name. The 
business name will be registered under the Business Name Registration Ordinance, 
No.06 of 1918 at the divisional secretariat of the respective provincial council.

  No legal personality

This means that a sole proprietorship cannot conduct any legal operations by its 
own business name. If required to do so, it should be done by the name of the owner. 

Examples :- 

Filing legal  cases, obtaining bank loans, purchasing of vehicles 
should be done not by the name of the business but by the name of 
the owner.

  Business can solely be led at owner’s discretion  

Examples :- 

Hiring and firing of employees
Expanding the business operations
Making decisions regarding the price of the products

Starting  Sole Proprietorships  

Though starting a sole proprietorship is easy, there are few steps which should be 
followed practically by an entrepreneur. They are given below.

  Obtaining the following applications from the Divisional Secretariat from 

      the respective division where the business is expected to be started. 

     1.  An application form to register the business name of a sole proprietorship

     2.  An application form to obtain the required report from Grama Niladharee 
            regarding the registration of the business name

  Handing over the certified report of the Grama Niladharee and the duly completed 

      application form along with the registration fee to the Divisional Secretary. 

After  receiving  the  above  documents  along  with  the  due  payments,  Divisional 
Secretary will consider them, and if satisfied will register the business and issue the 
Certificate of Registration of Business Name.

            Activity 03       

Obtain the forms required to start a sole proprietorship.

            Activity 04      

Saman started a business enterprise using a small amount of money he had 
saved. He was happy as he didn’t have to make much effort and spend much 
time  for  the  initial  activities  in  the  establishment  of  the  business.  He  was 
committed to the business and worked hard.

Though different difficulties arose, he gave quick solutions to them converting 
the  issues  in  to  his  experiences  and  conducted  the  business  activities 
continuously. Once Saman had to appear before the courts as a customer 
filed a case against one of his employees for a mistake done by the employee. 
However, Saman was able to continue with his plans and run the business 
profitably. 

Though  Saman  wanted  to  improve  his  business  further,  he  realized  that 
obtaining the required additional capital is difficult. Even though there was 
the possibility of obtaining bank loans further, he was not interested to do so 
since there was the risk of settling them.

Though Saman got sick due to the heavy work load of the business, he always 
tried his best to carry on the business activities successfully.

6.4   Partnerships

Partnerships  too  have  received  an  important  place  in  the  economy  as  a  type  of 
a  private  sector  business  organization.  The  ability  of  entrepreneurs  to  engage 
in  business  activities  together  than  individually  has  been  a  major  reason  for  the 
establishment of partnerships. Similarly partnerships have emerged owing to the 
requirements of getting more capital, making right management decisions, getting 
the involvement of individuals with different skills, etc. It can be seen that people 
who are engaged in the professional fields such as accounting, law, tax and medicine 
and the parties who do production and trade organize as partnerships.   

Partnership Ordinance of 1980 affects 
the  partnerships  conducted 
in  Sri 
Lanka.  According  to  this  Ordinance, 
partnerships are defined as follows. 

A  relationship  between  two  or  more 
individuals with the objective of earning 
profits is known as a partnership. 

Figure 6.4

Main characteristics of partnerships

Special characteristics of a partnership are given bellow. 

  Number of partners

In order to start a  partnership there should be  minimum of  two partners and the 
maximum number is limited to 20.

  Existence of an agreed (stipulated) relationship among partners 

A partnership is started according to the agreement arrived by the partners. This 
agreement  can  be  written,  oral  or  implied.  The  agreement  among  the  partners 
regarding the partnership is known as the partnership agreement.

  No continued existence 

The continuity of the partnership is obstructed due to the change of the partnership 
agreement or due to the death, insanity or bankruptcy of a partner.

  Unlimited liability of the partners

Partners  are  unlimitedly  liable  for  the  liabilities  of  the  partnership. Accordingly, 
partners  may have to sacrifice their private properties to pay off the debt of the 
partnership  if  the  assets  of  the  partnership  are  not  sufficient  when  settling  its 
liabilities. 

  No separate legal identity

Since  a  partnership  is  not  considered  as  a  legal  person  before  the  law,  it  cannot 
perform  legal  activities  in  its  business  name.  Hence,  the  legal  matters  of  the 
partnership should be done not in its business name but using the personal names 
of the partners. 

  Not mandatory to register a partnership

It is not mandatory to register a partnership. Yet many advantages can be obtained 
by  registering  a  partnership.  Here  the  business  name  of  the  partnership  will  be 
registered.  Registration  can  be  done  under  the  Business  Name  Registration 
Ordinance, No 06 of 1918 at the Divisional Secretariat of the respective provincial 
council. 

  Every partner will be a representative (or an agent) of other partners

Every partner is liable for the affairs done by each partner. Hence, every partner is 
considered as a representative of other partners. 

Starting a partnership

A  partnership  can  be  started  in  the  same 
way  as  a  sole  proprietorship.  Yet,  since 
there  may  be  a  maximum  up  to  20 
partners,  it  might  face  different  practical 
issues when running the business. Though 
a  partnership  agreement  can  be  arrived 
at  in  writing,  orally  or  by  implication 
(implied),  it  is  more  suitable  to  conduct 
the  partnership on a written agreement. 

Figure 6.5

This written agreement is known as the partnership deed. 
It is important to have the stipulated agreement in writing in order to minimize the 
practical issues that may arise in a partnership when doing business.

Amal Piyarathne and Kamal Jayarathne started a partnership to sell garments and 
agreed to register it under the name of “Rathna Dress”. Further they agreed to put 
Rs 50,000 by each and to equally share the profits and losses of the business. Kamal 
decided not to engage in business activities since he was doing another job and it 
was agreed that Amal should attend to the marketing affairs of the business for a 
monthly salary of Rs. 20,000. Moreover, they decided to pay an annual interest of 
10% for the extra funds invested in the business other than the capital. Similarly 
they decided that in case if a new partner joins the business, it should be done with 
the consent of both partners.

Prepare  a  partnership  deed  for  the  partnership,  “Rathna  Dress”  according  to  the 
above information.

6.5  Incorporated companies

Incorporated companies can be identified as a popular form of business organization 
which mainly represents the private sector category. Companies Act No. 07 of 2007 
of Sri Lanka affects the commencement of an incorporated company. 

Since  even  a  single  person  can  start  an  incorporated  company  according  to  the 
Companies Act of Sri Lanka, most of the entrepreneurs are interested in starting 
this type of businesses. Receiving the status of a legal personality is another reason 
for the popularity of incorporated companies.

An incorporated company can simply be defined as follows.

Incorporated companies are business organizations which are registered under the 
Companies Act  No.  07  of  2007  and  which  have  a  separate  legal  identity  and  a 
continued existence.

  Raising capital through shareholders

the shares they had bought from the company.

  Management of the company is done by directors

The management of a company is done by directors selected and appointed by the 
company shareholders who are the owners of the company too. 

  Having a continued existence

An incorporated company is a separate entity from its owners. Hence the death, 
bankruptcy or full or half passivity of a shareholder does not obstruct the continuation 
of the company. 

  Have a separate legal personality

Companies  are  incorporated  under  the  Companies  Act  No  07  of  2007.  Hence,  an 
incorporated company is considered as a legal person and entering in to contracts, 
acquiring assets, obtaining loans from financial institutions etc., can be done in the 
name of the company.

7.1   Introduction to culture

At the beginning of human civilization it can be seen that man has been working 
with different parties of the society as well as with the various cultures in satisfying 
their  needs  and  wants. The  values  of  a  culture  shape  the  people.  Culture  can  be 
explained as beliefs, values, attitudes, behavior patterns, different ideas, customs 
and norms that exist among people of a society which are unique to them. Depending 
on the characteristics of these cultural elements, the behavior of the people will be 
decided.

   Example :-  
         In Sri Lankan society, people from different races like Sinhalese, 
              Tamils, Muslims and Burgers are living together and these ethnic 
               groups possess values, beliefs, attitudes and different behaviors which 
              are unique to them.

7.2   Introduction to entrepreneurial culture

Entrepreneurial culture is a collection of elements like special behaviors, attitudes, 
beliefs,  ideas,  behavior  patterns,  rites,  rituals,  and  customs  which  are  unique  to 
entrepreneurs. 

A person living in the entrepreneurial society inherits entrepreneurial traits. That 
is the person who thinks positively, accepts risks creatively and does innovations. 
Moreover, such people are dissatisfied with the status quo and try to change the 
prevailing condition. Further those people are very sensitive to the environment and 
owing to that sensitivity they have the capability of identifying the opportunities 
and chasing them. As soon as the opportunities are identified, they exploit them.

7.3   Need for the creation of an entrepreneurial culture

Most of the countries in the world have developed due to the influence of cultural 
and social forces. Since efforts are being taken to develop Sri Lanka, the need for an 
entrepreneurial culture is highlighted. Solutions to most of the economic and social 
problems of Sri Lanka can be found through this.

 A Solution to unemployment 

The  unemployment  rate  of  Sri  Lanka  is  considerable.  The  nature  of  this 
unemployment is very complex.

 Example :-
      Unemployment is high among educated people than the uneducated 

                    people.

      Unemployment is at a high percentage among the youth aged below 30 
          years.

      A considerable percentage of the workforce of Sri Lanka migrates for jobs.

      Unemployment is high among educated women.

Hence the creation of jobs for the workforce of Sri Lanka can be done very easily 
within an entrepreneurial culture. 

 Achievement of economic growth

If an economy is to grow, production of goods and services within that economy 
should  increase.  Any  country  can  achieve  high  economic  growth  through  an 
entrepreneurial culture. 

 Availability of unused resources

Sri  Lanka  is  a  land  full  of  resources.  Those  resources  are  not  properly  utilized 
at  present.  There  is  a  possibility  of  generating  products  by  using  those  unused 
resources.

  Need for new job creators

It has become difficult to provide jobs for the people compared to the population 
growth of Sri Lanka. In order to provide jobs, new businesses should be created. As 
a result, direct and indirect jobs will be created when conducting and developing 
those businesses.

 Need to minimize the inconsistencies in income distribution

Inconsistency in income distribution occurs when a large part of the population of 
the country receives a small portion of the national income and small part of the 
population receives a large portion of the national income.   

Through  popularization  of  the  entrepreneurial  culture,  entrepreneurial  ability  of 
many people will be improved. Through that ability, they can earn profits. Further 
through the increase in employment, income will flow to the low income earning 
segment. This will minimize the inconsistencies in income distribution.

7.4  Social and economic factors conducive for the emergence  
       of an entrepreneurial culture

There are many social and economic factors favourable for the emergence of an 
entrepreneurial culture. Some of them are given below.

 Existence of a favorable economic environment

To start and run new businesses, there should be a favourable economic environment 
for entrepreneurs. Economic factors should be in favour of business activities. This 
include factors such as low interest rates, increase in income level and favourable 
foreign exchange rates.

 Stable political condition

Having  a  political  authority  which  makes  favourable  rules  and  regulations  and 
policies for the identification of solutions to economic and social problems giving 
prominence  to  entrepreneurship  while  securing  it  will  be  very  helpful  for  the 
emergence of an entrepreneurial culture. Further the political authority should have 
understood the rewards of entrepreneurship.

 Incentives given by government and other organizations

Government and public sector organizations can immensely support the upliftment 
of entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurial culture can be developed by giving financial 
and non-financial aids.

   Examples :-
        Giving tax relief
        Giving loans under concessionary conditions
        Giving training and advice
        Giving aids
        Facilitating the meetings of local and foreign buyers
        Organizing workshops and exhibitions

 Having a family background which encourages entrepreneurship

A  family  background  which  encourages  entrepreneurship  will  positively  affect 
the creation of an entrepreneurial culture. Creation of an environment within the 
family which encourages the development of entrepreneurial capabilities will help 
the generation of successful entrepreneurs in the future. There is a greater tendency 
for new generations to choose entrepreneurial activities when their families have 
family businesses which have existed continuously. This too is a favorable factor 
which help the emergence of an entrepreneurial culture. 

 Encouragement given by large businesses

Large businesses often get the help of small and medium scale businesses when 
conducting their businesses. Hence large businesses always provide different aids 
to small and medium scale businesses.

     Examples :-  

   Obtaining raw materials and parts required by large companies from 
      small businesses. Transferring some production activities to small 
     businesses (sub contracting)

 Ability of obtaining resources

Availability of ample resources and ability to use them for production are factors 
which encourage entrepreneurship.

factor which influences the creation of an entrepreneurial culture. Such a guidance 
will help the entrepreneurs to understand the way they should proceed.

 Encouragement given by different parties

Encouragement given by the members of the family, school, different societies and 
friends, makes a favourable impact for the creation of an entrepreneurial culture. At 
present, newspapers and electronic media can play a big role in this regard.

7.5   Social factors which obstruct entrepreneurship

There are many personal rewards of being an entrepreneur. Further, entrepreneurs 
generate  higher  rewards  for  the  economy  as  well.  One  of  the  mechanisms  of 
the  development  of  a  country  is  entrepreneurship.   Yet  many  are  reluctant  to  be 
entrepreneurs.

Let’s discuss some social factors that go against entrepreneurship.

  High recognition given to salaried jobs

The dream of most of Sri Lankans is to do a highly paid job. The reason for this 
is the tendency of the society to judge the success and the recognition of a person 
from his or her job. Owing to this attitude, many are used to wait expecting a job 
by suppressing their entrepreneurial skills. 

  Reluctance to accept risks and challenges

A main characteristic of an entrepreneur is the readiness to accept manageable 
risks. They should accept the challenge of making their innovations successful. 
Therefore, the unwillingness of people to accept risk and challenges is another 
barrier to the entrepreneurship.

  Lack of encouragement from education

The present traditional education system does not support the generation of people 
who can see the world with a creative mind, change the status quo and accept risks 
and challenges. This acts as a barrier for entrepreneurship.

  Insufficient government support

Weaknesses of policies which are for the development of entrepreneurship in Sri 
Lanka and insufficiency of incentives given to promote entrepreneurs are barriers 
for entrepreneurship.

89

  Dependent mentality

Most of the Sri Lankans today have high expectations towards what they inherit 
from their parents and try to live by spending what they have inherited thereafter. 
Further, they expect subsidies given by the government. People are reluctant to earn 
what they need through their own effort. Such mentality acts as a negative factor 
which demotivates people from being entrepreneurs.

7.6   Role of women in entrepreneurship

        ‘The hand that rocks the cradle, rules the world’

to 

The  above  saying  depicts  the  unique  capability 
within a woman. They can lead anything towards 
success  due 
their  creativity,  dedication, 
risk  taking  ability,  intelligence,  gumption  and 
flexibility. Owing to above qualities, women today 
choose to be successful entrepreneurs individually 
or as groups by identifying new opportunities and 
converting  them  to  their  own  business.  Further 
they  provide  job  opportunities  to  others  through 
their businesses. 

Need of women choosing to do businesses

It has become necessary for women to enter into the entrepreneurship field today. 
There are many reasons for this.

Figure 7.3

  To achieve a satisfactory income level

Since  cost  of  living  has  increased  at  present,  it  has  become  difficult  to  run  the 
affairs of a home only with the income of one individual. In order to avoid this, it is 
necessary for women to earn an income through a business.

  Majority of the population being women

When  analyzing  the  composition  of  population  of  Sri  Lanka,  it  is  evident  that 
women represents the majority. Hence, we can come to the conclusion that there 
is a considerable women representation within the workforce of Sri Lanka. Hence, 
women should venture in to business and should give their contribution to uplift the 
economy of the country.

  High unemployment among women

Unemployment rate is high among women. It is a waste of resources of a country. 
When  women  enter  in  to  business,  their  contribution  can  be  used  to  increase 
the  national  production.  It  will  be  a  solution  to  unemployment  since  they  create 
employment for themselves and for the others. 

  Existence of  businesses which need contribution of women

Women’s contribution is needed for the businesses which require unique skills of 
women and qualities like softness and kindness.

   Examples :- 
              Pre-schools, Nursing, Beauty culture, Day care centers, Fashion 
                    designing  

  Trend of women getting higher education  

There  is  an  increasing  trend  among  women  to  get  school  education  as  well  as 
higher education. They can contribute for the economic development of the country 
by starting businesses independently by making use of the higher education they 
acquired.

Opportunities for women to do business

It is important to have opportunities within the business environment for women 
to enter into business. Following are some such opportunities which can be seen in 
the economy of Sri Lanka.

 High demand created for services

A  high  demand  for  different  services  has  been  created  in  order  to  fulfill  human 
needs and wants owing to the facts like busy schedules of people, and increase in 
income levels. Opportunities are open for women to provide those services.

   Examples :- 
            Selling processed foods 
            Laundry service
            Day care service

Figure  7.4

 Existence of business opportunities which can be started with a low investment 

     and low risk

   Examples :-  
            Event management – organizing different functions
            Organizing local and overseas tours

 Unique financial and non -financial incentives being introduced to women

   Examples :-  
            Giving loans at lower interest or interest free
                   Conducting entrepreneurial training programmers for women

 Changing social attitudes regarding women

   Examples :-  
        Recognition given to women 
                      in the society has been increased

               Acknowledging the economic 
            contribution  made by women

                 Women engaging in activities

businesses. Sometimes women refrain from being 
an entrepreneur due to those barriers. Some such 
barriers are given below.

 Challenge of balancing the roles of the 
      personal life and the role as an entrepreneur

 Women have to give prominence to    
               household activities and as a result

         Activity 02

Naveesha was a student in grade 08 and is the eldest daughter of a family which had 
economic difficulties. Her brother is studying in grade 04. Her father is a labourer 
and mother is a house wife. The salary of Naveesha’s father is not enough for all the 
household activities. Yet her mother was frugal and responsible enough to spend 
a greater portion of the income on the education of children and the rest for other 
needs of the home. Though income difficulties were there, they lived a happy life. 

One  day  Naveesha’s  father  met  with  an  accident  and  became  bed-ridden.  As 
a  result,  he  lost  his  job.  Naveesha  regretted  a  lot  seeing  the  helplessness  of  her 
mother who didn’t receive any income for the medical treatments of her father and 
for the household affairs. Naveesha’s mother was a very courageous woman and 
she determined to stand on her own. Naveesha’s mother started a small institution 
which makes handbags utilizing the resources available in her area with the small 
amount of money she has saved. Naveesha was amazed when she saw the dedication 
of her mother who worked hard for her business day and night while doing all the 
work of her father without any negligence.

Her  creations  were  different  when  compared  to  the  other  handbags  available  in 
the market. As a result she was able to increase the sales of her products. She was 
able to give jobs in her business for four women of her area within a short period 
of time and became a famous and a successful individual of the area. Further, she 
was selected as a member of the executive committee of the women’s society of the 
area. The fact that she was able to continue the education of her children and earn 
a satisfactory income to nurture them witnessed that she had successfully faced the 
challenge of balancing the roles of her personal life and the role as an entrepreneur. 

After recovering fully, Naveesha’s father was satisfied with the achievements her 
mother had gained when he was disabled and decided not to seek other jobs and to 
join and develop the business of Naveesha’s mother. Naveesha too determined to be 
a successful woman entrepreneur like her mother after studying well.

Read the above case carefully and answer the following questions.

01. Identify the entrepreneurial characteristics of Naveesha’s mother.

7.7  Business ethics and social responsibility

Business Ethics

A  business  should  earn  profits  without  harming  the  environment  and  any  other 
party. For that it is necessary to follow a code of ethics when running businesses. 
Those business ethics depend upon the values of the people who are involved in 
the business. 

Common agreements arrived at in writing, verbally or symbolically, by a person or 
a group of people regarding what is right and what is wrong or what is good and 
what is bad are called business ethics. 

   Examples :-  
        Giving priority to the consumer in every business affair
        Doing business without harming the natural environment

Suggest few business ethics that should be followed by a business.

          Activity 06

List ten activities that can happen in a business which violate business ethics.

Social Responsibility of a Business 

The  traditional  view  regarding  the  social  responsibility  of  a  business  is  that  a 
business should provide maximum returns for the capital invested by the owners. 
But at present, the social responsibility of a business has become a broader concept.

Social  responsibility  of  a  business  indicates  that  a  business  has  a  responsibility 
towards  the  owners  of  the  business  as  well  as  the  whole  external  society  within 
which the business is operated and nurtured.

Hence  businesses  should  pay  attention  to  the  prevailing  issues  of  the  society 
including protecting the environment, economic development, social and cultural 
development and establishment of a peaceful society. 

Levels of Social Responsibility of a Business 

Social responsibility of a business can be fulfilled according to the following ways.

01.  Economic responsibility
02.  Legal responsibility
03.  Ethical responsibility
04.  Philanthropic responsibility 

96

For free distribution.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
01. Economic responsibility

The responsibility to contribute to increase the rewards of the owners of the business. 
Fulfillment of this is essential for the survival of the business.

   Examples :-  
         Securing the financial stability of the business, profitability, using 
             limited resources efficiently.

02. Legal responsibility 

This is to conducting the business according to the rules and regulations imposed 
by the government and other institutions. 

   Examples :- 
        Paying Employees Provident Fund properly
        Refraining from environmental pollution
        Refraining from using prohibited raw materials

03. Ethical responsibility

This is to comply with the written or symbolic rules which are believed to be right 
by the society in which the business operates. 

Even  though  these  responsibilities  are  not  compulsory  in  order  to  conduct  the 
business,  they  are  fulfilled  by  businesses  as  they  represent  the  expectations  of 
different social parties. 

   Examples :-
        Giving equal job opportunities to women and to the minority

        Training and development of employees 

        Improving the quality of the product/service

04. Philanthropic responsibility 

These are the responsibilities which are not essential for the survival of the business 
and not directly expected by different parties of the society from the business. These 
are  the  high  level  responsibilities  which  are  fulfilled  voluntarily  by  a  business 
without expecting anything in return.

Examples :-
     Sponsoring community events including sports, educational and health events

Stakeholders of a Business

Stakeholders  are  the  parties  who  are  influenced  directly  or  indirectly  due  to  the 
conduct of a business.

These parties have different expectations. Some examples for such expectations are 
given below.

        Party 

           Expectation

   Owners         Satisfactory return to the capital invested

   Employees 

  Earning a reasonable salary and the job security.

   Creditors       Recovering the loans provided within the due period    

          Government   Complying with the rules and regulations and charging    
                                        taxes properly    

          Consumers     Obtaining quality products at a reasonable price.

As given in the above illustration different parties believe that their expectations will 
be met and when they are not being met they tend to act against the business. Hence, 
a business should decide their policies and ethics, in a way that the expectations of 
the above groups are met.

Rewards of Complying with Social Responsibility

 Improve the goodwill of the business
 Ensure the long term survival of the business
 Possibility of legal issues to emerge will be low 
 High profitability is ensured as the demand for the products and services 

    of the business increases 

 Satisfaction and loyalty of employees will increase

responsibility of increasing the welfare of that economy.

03 Stakeholders  are  satisfied  when  a  business  complies  with  the 

equitable ethics which are acknowledged by a society.

04 Responsibilities with which a business should comply affect the 

survival of the business.

05 Responsibilities that the whole society believes a business will 
essentially fulfill are called philanthropic responsibilities.
