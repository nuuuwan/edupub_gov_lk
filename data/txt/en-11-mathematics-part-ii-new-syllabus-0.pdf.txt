Introduction
Our daily household expenses fall into two main categories as capital expenses
and recurrent expenses. Recurrent expenses are the expenses we incur on a regular
basis and would include our spending on food, clothes, medicine and electricity
bills.
Capital expenses are one-time expenses that are not repeated on a regular basis.
For instance our spending on purchasing a land, a house, a vehicle, machinery or
furniture is a capital expense. Such purchases are generally of significant value
and may often require a loan from the place of work or from a financial institution.
For free distribution
Money borrowed as a loan is not paid back in full right away. Rather, it is paid
back over a long period of time as monthly partial payments.Usually a loan is
expected to be repaid with interest. The part of the loan and the interest that is to be
paid every month is referred to as a loan instalment. However, some manufacturers
or distributors may sell their merchandise on an interest free installment plan to
promote sales.
Example 1
A furniture manufacturer sells a Rs 30 000 worth wooden wardrobe on an interest
free scheme of 12 monthly payments.What is the amount paid as an instalment?
Instalment amount
= Rs 30 000
= Rs 2 500
Example 2
A festival advance of Rs 5000 is given to employees of government institutions.
This interest free advance has to be paid back in 10 equal monthly instalments. If
each installment is deducted from the salary, what is the amount deducted from the
salary each month?
The amount deducted from the monthly salary each month = Rs 5 000
= Rs 500
9.1 Calculating interest on the reducing balance
There are several ways of charging interest on a loan. Calculating the loan interest
on the reducing balance is a common method. Let us explore this.
When you borrow money to repay in monthly instalments, or if you purchase an
item with a down payment with the understanding that the rest of the money will be
paid in instalments, most of the time you will be expected to pay an interest on the
loan. Here, the loan is paid in monthly instalments. The interest calculation is based
on the outstanding loan balance. That is the balance money that remains in the
borrowers hands as the loan is repaid during the loan term. As the borrower repays
instalments, the remaining loan balance reduces over time. Interest is then charged
only on the loan amount that the borrower still holds. Therefore this method of
calculating the interest is called, computing the interest on the reducing balance.
Once the total interest to be paid is calculated, the monthly installments are
determined, such that every installment is of the same value.
Study the following examples to understand the method of calculating the loan
interest on the reducing balance and the value of an installment.
Example 1
Mr Wickramasinghe has borrowed Rs 30 000 as a business loan from a bank that
charges an annual interest rate of 24%. The loan has to be paid back in six equal
monthly instalments and the interest is calculated on the reducing balance. Calculate
the value of a monthly instalment.
The loan amount = Rs 30 000
Amount due from the principal loan per month without interest = Rs 30 000
In this method, the outstanding loan balance is reduced by Rs 5000 every month
and interest is charged only on the loan balance.
= Rs 5 000
Annual interest rate
Monthly interest rate
= 24%
Interest charged for the first month = Rs 30 000
= Rs 600
Interest charged for the second month = Rs 25 000
Interest charged for the third month
= Rs 500
= Rs 20 000
= Rs 400
Interest charged for the fourth month = Rs 15 000
= Rs 300
Interest charged for the fifth month
= Rs 10 000
= Rs 200
Interest charged for the sixth month = Rs 5 000
= Rs 100
The total interest paid = Rs 600 + 500 + 400 + 300 + 200 + 100
= Rs 2 100
Total amount to be paid after 6 months = loan without interest + interest
The total amount paid = Rs 30 000 + 2 100
... value of a monthly installment = Rs 32 100 .. 6
= Rs 32 100
= Rs 5 350
Calculating the interest as in the above method could be lengthy and time consuming.
Therefore we adopt the following easier method to calculate the interest.
Interest charged on amount due per month from the principal
= Rs 5 000
Therefore,
the total interest paid = Rs 100 6 + 100 5 + 100 4 + 100 3 + 100 2 + 100 1
= Rs100
= Rs 100 (6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1)
= Rs 100 21
= Rs 2 100
where 21 is the total number of portions of the loan that is to be paid within the six
months.We will call this the number of month units. We calculate the number of
month units as
month units = 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 21
This can be thought of as a sum of an arithmetic progression and can be found using
the formula n
(a + l). Then
month units
(6 + 1)
= 3 7
That is,
month units =
number of instalments
^number of instalments + 1&
Example 2
A television priced at Rs 25 000 can be purchased by making a down payment of
Rs 7 000 and paying the remainder by 12 equal monthly installments. If an annual
interest rate of 18% is charged on the loan,where the interest is calculated on the
reducing balance, find the value of a monthly installment.
Price of the television = Rs 25 000
The down payment = Rs 7 000
∴ Balance to be paid in installments = Rs 25 000 – 7 000
Duration of the loan = 12 month
= Rs 18 000
∴ Portion of the loan paid in one month = Rs 18 000 .. 12
∴ Interest paid for a month unit = Rs 1 500 18
= Rs 1 500
= Rs 22.50
The number of month units the loan is paid over =
(12 + 1)
= 6 13
∴ Total interest paid = Rs 22.50 78
= Rs 1 755
∴ Total amount paid = Rs 18 000 + 1 755
= Rs 19 755
∴ The amount of an installment = Rs 19 755 .. 12
= Rs1 646.25
Example 3
The following advertisement was displayed in a shop:
A washing machine worth Rs 30 000 is available for a down payment of
Rs 5000 and 10 equal monthly instalments of Rs 2720.
If the interest on the loan was calculated on the reducing loan balance, calculate the
interest rate.
Price of the washing machine = Rs 30 000
The down payment = Rs 5 000
Balance to be paid in installments = Rs 30 000 – 5 000
= Rs 25 000
Portion of the loan paid according to the one month = Rs 25 000 ..10
The amount paid according to the installment plan = Rs 2 720 10
= Rs 2 500
Total interest paid = Rs 27 200 – 25 000
= Rs 27 200
The number of month units the loan is paid over =
(10 + 1)
= Rs 2 200
Interest for a monthly unit = Rs 2 200 .. 55
= Rs 40
The annual interest rate = 40
2 500
100% 12
= 19.2%

interest on the loan is calculated on the reducing loan balance, find the annual
interest rate.
9.2 Compound Interest
An alternative way of calculating interest for an amount of money borrowed or
deposited is the compound interest method. Let us explore how the interest is
calculated under this method through an example.
At a bank that pays an annual interest rate of 10%, the account statement provided
at the end of 3 years, to a person who has maintained a Rs 25 000 fixed account is
as follows.
Description
Deposits (Rs)
Interest (Rs)
2013.01.01

25 000.00
2013.12.31
2014.01.01
2014.12.31
2015.01.01
2015.12.31
2016.01.01

30 250.00
33 275. 00
2 500.00
2 750.00
3 025.00
According to the above statement the depositor has earned Rs 2 500 as interest in
the year 2013. It is clear that the interest earned is 10% of the principal deposit.
The sum of the money deposited in 2013 and the interest earned in the year 2013
that amounts to 27 500 is considered as the total in the account on 2014.01.01.
Furthermore, the interest earned in the year 2014 is 2750 and it is 10% of the total
Rs 27500. It is apparent that the interest earned at the end of the year is added to the
account balance and the interest for the next year is calculate on the new balance.
In this manner, when the interest is calculated every year, not only the principal
but the previously earned interest also earns interest. The addition of interest to the
principal is called compounding and the interest calculation on the compounded
amount is called the compound interest method.
The compound interest method can be used when calculating interest on a loan as
well as on a deposit.
Example 1
If a person takes a loan of Rs 10 000 at a compound interest rate of 10% per year,
calculate the total amount required to repay the entire loan in two years.
Loan amount = Rs 10 000
Compound interest rate = 10%
Interest for the first year = Rs 10 000 10
= Rs 1 000
Loan amount at the end of the first year = Rs 10 000 + 1 000
Interest for the second year = Rs 11 000 10
= Rs 11 000
= Rs 1 100
Loan amount at the end of the second year = Rs 11 000 + 1 100
= Rs 12 100
As in the above example, compound interest can be calculated separately for each year
and added to the loan amount to find the total loan amount due.
Example 2
Amal invests Rs 50 000 for 3 years in a fixed deposit account which pays 6% annual
interest compounded yearly. Nimal invests Rs 50 000 in an account which pays 6%
annual simple interest. Calculate the amounts received by Amal and Nimal at the end
of three years separately.
Total amount received by Amal at the end of the first year = Rs 50 000 106
= Rs 53 000.00
Total amount received by Amal at the end of the second year = Rs 53 000 106
Total amount received by Amal at the end of the third year = Rs 56 180 106
= Rs 56 180.00
Interest received by Nimal at the end of the third year
= Rs 59 550.80
= Rs 50 000 6
= Rs 9 000.00
Total amount received by Nimal at the end of three years = Rs 9 000 + 50 000
= Rs 59 000.00
Total amount received by Amal at the end of three years can also be obtained by
Rs 50 000 106
= Rs 59 550.80 .
Exercise 9.2
1. If a person takes a loan of Rs 5 000 at a compound interest rate of 5% per year,
calculate the total amount required to repay the entire loan in two years.
2. If a person deposits Rs 6 000 into an account paying 7% annual interest compounded
yearly, how much money will be in the account after 2 years?
3. Radha deposits Rs 8 000 in an account paying 12% annual interest compounded
yearly. After one year the bank interest rate drops to 10%. How much money
will Radha receive in total as interest at the end of 2 years?
4. Hashan and Caseem are two friends. If Hashan lends Rs 25 000 at a simple
annual interest rate of 15% and Caseem lends 25 000 at an interest rate of 14%
compounded yearly on the same date, calculate who receives more money after
three years.
5. At the beginning of a year a person deposits Rs 40 000 in a bank that pays 12%
annual interest compounded every six month (semi annually). Compute how
much money in total he receives at the end of the year.
6. A person who has loaned a certain amount at 8% interest compounded yearly,
receives Rs 432 as compound interest at the end of two years. Find the amount
that he loaned.
Miscellaneous Exercise
1. A television is priced at Rs 45 000. A person who buys it outright for cash, receives
a discount of 6% and a person going for an instalment plan can make a down
payment of Rs 9 000 and pay the remainder in 12 equal monthly instalments. A
24% annual interest rate is charged on the loan, where the interest is calculated
on the reducing balance.
(a) What is the total amount paid if the TV is bought outright for cash?
(b) What is the total amount paid if the TV is bought on an instalment plan?
(c) How profitable is it to buy the TV outright for cash than on an installment
plan?

annually and deposits it in a bank that pays 8% interest compounded annually.
What is the profit of his investment after 2 years?
3. A person takes a loan at a certain interest rate compounded annually. If he has
to pay Rs 14 400 to settle the entire loan in 2 years or Rs 17 280 to settle it in

• identify the stock market and its nature
• identify terms related to the stock market
• calculate the dividends gained by investing in the stock market
• solve problems related to shares
Introduction
In this lesson we will consider businesses in Sri Lanka which are incorporated
companies registered under the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007. These companies
may be owned by an individual or a group of individuals. Of these companies, the
companies which are limited by shares can be classified as follows.
² Private limited companies
² Public limited companies
Public limited companies raise capital to commence or continue their business by
issuing shares or debentures to the general public. The public is notified regarding
the issue of shares through the media. When the public buy shares, they have the
right to sell these shares to others. The stock market is where the trading of these
shares occurs.
Stock Market
The Stock Market (Stock Exchange) is a place where securities such as shares and
debentures issued by companies are traded. The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) is
the organization responsible for the operation of the stock market in Sri Lanka. The
CSE is licensed by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) to
operate as a stock market in Sri Lanka. The SEC regulates and oversees the stock
market. Companies are admitted to the official list of the CSE as listed companies.
On April 21st 2015 there were 297 companies listed in the Sri Lankan stock market.
The public who wish to buy or sell securities in the stock market must register
with one or more of the 15 licensed stockbroker firms of the CSE who attend to the
transactions. Some brokers offer trading through the internet.
10.1 Shares
Public limited companies which are listed in the stock market, that wish to raise
capital by involving the public, do this by issuing “shares”. A share is one of the
equal parts into which a company’s stated capital is divided.
When a company issues new shares, the price of a share is decided by the company
itself. The public can invest in as many shares as they like. An investor who buys
shares in a company becomes a part owner of that company. The stake he has in the
company is proportional to the number of shares he owns.
To understand this further, consider the following example.
An investor buys 10 000 shares from the 100 000 shares issued to the public by a
certain company. Then the investor has a share of
10 0 00
100 000
in the company. Let us
express this as a percentage.
10 0 00
100 000
100] = 10].
Therefore, the investor has 10% ownership of the company.
Example 1
Company C which has a stated capital of Rs 10 000 000, issues 100 000 shares to
the public at Rs 100 per share. Vishwa buys 5000 of these shares.
(i) Express Vishwa’s share in the company,
(a) as a fraction
(b) as a percentage.
(ii) Find the amount that Vishwa invested in company C.
(i) Total number of shares issued by the company = 100 000
Number of shares Vishwa bought = 5 000
(a) Vishwa’s share in the company as a fraction =
5 0 00
100 000
(b) Vishwa’s share in the company as a percentage =
20 100]
Price of a share
The number of shares Vishwa purchased
The amount Vishwa invested
= Rs 100
= 5 000
= Rs 100 5 000
= Rs 500 000
Dividends
When a listed company issues new shares, it gives notice of the benefits that
shareholders will enjoy. Dividends are payments out of the earnings of the company
which some companies give their shareholders as a benefit. It is expressed in terms
of the amount paid per share. This is paid out quarterly or annually.
For example, a company may pay its shareholders annual dividends of Rs 5 per
share. The company has the right to change this amount with time.
Let us consider again the above example to clarify this further.
Example 1
Company C pays annual dividends of Rs 4 per share, for the Rs 100 shares it issued,
of which Vishwa bought 5 000 shares.
(i) Find the annual income that Vishwa receives through this investment.
(ii) Express Vishwa’s annual income as a percentage of the amount he
invested.
(i) The number of shares Vishwa owns = 5000
Annual dividends per share = Rs 4
... Vishwa’s annual income = Rs 5000 4
= Rs 20 000
(ii) Amount that Vishwa invested = Rs 100 5 000
= Rs 100 5 000
= Rs 500 000
... Vishwa’s annual income as a percentage =
of his investment
20 000
50 0 000
= 4 ]
Now do the following exercise pertaining to the facts on initial investments in
shares.
Exercise 10.1
1. An investor purchases 1000 shares of value Rs 25 per share in the company Sasiri
Apparels.
(i) How much did the person invest?
(ii) If the company pays annual dividends of Rs 4 per share, find the investor’s
annual dividends income.

year from this investment was Rs 12 000.
(i) Find the number of shares Mahela owns in this company.
(ii) Find the amount Mahela invested to buy shares in this company.
5. Ganesh spends exactly half of Rs 100 000 to buy a certain number of Rs 25 shares
in a company that pays annual dividends of Rs 4 per share. He decides to deposit
the remaining amount in a financial institute which pays an annual interest rate
of 12%. Show with reasons, which of the two investments is more advantageous.
10.2 Trading in the stock market
We learnt earlier that only listed companies are able to trade their shares in the stock
market. Let us consider the following note to learn about the trading of shares that
is done after a listed company has issued new shares to the public.
Nethmi Limited Company which pays annual dividends of Rs 2 per share, issued
100 000 shares to the public at Rs 10 per share at its initial offering. In a year, the
value of these shares had increased in the stock market to Rs 20 per share, at which
time Nadeesha bought 1000 shares. A few years later, when the price of a share in
this company had increased to Rs 28, Nadeesha sold her 1000 shares.
The primary market is where investors buy new shares issued by a company.
Shares can only be bought in the primary market, and the purchases are done
directly from the issuing company at the initial price stated by the company itself.
However, subsequent to the original issuance of shares in the primary market,
trading of shares can be done by investors in the secondary market. The price of
a share in the secondary market is called the market price. The market price of a
share varies with time depending on the demand.
In the above example, the price of a share in Nethmi Limited Company increased
from Rs 10 to Rs 20 in a year and subsequently after several years to Rs 28. Such
increases and decreases in the price of a share occur in the secondary market, where
investors are able to trade their shares.
Capital Gain
The price at which a share is bought in a company at the initial offering or later at
the market price is called the purchase price of the share and the market price at
which it is sold is called the selling price of the share.
When an investor sells shares he owns he may make a profit or incur a loss.
When he sells his shares,
if the selling price > purchase price, then he makes a capital gain and
the capital gain = selling price – purchase price.
Similarly,
if the selling price < purchase price, then the investor incurs a capital loss and
the capital loss = purchase price – selling price.
Example 1
Mr. Perera who invests in the stock market, bought 2000 shares in a certain company
when the market price of a share was Rs 20. When the market price of a share
increased to Rs 25, he sold all his shares.
(i) Find the amount Mr. Perera invested in the company.
(ii) Find the amount he made by selling the shares.
(iii) Find his capital gain.
(iv) Express his capital gain as a percentage of his investment.
(i) Amount invested in the company
= Rs 20 2 000
= Rs 40 000
(ii) Amount received by selling the shares = Rs 25 2 000
(iii) Capital gain
= Rs 50 000
= Rs 50 000 – 40 000
= Rs10 000
(iv) The capital gain as a percentage of the =
amount invested
10 0 00
40 000
= 25]
The capital gain percentage mentioned in (iv) above can be calculated using the
price of a share too.
Purchase price of a share = Rs 20
Selling price of a share = Rs 25
... capital gain as a percentage of the amount invested =
25 – 20
= 25]
Example 2
Mr. Mohamed spent a certain amount from the Rs 96 000 he had in hand, to buy
shares at Rs 18 per share, in Company A which pays annual dividends of Rs 2
per share. He spent the remaining amount to buy shares at Rs 21 per share, in
Company B which pays annual dividends of Rs 3.50 per share. At the end of a year
he received Rs 1000 more as annual dividends income from Company B, than the
amount he received from Company A.
(i) By taking the amount that Mr. Mohamed invested in Company A as x,
construct an equation in x.
(ii) Find the amount he invested in each company by solving the above equation.
(iii) Find the number of shares he had in each company.
(iv) Find the annual dividends income he received from each company.
After receiving the annual income, Mr. Mohamed sold all the shares he owns in
both companies at the market price of Rs 20 per share.
(v) Find the total amount he made by selling all his shares in both companies.
(vi) Show that Mr. Mohamed’s expectation of making a profit of 20% on his
original investments through the dividends income and capital gains was
not fulfilled.
Number of shares bought in company A = 18
The annual dividends income from company A = Rs
Similarly,
the annual dividends income from company B = Rs
( 96 000 – x)
( 96 000 – x)
( 96 000 – x)
... = 1000 is the required equation.
( 96 000 – x)
( 96 000 – x)
= 1000
( 96 000 – x)
= 18 1000
3 (96 000 – x ) – 2x = 18 000
288 000 – 3x – 2x = 18 000
288 000 – 18 000 = 5x
270 000 = 5x
x = 54 000
... amount invested in company A is Rs 54 000.
Amount invested in company B = Rs 96 000 – 54 000 = Rs 42 000
(iii) Number of shares owned in company A = 18
54 000
Number of shares owned in company B = 21
42 000
= 3000
= 2000
(iv) Income received from investment in company A = Rs 3000 2 = Rs 6000
Income received from investment in company B = Rs 2000 3.50 = Rs 7000
(v) Amount received by selling shares in company A = Rs 3000 20 = 60 000
Amount received by selling shares in company B = Rs 2000 20 = 40 000
... total amount received by selling the shares
= Rs 60 000 + 40 000
in both the companies
The annual dividends income received from both = Rs 6000 + 7000
companies
= Rs 100 000
... the sum of the amounts received as dividends
income and by selling the shares
= Rs 13 000
= Rs 100 000 + 13 000
= Rs 113 000
Amount invested to buy shares in the
two companies
= Rs 96 000
Profit
= Rs 113 000 – 96 000
= Rs 17 000
... the profit from the investment as a percentage
of the amount invested
17 000
96 000
= 17.7]
Since 17.7% < 20%, Mr. Mohamed’s expectations were not fulfilled.

The Midpoint Theorem
By studying this lesson you will be able to
• understand the midpoint theorem and its converse,
• perform calculations and prove riders using the midpoint theorem and its
converse.
11.1 The Midpoint Theorem
The midpoint theorem is a result related to the lengths of the sides of a triangle.
Let P be the midpoint of the side AB, and Q be the midpoint of the side AC of the
triangle ABC.
Then,
AP = PB and AQ = QC.
This can also be written as AP = PB =
2 AB and AQ = QC =
2 AC.
PQ is the line segment obtained by joining the midpoints of the sides AB and AC.
Theorem
The straight line segment through the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is
parallel to the third side and equal in length to half of it.
In relation to the above figure, according to the theorem,
PQ// BC and
2 BC.
Let us do the following activity to establish this theorem.
Activity 1
Construct the triangle ABC such that AB = 6 cm, BC = 7 cm and CA = 8 cm. Name
the midpoints of AB and AC as P and Q respectively. Join PQ
(i) Measure the length of PQ and establish the fact that it is half the length of BC.
(ii) Check using a set square or by some other method that PQ is parallel to BC.
By doing the above activity, you would have seen that PQ =
2 BC and PQ//BC.
Let us consider through an example how the lengths of the sides of rectilinear plane
figures related to triangles are found using the midpoint theorem.
Example 1

... XY =
2 BC.
... the length of XY is 6 cm.
(ii) The perimeter of BCYX = BC + CY + XY + XB
= 12 + 6 + 6 + 6
... the perimeter of BCYX is 30 cm.

The triangle LMN has been formed by joining
the midpoints L, M and N of the sides PR, PQ
and QR respectively of the triangle PQR. The
triangle ABC has been formed by joining the
midpoints A, B and C of the sides LM, LN and
MN of the triangle LMN. If the perimeter of
the triangle PQR is 12 cm, find the perimeter
of the triangle ABC.
The midpoints of the sides AB and AC of the
triangle ABC in the figure are P and Q
respectively. Show that the areas of the
triangles PBC and BQC are equal.
The perimeter of the square PQRS in the figure is
60 cm. Find the perimeter of the quadrilateral that
is formed by joining the midpoints of the sides of
the square and express it in surd form.
11.2 Proof of the midpoint theorem
Now let us consider the formal proof of the midpoint theorem.
Data: The midpoints of the sides AB and AC of the triangle ABC are P and Q
respectively.
To be proved:
PQ//BC and
2 BC.
Construction: Draw a straight line through C parallel to BP such that it meets PQ
produced at R.
Proof:
In the two triangles APQ and QCR,
AQ = QC (since Q is the midpoint of AC)
QCR (AAS)
(since AP//RC, alternate angles)
(vertically opposite angles)
APQ = QRC
AQP = RQC
... AP = RC and PQ = QR (corresponding sides of congruent triangles)
However, AP = PB
... PB = RC
In the quadrilateral BCRP, PB = RC and PB//RC.
... BCRP is a parallelogram.
... PR = BC and PR//BC.
However, PQ = QR.
... PQ =
2 BC (since PR = BC)
2 BC.
... PQ//BC and PQ =
Now let us consider how riders are proved using the midpoint theorem.
Example 1
M, N and L are the midpoints of the sides AB, BC and CA respectively of the triangle
ABC. Prove that NCLM is a parallelogram.
According to the midpoint theorem, ML=
= NC (since N is the midpoint of BC)
Further, ML//BC.
Therefore, a pair of opposite sides of the quadrilateral NCLM, are equal and parallel.
Therefore, NCLM is a parallelogram.

6. (i) Prove that the quadrilateral that is formed by joining the midpoints of the

(iii) Prove that the quadrilateral that is formed by joining the midpoints of the
sides of a square is a square.
(iv) Prove that the quadrilateral that is formed by joining the midpoints of the
sides of a rhombus is a rectangle.
11.3 Converse of the Midpoint Theorem
Now let us consider the converse of the midpoint theorem.
Theorem:
The straight line through the midpoint of one side of a triangle and parallel to
another side, bisects the third side.
X is the midpoint of the side PQ of the triangle PQR in the figure (that is, PX = XQ).
If XY//QR, according to the converse of the midpoint theorem, Y is the midpoint of
PR. That is, PY = YR.
Do the following activity to establish this theorem.
Activity 2
• Construct the triangle PQR such that PQ = 5 cm, QR = 6 cm and RP = 7 cm.
• Mark the midpoint of the side PQ as X.
• Name the point at which the straight line through X parallel to QR meets the side
PR as Y.
• Measure the lengths of PY and YR and write down the relationship between these
two lengths.
• Similarly, if the straight line through X parallel to PR meets the side QR at Z, write
down the relationship between the lengths of QZ and ZR.
You would have observed by doing the above activity that PY = YR and QZ = ZR.
This establishes the fact that the straight line through the midpoint of one side of a
triangle and parallel to another side, bisects the third side.
Now let us consider some applications of the converse of the midpoint theorem.
Example 1
The bisector of the angle
ADB = 90x . The straight line through D parallel to CA meets the side AB at E.
BAC of the triangle ABC meets the side BC at D.
Prove that
(i) ADB
(ii) BE = EA.
(i) In the triangles ADB and ADC,
(since AD is the bisector of
BAC )
BAD =
AD is the common side
ADB =
(AAS)
BD = DC (corresponding sides of the congruent triangles ADB and ADC)
Since BD = DC and AC // DE, by the converse of the midpoint theorem,
BE = EA.
Example 2
P is the midpoint of the side BC of the triangle ABC
in the figure. The midpoint of AP is Q. BQ produced
meets the side AC at R. The line through P parallel to
BR meets AC at S. If AC = 15 cm, find the length of
In the triangle APS, AQ = QP and QR//PS.
Therefore, according to the converse of the midpoint theorem,
AR = RS
In the triangle BRC, BP = PC and BR//PS.
Therefore, according to the converse of the midpoint theorem,
RS = SC
From 1 and 2 we obtain, AR = RS = SC.
... AS =
= 10.
Therefore, the length of AS is 10 cm.

12.1 Finding the solution to a pair of simultaneous equations
graphically
You have learnt in previous grades how to find the solution to a pair of simultaneous
equations using algebraic methods. We will now consider how the solution to a pair
of simultaneous equations is found by representing the equations graphically.
Let us consider the following pair of simultaneous equations.
y – x = – 3
y + 3x = 5
Let us first solve this pair of simultaneous equations algebraically.
y – x = – 3
y + 3x = 5
2 – 1 gives us,
(y + 3x) – (y – x) = 5 – (– 3)
... y + 3x – y + x = 5 + 3
... 4x = 8
... x = 2
By substituting x = 2 in 1 we obtain,
y – x = – 3
... y = – 3 + 2
... y = – 1
... the solution is
x = 2 and y = – 1.
When these two equations are considered separately, they can be written as
y = x – 3 and y = – 3x + 5 by making y the subject. Let us first draw the graphs of
these straight lines on the same coordinate plane. Two tables of values corresponding
to these equations are given below.
y = x – 3
y = – 3x + 5
– 1 – 4
The graphs of the straight lines
drawn on the same coordinate
plane using the above tables of
values intersect each other at the
point (2, – 1). When the x and y
values corresponding
point are substituted into the
given pair of equations, it can be
observed that the two sides of the
equations are equal. That is, the
coordinates x = 2 and y = – 1 of
the intersection point of these
graphs is the solution to the given
pair of simultaneous equations.
y = x – 3
(2, – 1)
y = – 3x + 5
This geometric solution to the pair of simultaneous equations is further established
by the fact that the same solution was obtained algebraically too.
Accordingly, to find the solution to a pair of simultaneous equations graphically,
the straight lines corresponding to the pair of equations should be drawn on the
same coordinate plane, and the coordinates of the point of intersection of the graphs
should be found. Then the x and y values of the solution are obtained from the
x-coordinate and the y-coordinate respectively of the point of intersection.
In the following example, the method of constructing a pair of simultaneous
equations and solving it graphically is considered.
Example 1
A person buys 10 stamps, some of value Rs 10 and the rest of value Rs 20. The total
value of the stamps is Rs 120.
(i) By taking the number of stamps of value Rs 10 that he bought as x and the
number of stamps of value Rs 20 as y, construct a pair of simultaneous
equations.
(ii) By solving the pair of simultaneous equations graphically, find the number of
Rs 10 stamps and the number of Rs 20 stamps he bought.
The relevant pair of simultaneous equations is as follows.
x + y = 10
10x + 20y = 120
Let us represent each of the equations graphically.
x + y = 10; that is, y = – x + 10
10x + 20y = 120; that is, y = –
x + 6
graphically,
the pair of
equations
x + y = 10 and 10x + 20y = 120 are
represented
intersect each other at the point
(8, 2). Therefore, the solution to the
pair of equations is x = 8 and y = 2.
That is, the person bought eight
Rs 10 stamps and two Rs 20 stamps.
We obtain the following pair of straight lines.
(8, 2)
Exercise 12.1
1. Solve each of the following pairs of simultaneous equations graphically. Verify
your answers by solving the equations algebraically too.
a. y – x = 4
y – 2x = 3
b. y = – 2x – 2
– 2y = – x – 6
c. 3x – 4y = 7
5x + 2y = 3
2. A certain school has two Grade 11 classes A and B. If five students from class A
move to class B, then the number of students in class B will be twice the number
of students in class A. However, if five students from class B move to class A,
then the number of students in the two classes will be equal.
(i) Construct a pair of simultaneous equations by taking the number of students
initially in class A as x and the number of students initially in class B as y.
(ii) Draw the graphs of the pair of equations on the same coordinate plane and
hence find the number of students in class A and in class B separately.

12.2 The graph of a function of the form y = ax2 + bx + c
Let us first consider how we can use the knowledge we have gained on the
characteristics of graphs of quadratic functions of the form y = ax2 + b to study the
characteristics of graphs of quadratic functions of the form y = ax2 + bx + c.
Drawing graphs of functions of the form y = ax2 + bx + c for a > 0 and
identifying their characteristics
To identify some basic characteristics, let us first draw the graph of the function
y = x2 – 2x – 3. To do this, let us prepare a table as follows to obtain the values of y
corresponding to the values of x for – 2 < x < 4.
(x, y) (– 2, 5)
(– 1, 0)
(0, – 3)
(1, – 4)
(2, – 3)
(3, 0)
(4, 5)
Before drawing the graph, it is important to consider the range of values that x and
y take and prepare the coordinate plane accordingly. It is easy to draw the graph of
y = x2 – 2x – 3 by taking 10 small divisions along the x-axis to be one unit and 10
small divisions along the y-axis to be two units as scale.
The graph of a function of the form y = ax2 + bx + c is called a parabola.
We can identify the following characteristics by considering the graph.
• The graph is symmetric about the line x = 1. Therefore, the equation of the axis
of symmetry of the graph is x = 1.
As the value of x increases gradually from – 2, the corresponding y value decreases
gradually until it attains its minimum value – 4 and then starts increasing again.
Let us describe the behaviour of y further for the given range of values of x.
• As the value of x increases from – 2 to – 1, the value of y, that is, the value
of the function decreases positively from 5 to 0. What is meant by “decreases
positively” is that the function decreases while remaining positive.
• The function takes the value 0 when x = – 1.
• As the value of x increases from – 1 to 1, the corresponding y value decreases
negatively from 0 to – 4.
• As the value of x increases from 1 to 3, the corresponding y value increases
negatively from – 4 to 0 .
• The function takes the value 0 when x = 3.
• As the value of x increases from 3, the value of y increases positively.
By considering the above characteristics, the range of values of x for which the
function is negative can be expressed in terms of inequalities as – 1 < x < 3.
• The value of y is positive when the value of x is less than – 1 or greater than 3.
That is, the range of values of x for which the function is positive is x < – 1 and
x > 3.
Let us also pay attention to the following facts.
• It is very important to understand the relationship between the graph that has been
drawn and the function y = x2 – 2x – 3.
This can be described as follows.
(1) If any point (a, b) lies on the graph, then the equation y = x2 – 2x – 3 is satisfied
by x = a and y = b. That is the equation b = a2 – 2a – 3 is true.
(2) Conversely, if x = a and y = b satisfies the equation y = x2 – 2x – 3, then the
point (a, b) lies on the graph of the function y = x2 – 2x – 3.
It is extremely important to keep the above two facts in mind. Clearly the point
(– 1, 0) lies on the graph. Therefore, x = – 1 and y = 0 should satisfy the equation
y = x2 – 2x – 3. That is, 0 = (– 1)2 – 2 (– 1) – 3. This can be verified by simplifying
the right hand side. Another way of stating this is that x = – 1 is a root of the
equation x2 – 2x – 3 = 0. By the same argument it can be stated that x = 3 is also
a root of this equation. That is, the roots of the equation x2 – 2x – 3 = 0 are the x
coordinates of the points at which the graph of y = x2 – 2x – 3 intersects the x- axis.
This can be written more generally as follows.
The x coordinates of the points at which the graph of y = ax2 + bx + c intersects the
x - axis are the roots of the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0.
• The minimum value of the function is obtained at the turning point of the graph.
The minimum value is – 4. The coordinates of the minimum point are (1,– 4).
Drawing the graphs of functions of the form y = ax2 + bx + c for a < 0
and identifying their characteristics
Let us prepare a table as follows for – 4 < x < 2 to draw the graph of the function
y = – x2 – 2x + 6.
(x, y) (– 4, – 2)
(– 3, 3)
(– 2, 6)
(– 1, 7)
(0, 6)
(1, 3)
(2, – 2)
By considering the range of values of x and y, and selecting 10 small divisions
along the x-axis to be one unit and 10 small division along the y axis to be two units
as scale, the graph of the given function can be drawn as follows.
We can identify the following characteristics by considering the graph.
• The graph which has a maximum value 7 is symmetric about the line x = – 1.
• Therefore, the equation of the axis of symmetry of the graph is x = – 1.
• The coordinates of the turning point are (– 1, 7).
• As the value of x increases from – 4 to – 3.6, the value of y increases negatively.
• The function takes the value 0 when x = – 3.6.
• As the value of x increases from – 3.6 to – 1, the corresponding y value increases
positively from 0 to 7.
• The function attains its maximum value of + 7 when the value of x is – 1.
• As the value of x increases from – 1 to + 1.6, the value of the function decreases
positively.
• The function takes the value 0 when x = + 1.6.
• As the value of x increases from + 1.6, the value of y decreases negatively.
• When the value of x lies between – 3.6 and + 1.6, the value of the function is
positive. That is, the range of values of x for which the function is positive is
– 3.6 < x < + 1.6.
• When the value of x is less than – 3.6 or greater than + 1.6, the function is negative.
• That is, the range of values of x for which the function is negative is x < – 3.6 and
x > + 1.6.
• The graph intersects the line y = 0 (x-axis) when x = – 3.6 and x = + 1.6. Therefore,
the values of x which satisfy the equation – x2 – 2x + 6 = 0, that is, the roots of this
equation are x = – 3.6 and x = + 1.6.
• The maximum and minimum values that the function takes when 0 ≤ x ≤ 2, are
6 and – 2 respectively.

12.3 The graph of a function of the form y = + (x + b)2 + c.
y = + (x + b)2 + c is also an equation of a quadratic function. Here the quadratic
function has been expressed in the special form y = + (x + b)2 + c. When it is
written in this form, some of the characteristics of its graph can be inferred without
drawing the graph. Several such characteristic are given in the following table.

To verify the characteristics in the above table, let us consider the following example.
Let us consider the function y = (x + 1)2 – 2. This is of the form y = (x + b)2 + c
where b = 1 and c = – 2. To draw the graph of this function for the values of x from
– 4 to + 2, let us calculate the necessary values of y as shown in the following table.
(x + 1)2
(x, y)
(– 4, 7)
(– 3, 2)
(– 2, – 1)
(– 1, – 2)
(0, – 1)
(1, 2)
(2, 7)
By taking 10 small divisions along the x-axis to be one unit and 10 small divisions
along the y-axis to be two units as scale, the graph of the given function can be
drawn as follows.
Note:
This graph has a minimum point. The minimum value of the function is – 2 (= c).
The coordinates of the minimum point are (– 1, – 2), that is, ( – b, c). The axis of
symmetry is x = – 1 (That is, x = – b).
When a quadratic function has been given in the form x = + (x + b)2 – c, the graph
can be sketched using the characteristics in the above table. The example given
below explains how this is done.
Example 1
Sketch the graph of y = – (x – 2)2 + 3.
Since the coefficient of (x – 2)2 is negative, the turning point of the graph is a
maximum. The coordinates of this maximum point is (2, 3). The axis of
symmetry of the graph is x = 2. Further, to find the point at which the graph
intersects the y-axis, let us substitute x = 0 in y = – (x – 2)2 + 3. We then obtain
y = – (0 – 2)2 + 3 = – 1. Accordingly, we can sketch the graph as follows.

12.4 Graphs of functions of the form y = + (x + a) (x + b)
y = + (x + a) (x + b) is also an equation of a quadratic function. The function has
been written in the special form y = x + (x + a) (x + b). As in the above case, when
the function is given in this form, certain characteristics of the graph of the function
can be inferred without sketching the graph. The following table provides several
such characteristics.

To verify the characteristics in the above table let us consider the following example.
Let us consider y = – (x – 1) (x – 4). This is of the form y = – (x + a) (x + b) where
a = – 1 and b = – 4. To draw the graph of this function, let us prepare a table of
(x, y) values as follows.

By taking 10 small divisions along the x-axis to be one unit and 10 small divisions
along the y-axis to be two units, as scale, the graph of the given function can be
drawn as follows.
Verify as in the example of section 12.3 that this graph has the characteristics given
in the table.
When a quadratic function is given in the form y = + (x + a) (x + b), its graph can
be sketched by considering the characteristics given in the table.
The following example describes how this is done.
Example 1
Sketch the graph of y = – (x + 3) (x – 1).
This is of the form y = – (x + a) (x + b), where a = 3 and b = – 1 Since the coefficient
of x2 is negative, the turning point is a maximum. The points at which the graph
intersects the x-axis are (– 3, 0) and (1, 0). The coordinates of the maximum point
are – a + b
+ (a – b)2

Let us organize this function in the form y = (x + a) (x + b).
The given function can be written as y = (x – 2) (x + 7).
(i) The graph is a parabola with a minimum.
(ii) Since a = – 2 and b = 7, the axis of symmetry is
– (a + b) – (– 2 + 7)
; that is, x = –

(v) The coordinates of the intersection point of the graph and the x-axis are
given by (– a, 0) and (– b, 0); that is, (2, 0) and (– 7, 0).

We have learnt before how to solve a pair of simultaneous equations when the
unknowns have integers as coefficients. Now we will explore through an example,
how to solve a pair of simultaneous equations when the unknowns have fractions
as coefficients.
Example 1
Kamal and Nimal have a certain amount of money. When you add 1
Kamal has to 1
has is equal to 1
separately.
of the amount Nimal has to get Rs 20. If 1
th of what Nimal has, find the amounts Nimal and Kamal have
of the amount
th of what Kamal
Let us see how we can construct a pair of simultaneous equations to solve this
problem.
Let us take the amount Kamal has as
when you add 1
y, you get 1
is, 1
of what Kamal has, that is, Rs 1
x + 1
y. Since this is equal to Rs 20 we get
x and the amount Nimal has as Rs y. Then,
x to 1
of what Nimal has, that
x + 1
y = 20.
1 as one equation.
Similarly , since 1
th of what Kamal has is equal to 1
th of what Nimal has, we get
x = 1
y as the second equation, which can be written as
x – 1
y = 0
When solving simultaneous equations involving fractions, it often helps to first clear
the fractions and work with only integers. To clear the fractions we have to multiply
each side of the equation by the least common multiple of the denominators.
Therefore, equation 1 is multiplied by 6 which is the the least common multiple
of the denominators 2, and 3 and equation 2 is multiplied by 12 which is the least
common multiple of the denominators 6 and 4.
1 6; 6 1
x + 6 1
y = 6 20
2 12; 12 1
∴ 3x + 2y = 120
x – 12 1
y = 12 0
3x – 2y = 0
Now instead of 1 and 2 we can solve the two equivalent equations 3 and 4
involving only integers.
3 + 4 (3x + 2y) + (3x – 2y) = 120 + 0
3x + 2y + 3x – 2y = 120
x = 20
By substituting x = 20 in 4
3 20 – 2y = 0
2y = 60
y = 30
... The amount Kamal has = Rs 20
The amount Nimal has = Rs 30
Note: In this problem, once we converted the fractions into integers, we solved for
the unknown x by adding the equations. Alternatively we can make one unknown
the subject of one equation and substitute in the other equation to obtain the solution.
We will discuss one such example now.
Example 2
Solve.
a – 1
a + 1
b = – 2
b = 9
The following steps will demonstrate how to solve simultaneous equations by
substitution.
Let us make a the subject of equation 1 .
b = – 2
a – 1
a = – 2 + 1
a = – 12 + 6
b (multiplying both sides by 6)
We will substitute the value of a in equation 2 .
a + 1
b) + 1
b + 1
– 4 +
(– 12 +
b = 9
b = 9
b = 9
We will simplify the fractions by taking 20 as the common denominator which is
the least common multiple of 4 and 5.
b = 9 + 4
20 b+ 5
b = 13
13 20
b = 20
Substituting b = 20 in equation 3 (here you can substitute the value of b in either
equation to find a), we get
a = – 12 + 6
a = – 12 + 6
a = – 12 + 24
a = 12
Therefore the solution to the problem is a = 12 and b = 20.
We can verify that the solution is correct by substituting a = 12 and b = 20 in the
original equations.
Let us substitute a = 12 and b = 20 in the left side of equation 1 .
a – 1
b = – 2
Left hand side =
6 a –
6 12 –
= 2 – 4
= – 2
... LHS = RHS
The left hand side equals the right hand side of the equation after the substitution.
That means a = 12 and b = 20 satisfy the equation 1
a – 1
b = – 2
Similarly,
let us substitute a = 12 and b = 20 in the left side of equation 2 .
a + 1
Left hand side =
b = 9
3 a +
3 12 +
= 4 + 5
... LHS = RHS
The left hand side equals the right hand side of the equation after the substitution.
a + 1
That means a = 12 and b = 20 satisfy the equation 1
Therefore we can conclude that we have the correct answer.
b = 9.
Example 3
Solve :
m + 2
m + 1
n = 1
n = 4
Let us take:
m + 2
m + 1
n = 1
n = 4
As in example 1 we can either convert the fractions into integers or we can equate
the fractional coefficients of a variable to solve the problem.
Let us equate the coefficients of the unknown n. We can do this by multiplying
equation 2 by 2
n = 8
2 2 10
3 – 1 (
m + 2
m + 2
n) – (
n) = 8 – 1
n = 7
m + 2
m – 2
m = 7
m = 7
7 m = 7 6
m = 6
n = 1
n = 1
Let us substitute m = 6 in 1 .
m + 2
6 + 2
3 + 2
n = 1 – 3
n = – 2
n = 1
2n = – 6
n = – 3
Therefore the answer is m = 6 and n = – 3.
As in the previous problem, we can verify that the solution is correct by substituting
the answers in the original equations.
Let us substitute m = 6 and n = – 3 in the original equations.
m + 2
n = 1
m + 1
n = 4
Left hand side = 1
= 3 – 2
m + 2
(– 3)
Left hand side = 5
= 5 – 1
(– 3)
∴ Left hand side = Right hand side
∴ Left hand side = Right hand side
Therefore we have the correct answer, m = 6 and n = – 3.
b = 3

13.2 Solving quadratic equations by factoring
You have learnt how to find the solutions (or roots) of a quadratic equation of the
form ax2 + bx + c = 0
Let us review a few a such examples.
Example1
Find the roots of the quadratic equation x2 – 5x + 6 = 0.
(x – 2) (x – 3) = 0 (by factoring)
Then either x – 2 = 0 or x – 3 = 0.
Therefore x = 2 or x = 3
Therefore the roots of the equation are x = 2 and x = 3.
Example 2
Find the roots of 2x2 + 3x – 9 = 0
2x2 + 6x – 3x – 9 = 0
2x (x + 3) – 3 (x + 3) = 0
(2x – 3) (x + 3) = 0 (by factoring)
2x – 3 = 0 or x + 3 = 0
or x = – 3
x = 1
and x = – 3 are the roots of the equation.
Let us look at a more complex example.
Example 3
Find the roots of
2x – 1
3x + 2
Here we cannot see the quadratic equation immediately. But when we clear the
fractions, it can be set up as a quadratic equation. For this, we will consider the
common denominator of the left hand side.(You can also do this by multiplying the
whole equation by the least common multiple of 2x – 1 and 3x + 2)
3(3x + 2) – 2(2x – 1)
(2x – 1) (3x + 2)
= 1 (writing the left hand side as a single fraction)
3(3x + 2) – 2(2x – 1) = (2x – 1) (3x + 2) (cross multiplying)
9x + 6 – 4x + 2 = 6x2 + 4x – 3x – 2 (expanding the factors)
6x2 – 4x – 10 = 0 (simplifying)
3x2 – 2x – 5 = 0 (dividing the whole equation by 2)
3x2 – 5x + 3x – 5 = 0
x (3x – 5) + 1 (3x – 5) = 0
(3x – 5) (x + 1) = 0
... 3x – 5 = 0 or x + 1 = 0
or x = – 1
... x =
... x = 1
or x = – 1
... x = 1
and x = – 1 are the roots of this equation.
Now let us consider a problem that can be solved by means of a quadratic equation.
Example 4
The product of two consecutive integers is 12. Find the two numbers.
Let us see how we can set up a quadratic equation to solve this problem.
Of the two consecutive integers, let us take x to be the smaller integer. Then the
other integer is x + 1.
Therefore the consecutive integers can be written as x, (x + 1) .
Since the product of the two numbers is 12 we get,
x (x + 1) = 12.
... x2 + x – 12 = 0
After factoring we get
(x – 3) (x + 4) = 0.
This is, x – 3 = 0 or x + 4 = 0.
... x = 3 and x = – 4 are the solutions of the above equation.
If we take x = 3 then the consecutive number is (x + 1) = 3 + 1 = 4.
If we take x = – 4 the consecutive number is (x + 1) = – 4 + 1 = – 3.
Therefore there are two pairs of consecutive numbers whose product will be 12.
They are 3, 4 and – 4, – 3.
We can verify the answer by substituting the two pairs of values in the quadratic
equation x2 + x – 12 = 0.
If we substitute x = 3 on the left hand side of x2 + x – 12 = 0,
LHS = x2 + x – 12
= 32 + 3 – 12
= 9 + 3 – 12
= 12 – 12
... LHS = RHS
If we substitute x = – 4 on the left hand side,
LHS = x2 + x – 12
= (– 4)2 + (– 4) – 12
= 16 – 4 – 12
= 16 – 16
... LHS = RHS
Therefore the solutions of the equation x2 + x – 12 = 0 are indeed 3 and – 4.
Example 5
The area of a rectangular plot of land is 150 square metres. The length of the plot is
5 metres more than the width. Let x be the width of the plot.
(i) Write the length of the plot in terms of x.
(ii) Set up a quadratic equation in x to represent the area of the plot x.
(iii) Solve the equation to find the length and the width of the plot.
(i) Length = x + 5.
(ii) The given data can be shown more clearly by aid of a drawing.
150 m2
x + 5
Area = length width
= (x + 5) x
x (x + 5) = 150
This is the required equation.
(iii) Let us solve the above equation.
x (x + 5) = 150
x2 + 5x – 150 = 0
(x – 10) (x + 15) = 0
... x – 10 = 0 or x + 15 = 0
... x = + 10 or x = – 15
The roots of the quadratic equation are x = + 10 and x = – 15.
But since a length cannot be negative, the only acceptable answer is x = 10.
Therefore the width of the rectangular plot = 10 m
The length of the rectangular plot = 15 m
We can verify the answer by substituting x = 10 in the quadratic equation
x2 + 5x – 150 = 0.
LHS = x (x + 5)
= 10 (10 + 5)
= 10 15
= 150
... LHS = RHS

13.3 Solving a quadratic equation by completing the square
We have seen how to solve a quadratic equation by factorization. This method is
useful only when the factorization is easy to do. Many quadratic expressions, such
as x2 + 3x + 5 = 0 and 2x2 – 5x –1 = 0 cannot be factorized easily.To solve such
quadratic equations we have to use alternative methods.One such method is to
arrange the quadratic as a perfect square. This is known as solving the quadratic
equation by completing the square.
Before we proceed, let us recall how we learnt to write an expression of the form
x2 + bx as a perfect square.
Activity
Write the constant you should include to convert each of the following expressions
into a perfect square and write it as a perfect square.
a. x2 + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)2
b. x2 + 8x + ... = ............
c. x2 – 14x + ... = ............
d. x2 + 3x + ... = ............
e. (x + ...)2 = x2 + 8x + ...
f. (x + ...)2 = x2 + 2ax + ...
g. (x + b)2 = x2 + ...x + b2
h. (x + m)2 = x2 + ...x + m2
First we will complete the square of a quadratic equation which can also be solved
by factoring.
Example 1
Solve x2 + 2x – 3 = 0 by completing the square.
First we will keep all terms containing x on one side and move the constant to the
right. Then we get
x2 + 2x – 3 = 0
x2 + 2x = 3
To write the left hand side as a perfect square, take half of the x-term coefficient
and square it and add this value to both sides. That is, in this problem we have to
add +1 to both sides.
x2 + 2x + 1 = 3 + 1
(x + 1)2 = 4
Take the square root of both sides. We have to allow for both positive and negative
values.
x + 1 = + 4
x + 1 = + 2
x = + 2 – 1
Then x = + 2 – 1 or x = – 2 – 1
x = 1 or x = – 3
Therefore the solutions to the above equation are x = 1 and x = – 3.
Now let us look at another example.
Example 2
Solve x2 – 4x + 1 = 0 by completing the square.
x2 – 4x + 1 = 0
x2 – 4x – 1
x2 – 4x + 4 = – 1 + 4
(x – 2)2 = 3
x – 2 = + 3 ^taking the square root of both sides)
x = 2 + 3
x = 2 + 3 or x = 2 – 3.
Suppose it is given that 3 is approximately 1.73
Then x = 2 + 1.73 or x = 2 – 1.73
x = 3.73 or x = 0.27
Then the solutions of this equation are x = 3.73 and x = 0.27.
Example 3
Find the roots of 2x2 + 6x – 5 = 0 by completing the square.
Here it is easy if we first divide all the terms by 2 to make the leading coefficient
(coefficient of the x2 term) one.
= 0 (now the leading coefficient is one)
2x2 + 6x – 5 = 0
x2 + 3x –
x2 + 3x =
+10 + 9
x2 + 3x +
x + 3
= + 19
+ 19 – 3
or x =
– 19 – 3
Suppose 4.36 is given as an approximate value of 19 .
Then x =
4.36 – 3
or x =
– 4.36 – 3
x = 0.68 or x = – 3.68
The roots of the equation are x = 0.68 and x = – 3.68.

57 = 7.54)
(a) x2 – 2x – 4 = 0
(b) x2 + 8x – 2 = 0
(c) x2 – 6x = 4
(d) x2 + 4x – 8 = 0
(g) 2x2 + 5x = 4
(e) x ( x + 8) = 8
(h) 3x2 = 3x +
(f) x2 + x = 4

13.4 Solving quadratic equations by using the quadratic formula
An easy method of solving a quadratic equation of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0 is by
using the quadratic formula.
The quadratic formula is derived by completing the square on a general quadratic
equation ax2 + bx + c = 0.
Once the quadratic formula is derived, it is no longer necessary to use the process
of completing the square to solve "each" quadratic equation.
ax2 + bx + c = 0
ax2 + bx = – c

Then x + b

Therefore
to solve a quadratic equation of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0
we can use the quadratic formula
b2 – 4ac
We get two values (roots) for x due to the positive and negative signs.
Here a is the coefficient of x2
b is the coefficient of x and
c is the constant term.
Example 1
Solve 2x2 + 7x + 3 = 0 by using the quadratic formula.
To solve the equation 2x2 + 7x + 3 = 0, we can take a = 2, b = 7 and c = 3 and
substitute these values in the quadratic formula x =

Equiangular Triangles
By studying this lesson you will be able to
• understand the meaning of equiangular and similar figures,
identify the theorem “A line drawn parallel to a side of a triangle, divides the
other two sides proportionally”,
identify the converse theorem “If a straight line divides two sides of a triangle
proportionally then that line is parallel to the remaining side”,
identify the theorem “Corresponding sides of equiangular triangles are
proportional”,
identify the converse theorem “If the corresponding sides of two triangles are
proportional then those triangles are equiangular”.
Ratios of lengths
The figure illustrates the line segment AB. The point C lies on AB such that
AC = 2 cm and CB = 3 cm. Point C divides AB into two line segments AC and CB.
Then, the ratio of AC to CB can be written using their lengths as follows.
AC : CB = 2 : 3
AC : AB = 2 : 5
CB : AC = 3 : 2
CB : AB = 3 : 5.
Similarly
hence
(since AB = 5cm)
The ratio of the lengths of line segments should be written in the order of the line
segments relevant to that ratio.
Consider the triangle ABC in the following figure.
As shown in the figure, the points P, Q and R lie on each side of the triangle ABC.
Then the ratios can be written as follows.
(i) AP : PB = 2 : 3, AP : AB = 2 : 5, PB : AP = 3 : 2
(ii) AQ : QC = 1 : 5, AQ : AC = 1 : 6, QC : AQ = 5 : 1
(iii) BR : RC = 3 : 3 = 1 : 1, BR : BC = 3 : 6 = 1 : 2
We have already learnt that ratios can be written as fractions.
Therefore AQ : QC = 1 : 5 can be also written as AQ
= 0.2
14.1 Dividing two sides of a triangle by a line drawn parallel to
the other side
Let us do the following activity to find out about the ratios in which two sides of a
triangle are divided by a line drawn parallel to the other side.
Activity
• Draw a triangle ABC with AB = 6cm and choosing any length for the other two
sides.
• Mark the points P and Q on AB such that AP = 2 cm and AQ = 3 cm.
• Using the set square or using any other method, draw a line through Q parallel to
BC and name the point that it meets the line AC as R.
• Measure AR and RC.
• Similarly draw another line parallel to BC through P and mark the point that it
meets the line AC as S.
• Measure AS and SC.
• Now complete the following table.

• Similarly check the relationship between the ratios in which the two sides of
a right angled triangle and obtuse angled triangle are divided by a line drawn
parallel to the other side.
Check whether your results agree with the following sentence.
A line drawn parallel to one side of a triangle divides the other two sides in
equal ratios.
The above result can be given as a theorem in geometry.
Theorem:
A line drawn parallel to a side of a triangle divides the other two sides
proportionally.
As an example, the line AB drawn parallel to the side PR of the triangle PQR is
shown in the figure.
Then according to the theorem,
(i) QA : AP = QB : BR hence,
Figure (i)
Figure (ii)
Figure (iii)
As shown in figure (i), the line PQ drawn parallel to BC internally divides the
sides AB and AC. But in figure (ii) and figure (iii), the line PQ, drawn parallel to
BC meets other two sides produced at P and Q. In these kinds of situations, it is
said that PQ externally intersects AB and BC. Irrespective of whether the sides are
divided internally or externally, the theorem is valid.
Hence for all three figures above,
Now consider the following examples with calculations using the theorem.
Example 1
In triangle PQR, the line XY is drawn parallel to PR. Find the length of RY if
PX = 4 cm, XQ = 2 cm, and YQ = 3 cm.
Let x be the length of RY.
Then, since XY is drawn parallel to PR,
according to the theorem
hence
... 2x = 4 3
... x = 6
... The length of RY is 6 cm.
Example 2
Based on the information given in the figure, find the values of a and b.
10 cm
Let us join BE first.
In triangle BED, as DE//CX, according to the theorem, CX divides the sides BD
and BE proportionally.
Hence,
Hence,
Now, in triangle BGE, as BG//XF, according to the theorem, XF divides the sides
EB and EG proportionally.
Hence,
From 1 and 2
Hence, 4a = 50
... a =
= 12.5 cm
Similarly, let us join AF.
In triangle ACF,
In triangle AHF,
From 3 and 4 ,
hence 5b = 32
... b =
= 6.4 cm
Now establish what was learnt by doing the calculations in the following exercise.

14.2 More on dividing two sides of a triangle proportionally
In this section let us consider how riders are proved using the theorem “A line
drawn parallel to a side of a triangle divides the other two sides proportionally”
Example 1
In the given figure, PQRS and PAB are straight lines. BS//AR and BR//AQ.
Prove that PQ : QR = PR : RS.
Proof: In the triangle PBR, as AQ is parallel to BR, according to the theorem,
PA : AB = PQ : QR
In the triangle PBS as AR is parallel to BS, according to the theorem
PA : AB = PR : RS
From 1 and 2
PQ : QR = PR : RS
Example 2
The point D lies on the side BC of the triangle ABC. The line BE drawn parallel to
AC meets AD produced at E. The line drawn from D, parallel to AB meets AC at P.
Prove that CP : AP = AD : DE.
Here, as in the above example, choose two triangles and in each triangle draw a
line parallel to a relevant side of the triangle. We choose triangles ABE and ABC,
because there is a common side to these two triangles.
But there is no line parallel to a side of the ABC triangle. Therefore let us construct
such a line.
Construction: Draw line DQ parallel to BE such that it meets AB at Q. (Then AC,
QD, and BE are parallel to each other)
Proof :
In the triangle ABC, PD is parallel to AB. Therefore by the theorem,
In the triangle ABC, QD is parallel to AC. Therefore by the theorem,
CP : PA = CD : DB
In the triangle ABE, QD is parallel to BE. Therefore by the theorem,
AQ : QB = CD : DB
AQ : QB = AD : DE
From the equations 1 " 2 and 3
CP : PA = CD : DB = AQ : QB = AD : DE.
CP : PA = AD : DE
Exercise 14.2
1. Based on the information in the figure, show that
OA : AB = OE : EF.
2. Based on the given information in the figure,
prove that AC : CE = BD : DF.
3. Based on the given information in the figure,
prove that AP : AB = BR : BC.
4. In triangle PQR, the point A lies on QR. A line drawn through A, parallel to PR,
meets PQ at B. The line RCD drawn from R, intersects AB at C and PQ at D. If
= BCD
then prove that
14.3 The converse of the theorem “a line drawn parallel to a side
of a triangle divides the other two sides proportionally ”
The above theorem says that, in triangle ABC, a line drawn parallel to BC divides
AB and AC in equal ratios.
That is, since BC//DE, AD : DB = AE : EC. Let us understand the converse of this
theorem by considering the triangle PQR shown in the figure.
Here the line AB intersects the sides PQ and PR. The ratios of the line segments of
each side are PA : AQ and PB : BR.
If these two ratios are equal, that is, if PA : AQ = PB : BR then the line AB, which
intersects those two sides at P and Q, is parallel to the other side QR. This is the
converse of the theorem we have already learnt in this lesson. This result can be
stated as a theorem.
The converse of the above theorem:
If a line divides two sides of a triangle proportionally, then that line is
parallel to the other side.
Given below are some examples with calculations and proved riders related to the
theorem.
Example 1
4.5 cm
Based on the information in the figure, find the value of AX : XF.
Consider the triangle ABC. Then, AD : DB = 4 : 3 and
AE : EC = 6 : 4.5 = 4 : 3.
... AD : DB = AE : EC
... The line DE divides AB and AC proportionally.
... By the converse of the theorem, DE//BC.
Therefore in triangle ABF, since DX//BF,
AD : DB = AX : XF
But AD : DB = 4 : 3
Hence AX : XF = 4 : 3
Example 2
The point P lies on the side AB of the quadrilateral ABCD. The line drawn through
P, parallel to AC, meets BC at Q. Similarly, the line drawn through P, parallel to
AD, meets BD at R. Prove that RQ//DC.
Proof :
In triangle ABD, since PR is parallel to the side AD,
BP : PA = BR : RD
In triangle ABC, since PQ is parallel to the side AC,
BP : PA = BQ : QC
From equations 1 and 2
BR : RD = BQ : QC.
... In triangle BDC, the line RQ divides the sides BD and BC proportionally.
... RQ//DC (by the converse theorem)
For the following exercises use the converse theorem given above.

4. In the quadrilateral ABCD given in the figure, the
diagonals AC and BD intersect at K. If AK = 4.8 cm,
KC = 3.2 cm, BK = 3 cm and KD = 2 cm, then show
that DC is parallel to AB.(Hint: In triangle KDC, take
that the points A and B lie on DK and CK produced
respectively.)
5. In the triangle ABC given in the figure, the midpoint
of the side BC is D. The point O lies on AD. BO
produced intersects AC at P and CO produced
intersects AB at Q. The line AD is produced to R
such that OD = DR. Prove that,
(i) BRCO is a parallelogram.
(ii) AQ : QB = AO : OR.
(iii) QP//BC.
14.4 Similar figures and equiangular figures
Carefully observe the following three triangles.
In day to day language we say that these three triangles are of the "same shape".
The following figure illustrates three quadrilaterals and three pentagons of the same
shape.
But the following pair of triangles as well as pair of quadrilaterals are not of the
same shape.
Did you think of what is meant by "shape" here? In mathematics things should be
defined precisely. It is necessary to give a precise definition for —shape˜. —Similar
figure˜ is the phrase in mathematics equivalent to —same shape˜ in day to day
language. Here we consider only the similarity of polygons.
Two polygons are said to be similar if;
1. the angles of one polygon are equal to the angles of the other and,
2. the corresponding sides of the polygons are proportional.
As an example, consider the following two quadrilaterals ABCD and PQRS.
In these two quadrilaterals,
then the quadrilaterals ABCD and PQRS are similar.
In this lesson we hope to study more about similar triangles.
In the two triangles ABC and PQR given below,
RP , then by definition the two triangles are similar.
There is an important result related to the similarity of triangles. That is, if the
angles of one triangle are equal to the angles of another triangle, then those two
triangles are similar. In otherwords, if three angles of a triangle are equal to the three
angles of another triangle then the corresponding sides of those two triangles are
proportional. Therefore to find out whether two triangles are similar, it is sufficient
to check only the angles of the two triangles. As an example, in the above two
triangles, if A
and C
, then
This result is not true for polygons which are not triangles. For example, in the
following two quadrilaterals, the angles of one quadrilateral are equal to the
angles of the other quadrilateral. Each of these angles is 90x. However one of the
quadrilaterals is a rectangle and the other is a square. Therefore their sides are not
proportional and hence the two quadrilaterals are not similar.
If the angles of two polygons are equal, then those polygons are said to be equiangular.
According to the above discussion, two equiangular triangles are similar too. Let us
use this result as a theorem without proof.
Theorem on equiangular triangles:
If two triangles are equiangular then the corresponding sides are
proportional.
Do the following activity to understand more about this result.
Activity
² Using the protractor, draw two different sized triangles, each with interior angles
x, 50x and 90x . As shown below, name the triangles as ABC and PQR .
² Find the ratios(as fractions) between the corresponding sides of the two triangles.
That is, find the values of
QR and
RP separately.
² Check whether these three values are equal.(You can have minor errors because
of errors in the measurements)
According to the above activity, you can understand that if two triangles are
equiangular then they are similar.
Note:
1.If restricted to triangles, similar and equi-angular mean the same thing.
2.It is clear that two congruent triangles are similar. But two similar triangles may
not be congruent.
3. If two angles of one triangle are equal to two angles of another triangle, then
the remaining pair of angles are also equal to each other. The reason for this is
because the sum of the three angles of a triangle is equal to 180x. Therefore, if
two angles of one triangle are equal to two angles of another triangle, then they
are equiangular.

Next we investigate the converse of the above theorem. That is, to find whether
the statement "if the sides of two triangles are proportional then those triangles are
equiangular" is true .This converse is true and we can state this result as a theorem.
Also, if the three sides of a triangle are proportional to the three sides of another
triangle then the two triangles are said to be similar.
Do the following activity to understand this result further.
Activity
² Construct the triangle ABC with AB = 2.5 cm, BC = 3 cm and AC = 3.5 cm.
² Construct the triangle PQR with PQ = 5 cm, QR = 6 cm and PR = 7 cm.
² Observe the relationship between the values
² Measure the angles of each triangles separately.
² What type of triangles are ABC and PQR?
Through this activity you may have observed that the corresponding sides of the
two triangles are proportional and also that the angles of ABC are equal to the
angles of PQR.
This result can be expressed as the converse theorem of the theorem which we
learnt about equiangular triangles earlier.
Theorem: If the three sides of a triangle are proportional to the three sides
of another triangle, then the two triangles are equiangular.
Example 1

triangles ABC and PQR are equiangular. Name the equal angles.

Data Representation and
Interpretation
By studying this lesson, you will be able to
² find the limits and boundaries of the intervals of a frequency distribution
² draw the relevant histogram
² draw the relevant frequency polygon
² draw the relevant cumulative frequency curve and find the inter quartile
range from that curve
Limits and boundaries of class intervals
The following is data of the heights (to the nearest centimetre) of 30 students
137, 135, 141, 147, 151, 135, 137, 143, 144, 145
140, 134, 141, 140, 153, 144, 133, 138, 155, 130
136, 137, 142, 143, 145, 143, 154, 146, 148, 158
We know that the range is the value which is obtained by subtracting the least value
of the data from the highest value of the data. Therefore,
The range of the data = 158 – 130
To facilitate interpretation, a group of data is often represented as a frequency
distribution. We know that if the range of the data is large, then the data is divided
into class intervals. Such a frequency distribution is called a grouped frequency
distrbution. In such frequency distributions, generally, the number of class intervals
should be between 5 and 10. The size of a class interval is determined by dividing
the range of the frequency distribution by the number of class intervals and taking
the least integer greater than that value .
For example let us group the above data into 6 class intervals. To find the size of a
class interval, first divide 28 (the range) by 6 (number of class intervals).
then, we obtain
6 4.66 '
Hence the size of each interval should be 5, which is the least integer greater than
4.66.
Next the first class interval needs to be selected. Since the lowest value of the data
is 130, the first class interval should start from 130.
The following are two different grouped frequency distributions from the given
data.
Class intervals Frequency
Class intervals Frequency
130 -135
135 - 140
140 - 145
145 - 150
150 - 155
155 - 160
130 -134
135 - 139
140 - 144
145 - 149
150 - 154
155 - 159
First grouped distribution
Second grouped distribution
Consider the first grouped distribution. As an example, the 130 - 135 class interval
represents the heights greater than or equal to 130 and less than 135. The second
class interval 135 - 140 represents the heights greater than or equal to 135 and less
than 140. The other class intervals can be described similarly.
Now consider the second grouped distribution. As an example, the 130 - 134 class
interval represents the heights greater than or equal to 130 and less than or equal
to 134.
Let us observe another difference between these two distributions. In the first
distribution there are no gaps between the class intervals. For example, the class
interval 135 - 140 starts from the upper limit 135 of the previous class interval
130 - 135. So there is a common limit for these class intervals. But this is not so
in the second distribution. For example 134 is the upper limit of the class interval
130-134, but the next class interval starts from 135. The gap between these two
limits is 1.
In the next section of this lesson we hope to learn how to draw histograms. To draw
a histogram, there should not be these kinds of gaps. Therefore we must change
the second distribution appropriately. This change can be done by introducing a
common boundary for the class intervals. That common boundary can be determined
easily.
For example, in the second distribution, 134.5 is taken as the boundary of the class
intervals 130 - 134 and 135 - 139, which is the exact middle of the upper limit
(134) of the class interval 130 - 134 and the lower limit (135) of the class interval
135 - 139.The new distribution constructed in this way is given below.
Class intervals with boundaries
Frequency
129.5 - 134.5
134.5 - 139.5
139.5 - 144.5
144.5 - 149.5
149.5 - 154.5
154.5 - 159.5
Here observe that, 0.5 is subtracted from the lower limits and 0.5 is added to the
upper limits of every class interval of the original distribution.This rule is valid for
the first and last class intervals too. The values 129.5 and 159.5 are obtained in that
way. Also observe that, the size of the class interval of this new distribution is 5.
In the above, the first kind of distribution is simple. But practically, the second kind
of distribution can be constructed easily. Both kinds of distributions can be found
in statistics.
15.1 Histogram of a grouped frequency distribution
Let us consider how to draw the histogram of a grouped frequency distribution. A
histogram is a graphical representation of a grouped frequency distribution. In a
histogram, the frequencies of class intervals are represented by the heights of the
rectangular columns which touch each other. Let us consider first, how to draw
the histogram if the sizes of the class intervals are equal.(As in the example in the
previous section).
When drawing the histogram, follow the steps given below.
² Mark the boundaries of the calss intervals on the horizontal axis drawn to an
appropriate scale.
² Along the vertical axis, on an appropriate scale, draw the columns such that the
height of the column on a class interval is the corresponding frequency.
By considering the following example, let us observe how to draw the histogram.
Example 1
Draw the histogram of the grouped frequency distribution prepared in the previous
section.
For this, let us consider the second frequency distribution.
Intervals with boundaries
Frequency
129.5 - 134.5
134.5 - 139.5
139.5 - 144.5
144.5 - 149.5
149.5 - 154.5
154.5 - 159.5
The relevant histogram is given below.
Two small squares along the horizontal axis represents 1 centimetre.
Five small squares along the vertical axis represents two children.
129.5

Observe here that the columns touch each other.
Note: Since the data starts from 129.5, it is not necessary to show the class
intervals from 0 to 129.5 in the histogram. The mark
at the beginning of the x
axis indicates that the axis has been shrunk in this region.
Example 2
The following is a frequency distribution of the Mathematics marks of students
taken from a School Based Assessment.
Class intervals
(Marks Obtained)
Frequency
(Number of children)
0 - 10
10 - 20
20 - 30
30 - 40
40 - 50
As an example, the interval 0 - 10 represents the marks greater than or equal to 0
and less than 10. The other class intervals are defined similarly. Draw the histogram
of the frequency distribution.
In this frequency distribution, the first class interval ends at 10 and next class
interval starts at 10.This histogram can be drawn easily.
20 30
40 50
Marks Obtained
Now let us consider how to draw a histogram of a frequency distribution with
different sized class intervals.
Example 3
A frequency distribution based on the marks of 40 students in a term test is given
below.
Class intervals
(Marks Obtained)
Frequency
(Number of students)
0 - 10 10 - 20 20 - 30 30 - 40 40 - 50 50 - 70 70 - 100
If you observe the class intervals, you can see that the sizes of the class intervals
are not the same. The size of each of the first 5 class intervals is 10 and the sizes of
the next two class intervals are 20 and 30 respectively. Another important feature
in a histogram is that the areas of the columns are proportional to the relevant
frequencies.
Therefore if the sizes of the class intervals are equal, then the frequencies are
proportional to the heights of the columns. Hence in the above examples 1 and
2, the frequency can be identified directly with the height of the column. But in
this example, since the sizes of the class intervals are not the same, the frequency
cannot be identified directly with the height of the column. The heights of the
columns should be obtained such that the areas of the columns are proportional to
the frequences. This can be done as follows.
In this frequency distribution, the size of all but the class intervals 50 - 70 and
70 - 100 is 10. The size of the class interval 50 - 70 is 20 and the size of the class
interval 70 - 100 is 30.
Hence the size of the smallest class interval is 10 and the size of the class interval
50 - 70 is two times that. Since the area of the column which represents the frequency
of the class interval should be proportional to the frequency,
frequency
Height of the column =
... The height the column of the 50 - 70 class interval =
The size of the class interval 70 - 100 is three times the size of the smallest class
interval.
... The height the column of the 70 - 100 class interval =
After these calculations, the histogram can be drawn as follows.

15.2 Frequency polygon
A frequency polygon is a graphical representation of grouped data similar to a
histogram. There are two methods to construct frequency polygons.
² From the histogram of the frequency distribution
² From the mid-values and frequencies of the class intervals
In the following example, let us consider first, how to construct a frequency polygon
from the histogram.
Example 1
Let us consider a frequency distribution used in a previous example.
Marks
0 - 10
10 - 20 20 - 30 30 - 40
40 - 50
Number of students
(i) First draw the histogram relevant to the given information
(ii) In each column in the histogram, mark the sign — ˜ at the middle of the top of
the column. (See the following figure; the signs — ˜ denoted as A, B, C, D and
(iii) Join these — ˜signs by the line segments as shown in the figure.
(iv) On the horizontal axis, mark half the length of the class interval to the right of
the last class interval and to the left of the first class interval (hence 5 units)'
Join E F and A G.
Marks
Now you get the polygon ABCDEFG. This polygon is called the frequency polygon
of the frequency distribution. If you observe carefully, you can see that the area
of the frequency polygon is equal to the sum of the areas of the columns of the
histogram.
To draw a frequency polygon, it is not necessary to draw the histogram first. The
frequency polygon can be drawn directly by using the mid-values of the class
intervals and using the relevant frequencies. The following example shows how to
draw the frequency polygon using this method.
Example 2
From the given frequency distribution, prepare a table with the mid-values of the
class intervals to draw the frequency polygon.
Class interval

10 - 20
20 - 30
30 - 40
40 - 50
Mid-value
Frequency
Mark the mid-values of the class intervals along the horizontal axis and mark
the frequencies along the vertical axis. Then mark the corresponding points. The
frequency polygon can be obtained by joining those points respectively by line
segments.
Marks
Let us consider next, how to draw a frequency polygon with unequal sized class
intervals.

unequal sized class intervals.
The relevant frequency polygon is given below'

90 100 110
Here, the class interval 50 - 60 of size 20 is divided in to two class intervals of
size 10 and as the relevant frequency, the frequency of the mid-point of each class
interval is considered. Similarly the class interval 70 - 100 of size 30 is divided in
to three class intervals of size 10 and as the relevant frequency, the frequency of
the mid-point of each class interval is considered. Also in this case, observe that
the area of the frequency polygon is equal to the sum of the areas of columns of the
histogram.

(ii) Use this histogram to draw the frequency polygon.
15.3 Cumulative frequency curve of a grouped frequency
distribution
This is a another method of representing data of a frequency distribution
graphically.
Let us see how to draw the cumulative frequency curve by considering the following
example
Example 1
The following is a frequency distribution of the marks in Mathematics of 32 students
in a class. Let us draw its cumulative frequency curve.
Marks
0 - 10
10 - 20 20 - 30 30 - 40
40 - 50
Number of students
Let us construct a cumulative frequency table from the above table.
Class intervals
Frequency Cumulative
0 - 10
10 - 20
20 - 30
30 - 40
40 - 50
frequency
The word "cumulative" means "increasing by addition". For example, in the above
table, the cumulative frequency relevant to the class interval 20-30 is the sum of
all frequencies less than in the intervals up to the class mark 30. (In other words
no. of students whose marks are less than 30) That is equal to 20. The cumulative
frequency relevant to the class interval 40 - 50 is the number of students whose
marks are less than 50. That is 32, the total number of students. After completing
this table, to draw the cumulative frequency curve, all the points corresponding to
the upper limit of each class interval via the relevant cumulative frequency should
be marked. These points should be joined smoothly, as shown below.
Upper limit of class intervals
15.4 Quartiles and interquartile range of a frequency distribution
In previous sections, we learnt how to construct a histogram, frequency polygon
and cumulative frequency curve from a group of data. These are useful to get an
idea about how far the data disperses centrally. For example, just by looking at the
histogram, the modal class of a grouped frequency distribution can be decided.
Similarly, an idea on how far the data disperses symmetrically can also be obtained.
In this section, we hope to learn about quartiles and the interquartile range of a
group of data. From this we can get some idea about the dispersion of data.
The first thing to do to find quartiles and the interquartile range is to organize the
data in ascending order. After that the first quartile (Q1), the second quartile (Q2)
and the third quartile (Q3) can be found as follows.
Step 1:
First find the median of the data. This is the second quartile.
Step 2:
Step 3:
Find the median of the data to the left of the second quartile. This is the
first quartile.
Find the median of the data to the right of the second quartile. This is the
third quartile.
As an example, consider the following group of data which is in ascending order.
Example 1
5, 6, 6, 8, 11, 12, 12, 12, 13, 14, 14, 14, 17, 18, 20, 24, 25, 26, 30
Here,there are 19 data. The median of these is 14 (It is in the square)
5, 6, 6, 8, 11, 12, 12, 12, 13, 14, 14, 14, 17, 18, 20, 24, 25, 26, 30
Now consider the data left of the median.
5, 6, 6, 8, 11, 12, 12, 12, 13
The median of that part is 11. That is also in the square.
At last, consider the data right of the median. '
14, 14, 17, 18, 20, 24, 25, 26, 30
The median of that part is 20. That is also in a square.
Hence,
first quartile = Q1 = 11
second quartile = Q2= 14
third quartile = Q3= 20.
Example 2
Let us find the quartiles of the following 18 data written in ascending order .
2, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 11, 11, 12, 12, 15, 15, 16, 17, 20
2, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 11, 11, 12, 12, 15, 15, 16, 17, 20
Its median is the mean of the 8 and 11 in the rectangle.
Hence,
8 + 11
The left side of the median is:
2, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8
The median of that is 6. It is in the square.
Hence Q1= 6.
At last, the right side of the median is:
11, 11, 12, 12, 15, 15, 16, 17, 20
The median of that is 15. It is in the square.
Hence Q3= 15.
Example 3
There are 17 data in the following data string. Find the quartiles.
102, 104, 104, 105, 107, 107, 107, 108, 112, 112, 113, 115, 115, 119, 120, 125, 126
The heads of the arrows indicate the quartiles which are calculate according to the
above steps.
102, 104, 104, 105, 107, 107, 107, 108, 112, 112, 113, 115, 115, 119, 120, 125, 126
105 + 107
105 + 107
Q2 = 112
115 + 119
115 + 119
Example 4
There are 16 data in the following data string. Observe how to calculate the quartiles
which are indicated by the heads of arrows.
21, 23, 25, 25, 26, 28, 28, 30, 30, 34, 34, 35, 37, 37, 40, 42
Hence, Q1=
25 + 26
25.5,
30 + 30
35 + 37
In statistics, there are several methods to find quartiles of a data string. The method
described here is the most practical and the most convenient method.
Another method to calculate quartiles is, finding the locations of the quartiles using
the formulae
Q1 in the
(n + 1) position, Q2 in the
(n + 1) position, Q3 in the
(n + 1) position.
For example, consider the data string 4 6 7 8 15 18 20.
In this data string, according to the formulae,
Q1 is located at the place
Q2 is located at the place
(7 + 1)
= 2. Hence Q1 = 6.
(7 + 1)
= 4' Hence Q2 = 8.
Q3 is located at the place
As another example, consider the data string 9 12 18 20 21 23 24 26.
In this data string, according to the formulae,
= 6' Hence Q3 = 18.
(7 + 1)
Q1 is located at the place
Q2 is located at the place
(8 + 1)
(8 + 1)
= 2. 25. Hence Q1 = 12 + 1
= 4.5. Hence Q2 = 20 + 21
= 6.75. Hence Q3 = 23 + 3
(18 – 12) = 13.5
Q3 is located at the place
(8 + 1)
(24 – 23) = 23.75
Here, when using different methods from each other, different answers with small
deviations may be obtained. But this is not a problem since in methods of statistics
it is expected to get approximate values.
The interquartile range of a group of data is the value obtained by subtracting the
first quartile from the third quartile.
Hence Interquartile range = Q3 – Q1
Exercise 15.4
1. The following are ages of 17 workers in a work place prepared in ascending
order.
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 27, 30, 34, 35, 40, 41, 42, 44, 46, 47, 50
For this group of data, find the following.
(i) Median
(ii) First quartile
(iii) Third quartile
(iv) Interquartile range.
2. The number of members in the families of the students in a class is given below.

Prepare this group of data in ascending order and find the following.
(i) Median
(ii) First quartile
(iii) Third quartile
(iv) Interquartile range.

(ii) First quartile
(iii) Third quartile
(iv) Interquartile range.
More on Interquartile Range
In this section, we hope to learn how to find quartiles and the interquartile range of
grouped data. Here we describe only, how to find it using the cumulative frequency
curve. Let us consider how to find quartiles and the interquartile range of grouped
data from the following example.
Example 1
The following is a frequency distribution prepared from the Mathematics marks of
a group of students in grade 11. Let us draw the cumulative frequency curve for this
frequency distribution.
Marks
0 - 10 10 - 20 20 - 30 30 - 40 40 - 50 50 - 60 60 - 70 70 - 80
No. of students
Let us construct a table from this data to draw the cumulative frequency curve.
Class intervals Frequency
0 - 10
10 - 20
20 - 30
30 - 40
40 - 50
50 - 60
60 - 70
70 - 80
Cumulative frequency
Let us draw the cumulative frequency curve as learnt in section 15.3.
(0, 39)
(0, 26)
(0, 13)
(26, 0)
(42, 0) (55, 0)
Now let us pay attention to the vertical lines and the horizontal lines in the above
figure of the cumulative frequency curve.
Here the total number of data is 52. That is, the sum of the frequencies is 52. Let
us first find, the locations of the first, second and third quartiles of those 52 data.
Note: When finding the quartiles from the cumulative frequency curve, there is
no need to do it as in setion 15.5. Since the number of data is large (More than 30
data values is considered as a large number of data), it is sufficient to locate the
positions of 1
of the frequencies.
of the frequencies and 3
of the frequencies, 1
When the cumulative frequency is increasing then the first quartile is located at the
position of 1
th of the total frequency. Hence,
the position of Q1 =
× 52 th position = 13th position
the position of Q2 =
the position of Q3 =
× 52th position = 26th position
× 52th position = 39th position
Now it is needed to find the data corresponding to the points 13, 26 and 39
(frequencies)
of the vertical axis. The necessary lines are illustrated in the figure. As an example
the first quartile can be found as follows.
Since the first quartile is located at the 13th position, a horizontal line is drawn from
the point 13 on the vertical axis until it meets the curve. From the point that line
meets the curve, a vertical line is drawn until it meets the horizontal axis. The value
of that point on the horizontal axis is the first quartile.
If we find the quartiles for the given example, then we get Q1 = 26, Q2 = 42 and
Q3 = 55'
Hence, the interquartile range = Q3 – Q1 = 55 – 26 = 29.
As an example, if the total frequency of a frequency distribution is 51 then the first,
the second and the third quartiles are in the
× 51 = 12.75th position
× 51 = 25.5th position
× 51 = 38.25th position respectively.
Hence the quartiles can be found by considering the values on the x-axis
corresponding to the values 12.75, 25.5 and 38.25 (or the appropriate values
rounded to the scale of the graph) on the vertical axis.

Geometric progressions
By studying this lesson you will be able to,
² identify whether a given number sequence is a geometric progression,
² use the formula for the nth term of a geometric progression,
² use the formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric progression
² solve problems related to geometric progressions.
16.1 Geometric Progressions
Let us first recall what we learnt in grade 10 about arithmetic progressions. Given
below is an arithmetic progression.
5, 7, 9, 11, ...
In this sequence, by adding the constant value 2 to any term, the term next to it is
obtained. We called this constant value the common difference of the arithmetic
progression.
Now, careful observe the sequence given below.
3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, ...
In this sequence, the first term is 3. The second term is obtained by multiplying
the first term by 2, third term is obtained by multiplying the second term by 2. The
sequence continues in this manner, where, each term multiplied by 2 is the next
term. In other words, if we divide any term other than the first term, by the previous
term we get the constant value 2.
A sequence that yields a fixed value when any term, other than the first term, is
divided by the previous term is called a geometric progression. The fixed value, by
which each term is multiplied to obtain the next term, is called the common ratio of
the geometric progression. The common ratio of the above geometric progression
is 2.
Given a number sequence, one can check whether it is a geometric progression by
doing the following test. Note down the value obtained by dividing the second term
by the first term. Similarly, note down the values obtained by dividing the third
term by the second term, fourth term by the third term and so forth. If the values
noted down are all equal, then it is a geometric progression. When the noted values
are all equal, this common value is the common ratio.
Example 1
Check whether the number sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, ... is a geometric progression.
... The given sequence is a geometric progression. Moreover, the common
ratio is 3.
Example 2
Check whether the number sequence 200, 100, 50, 20, ... is a geometric progression.
Because the ratios are not equal, this sequence is not a geometric progression.
Example 3
Check whether the number sequence 5, – 10, 20, – 40, 80, ... is a geometric
progression.
... –10
= – 2,
= – 40
= – 2,
= – 2,
= – 2
– 40 = – 2
... This is a geometric progression with common ratio – 2.
Example 4
The terms 4, x, 16 are consecutive terms of a geometric progression. What is the
value of x?
x by solving this equation.
because the terms are in a geometric progression. We can find the value of
, then x2 = 64.
... (x – 8) (x + 8) = 0
... x = 8 or x = – 8
x2 – 82 = 0
Let us check for each of the values we have obtained, whether the three terms 4, x,
16 are in a geometric progression.
When x = 8" the sequence 4, 8, 16 is a geometric progression with common ratio 2.
When x = – 8" the sequence 4, – 8, 16 is a geometric progression with a common
ratio – 2.

given below.

(g) 0.0002, 0.002, 0.02, 0.2, ... (h)
(f) 81, 27, 3,

16.2 n th term of a Geometric Progression
Recall that you learnt, in Grade 10, that the nth term of an arithmetic progression
with first term a and common difference d is Tn = a + (n – 1) d.
Let us now consider how we can obtain an expression for the nth term of a geometric
progression. We will write —a˜ for the first term of the geometric progression and
—r˜ for the common ratio. Moreover, we will denote the nth term of the sequence
by Tn .
Consider the geometric progression 2, 6, 18, 54, ... . Here, the first term (a) is 2
and the common ratio (r) is 3'
Carefully observe that;
T1 = 2 = 2 1 = 2 31 – 1
T2 = 6 = 2 3 = 2 32 – 1
T3 = 18 = 2 3 3 = 2 33 – 1
T4 = 54 = 2 3 3 3 = 2 34 – 1
The above expressions can be written in terms of the first term (a) and the common
ratio (r), as
T1 = 2 30 = a r1 – 1
T2 = 2 31 = a r2 – 1
T3 = 2 32 = a r3 – 1
T4 = 2 33 = a r4 – 1
According to the observable pattern, the nth term Tn can be written as Tn = ar n – 1'
The nth term of the geometric progression with first term a and common
ratio r is given by
Tn = ar n – 1 '
Example 1
Find the 5th term of the geometric progression with first term 3 and common ratio 2.
a = 3, r = 2, n = 5
Tn = ar n – 1
T5 = 3 25 – 1
= 3 24
= 3 16
Therefore, the 5th term is 48'
Example 2
Find the fifth and the seventh terms of the geometric progression 81, 27, 9,...
7 – 1
T7 = 81 1
a = 81
= 81 1
Tn = ar n – 1
= 81 1
... T5 = 81 1
= 81 1
Thus, the fifth term is 1 and the seventh term is 1
5 – 1

9. Find the 9th term of the geometric progression 0.6, 0.3, 0.15,...
10. Find the 10th term of the geometric progression 8, 12, 18,...
16.3 Using the formula Tn = ar n – 1
When all but one from the first term (a)" common ratio (r), nth term Tn and n, of a
geometric progression are given, the unknown value can be found by substituting
the given values into Tn = ar n – 1'
consider at the following examples'
Example 1
Find the first term of the geometric progression with common ratio 3 and 4th term
r = 3, n = 4, Tn = 54
Tn = ar n – 1
... T4 = a (3)4 – 1
... 54
= a (3)3
... 54 = a 27
... a =
The first term of the sequence is 2'
Example 2
Find the common ratio of the geometric progression with first term 5 and 7th term
320, and list the first five terms.
a = 5, n = 7, T7 = 320
... 320
... r 6
Tn = ar (n – 1)
T7 = 5 (r)7 – 1
= 5 (r)6
= (+2)6 or (–2)6
= 2 or – 2
... r
There are two values for the common ratio. Hence, there are two geometric
progressions satisfying the given conditions.
First five terms of the progression with r
First five terms of the progression with r
= 2 are 5, 10, 20, 40, 80'
= – 2 are 5, – 10, 20, – 40, 80'
Example 3
Which term is
ratio 1
64, of the geometric progression with first term 64 and common
a = 64, r =
, Tn =
Tn = ar n – 1
64 = 64 1
(n – 1)
64 64
(n – 1)
(n – 1)
(n – 1) = 6
n = 6 + 1
= 7 ... it is the 7th term that is equal to
(n – 1)
Example 4
The first term of a geometric progression, is 160 and the 6th term is 1215. Find the
common ratio of the progression.
a = 160, T6 = 1215, n = 6
Tn = ar (n – 1)
160r 5
... r 5
1215 = 160 (r)6 – 1
= 1215
... r =
... The common ratio is 1
Similarly, when any two terms of a geometric progression are given, Tn = ar n – 1
can be used to find the first term and the common ratio. Consider the following
example.
Example 5
Find the common ratio and the first term of the geometric progression with 3rd term
48 and 6th term 3072.
Let us first construct two equations from the given information.
Tn = ar n – 1
T3 = ar (3 – 1)
T6 = ar (6 – 1)
= 3072
Both unknowns, a and r, appear in both equations 1 and 2. We can easily remove a
from these two by dividing the equations.
ar 2 =
r = 4
Substitute r = 4 to 1
a (4)2 = 48
16 a = 48
a = 3
First term of the progression = 3
Common ratio = 4
Example 6
The 6th term of a geometric progression is – 8 and the 10th term of the same
progression is – 128.
(i) Show that there are two such geometric progressions.
(ii) Write down the first five term of each progression.
(i) Tn = ar (n – 1)
T6 = ar (6 – 1)
= – 8
T10 = ar (10 – 1)
= – 128
– 128
ar 5 =
= 24 or (– 2)4
r = 2 or – 2
Because there are two values for the common ratio, there are two such progressions.
(ii) Substituting r = 2, to 1
= – 8
a (2)5 = – 8
a 32 = – 8
a = –
First five terms of the geometric progression with r = 2 and a = –
, – 1, – 2, – 4.
Substituting r = – 2, to 1
= – 8
a (–2)5 = – 8
a (– 32) = – 8
First five terms of the geometric progression with r = – 2 and a =

16.4 The sum of the first n terms of a geometric progression
The sum of the first n terms of a geometric progression with first term a and common
ratio r is denoted by Sn' Let us now consider finding a formula for Sn '
We can write the first n terms of the geometric progression as,
T1 = a, T2 = ar, T3 = ar2, T4 = ar3, ...., Tn = ar (n – 1).
Sn = T1 + T2 + T3 + T4 + ...... + Tn
... Sn = a + ar + ar2 +ar3 + ............ + ar (n – 1)
We use the following technique to find a formula for Sn. First we will multiply both
sides of equation 1 by r. Then we get,
r Sn = ar + ar2 + ar3 + ar4 + ............ + ar n
Now, when we subtract 1 from 2 , we get"
r Sn – Sn = arn – a ^observe that many terms on the right hand side cancel&
... Sn (r –1) = a (rn –1)
a (rn –1)
... Sn =
(r –1)
(r ≠ 1)
This is an expression for Sn in terms of a, r, n. By multiplying both the numerator
and the denominator of the right hand side by – 1, we can also express it as
a (1– rn)
(1– r)
To find Sn , one can use either Sn =
a (r n –1)
(r –1)
or Sn =
a (1– r n )
(1– r)
appropriately.
Example 1
Find the sum of the first five terms of the geometric progression 2, 6, 18, ..., both
by finding the first five terms and adding them up, and by using the formula for Sn .
Let us first find the sum by adding all five terms. We are given that
T1 = 2, T2 = 6 and T3 = 18
Moreover,
T4 = 18 3 = 54 and
T5 = 54 3 = 162 .
Therefore" S5 = T1 + T2 + T3 + T4 + T5
= 2 + 6 + 18 + 54 + 162
= 242
to find the sum.
a (rn –1)
(r –1)
= 3, n = 5.
Now let us use Sn =
Because a = 2, r = 6
a (rn – 1)
r – 1
and Sn =
2 (35 – 1)
3 – 1
2 (243 – 1)
2 242
= 242
Sum of the first five terms is 242'
When the values of the terms are large or when there are many terms to add, it is
easier to to use the formula for Sn.
Example 2
Find the sum of the first 6 terms of the geometric progression 120, – 60, 30, ....
using the formula.
a = 120, r = – 60
= – 1
, n = 6
Substituting into Sn =
a (1 – rn)
1 – r
gives us
120 1 – 1
1 – 1
120 1 – 1
= 120 63
= 120 63
= 315
= 78 3
Therefore, the sum of the first six terms is 78 3
. These are a, r, n and Sn'
There are four unknowns in the formula Sn =
When any three of these are given, we can find the value of the remaining unknown
a (1 – rn)
1 – r
by using this formula. Let us consider some examples of this type.
Example 3
Find how many terms of the initial terms need to be added from the geometric
progression 5, 15, 45, ... in order for the sum to be equal to 1820.
5 = 3, Sn = 1820
a = 5, r = 15
a (rn –1)
1820 =
5 (3n – 1)
3 – 1
5 (3n – 1)
1820 =
2 1820 = 5 (3n – 1)
2 1820
= 3n – 1
728 = 3n – 1
1 + 728 = 3n
729 = 3n
36 = 3n
n = 6
First six terms need to be added.

16.5 Problem solving related to geometric progressions
In this section we will discuss various types of problems related to geometric
progressions, that we have not discussed above.
Example 1
Of a geometric progression, the sum of the first and second terms is equal to 9
and the sum of the 4th and 5th terms is equal to – 72. Find the first 5 terms of the
progression.
T1 = a, T2 = ar
a + ar = 9
a (1 + r) = 9
T4 = ar3, T5 = ar4
ar3 + ar4 = – 72
ar3 (1 + r) = – 72
ar 3(1 + r)
a (1 + r)
= – 8
= (– 2)3
r = – 2
Substituting r = – 2, to 1
a [1 + (– 2)] = 9
a (– 1) = 9
a = – 9
First five terms of the progression are
– 9, 18, – 36, 72, – 144'
