Let us learn about sports and
outdoor activities
Engaging in sports and outdoor activities create the opportunity for us to spend our
leisure time effectively. Sports contribute towards reducing stress, gaining pleasure
and developing personal values. Sports also help us develop the ability to obey
rules and regulations and the spirit of working as a team.
In previous grades you have gained knowledge about minor games, leadup games,
folk games and organized sporting events.
In this chapter you will gain knowledge about the skills of spiking and blocking
in volleyball; attacking, defending and shooting in netball and kicking, stopping
and heading the ball in football. You will also learn exercises that are useful in
developing these skills and rules and regulations related to these games while
gaining some knowledge about the judging criteria as well. In addition, you will
also learn about outdoor activities like hiking and expeditions to forests which are
related to outdoor education.
4.1 Volleyball
Volleyball is a team event played between two teams of six players. In volleyball
each team has to pass the ball over the net by hitting the ball using any part of the
body and ground it in the opposite court. After the player on the right hand side of
the back row of a team has served the ball to the opposite side, the ball is played
until it goes out of court or until a team fails to return the ball properly to the
opposite side.
Volleyball is very important for us because it is the national game of our country.
Volleyball has become popular because of following reasons:
1. Does not incur a high cost
2. Minimum equipment is required
3. Limited space is required
4. Does not take much time to complete a game
5. Rules are simple and clear
6. Easy to follow and a rich source of entertainment

Out of these skills you will learn spiking and blocking in this chapter.
Spiking
Figure 4.1 - spiking
In volleyball, slamming the ball that is over the net into the opposing team’s court
is called spiking.
 Except for serving and blocking, all the other acts of passing the ball into the
opposing team’s court can be considered as spiking.
 When executing a spike, releasing the ball clearly off the five fingers is accepted
mostly while touching and throwing the ball are not allowed.
 Spiking is considered to be complete when the ball has completely passed the
vertical plane of the net or when the ball makes contact with a defender of the
opposing team.
Spiking is very important in ensuring the victory of a team and maintaining the
spirit of the game. Therefore it is vital that the correct technique of executing a
spike is learnt. For easy understanding, let us study this under four stages.
1. Hitting approach
2. Take-off
3. Hit the ball
4. Landing
1. Hitting approach
Steps a player takes from the moment he starts getting ready for the spike until the
take off is called the hitting approach. This is determined on the requirement of the
individual player who executes the spike. The hitting approach could occur in two,
three or four steps.
The following figure shows the three-step hitting approach for a right handed spiker.
Figure 4. 2 - Hitting approach
To have a better understanding of this, study figure 4.2 b and observe carefully the
movement of the hands, legs and the body.
² The way arms are swung is very important in the hitting approach; the two arms
which are swung forward with the first step should be swung backwards with the
second step. The second step should be longer than the first. The last step,
i.e., the left foot , should be placed a little ahead of the right foot. A right-hander
should take steps beginning with the left foot, then the right and the left again.
² A very good take-off can be made by generating more speed during the approach.
2. Take-off
• A good take-off is essential for a successful hit. In a good take-off greater part of
the attacker’s body is raised above the net. Therefore the intended hit can be made
very successfully.
• During take-off, the player has to bend the knees and straighten them like a
spring.
• When in the air, the body of the spiker should be bent backwards like a bow.
• When spiking, the palm of the hitting hand should be raised to a position that is
above and behind the head so that the elbow moves slightly behind the shoulder.
• The free arm should lie upright before the body and be aligned with the position
of the head and the eyes should be focused on the ball.
3. Hit the ball
Figure 4. 3 - Take-off
• When hitting the ball the fingers should be brought together, curved and made
rigid.
• When hitting the ball, the shoulder that moved backwards should move forward
very fast with stretching of the hitting arm as far as possible and hitting the ball
at the maximum height.
• The balance of the body should be maintained and the free arm should move
downwards at the time of hitting the ball.
4. Landing
Figure 4. 4 - Hit the ball
Landing means returning to the ground by lowering the body by way of bending the
knees and controlling the body weight.
Figure 4.5 - Landing
Skills related to spiking can be developed through the
following activities
1. Hold the ball with one hand, raise it above the shoulder and fling it onto the
ground with great force.
Figure 4.6
2. Hold the ball with both hands and fling the ball on to the ground with great force
dashing forwards with the body bent backwards like a bow.
Figure 4.7
3. Drop the ball that is held in the non dominant hand and hit it with the dominant
hand.
Figure 4.8
4. Throw the ball upwards with both hands and hit it standing in the same spot.
Figure 4.9
5. Keep the ball hanging above the head and hit it hard taking off with the correct
spiking approach.
Figure 4.10
Spiking according to the rules-things to be borne in mind
Spiking
³ The front-row players can hit the ball that is at any height within their own court.
³ The back-row players can hit the ball that is at any height taking off from the back
court only. It is illegal to touch the spiking line with feet when taking off to hit or
hit the ball keeping the feet in front of the spiking line. It is not illegal to land on
the front half of the court after hitting the ball having taken off from the rear half
of the court.
³ A back-row player can hit the ball while in the front part of the court, but at least
a part of the ball should be below the top level of the net at the point of hitting.
³ A team cannot complete a spike when the service ball, which is coming to the
court is completely above the top level of the net.
Some fouls committed during spiking
1. Hitting the opposing team’s ball.
2. Hitting the ball so that it goes off the court.
3. A back-court player coming to the front court and hitting the ball that is completely
above the net.
4. Spiking and sending the ball to the opponents court, which was lifted by the
libero player with finger tips in the front part of the court while it is completely
above the level of the net.
Activity
Develop activities that can be used to develop skills related to spiking.
Blocking
Blocking is obstructing the ball, above the level of the net by front row players,
which was hit by the opposing team and has cleared the net.
 This can be called a defensive as well as an attacking strategy.
The blocking technique can be studied under four stages.
1. Ready Position
2. Appoaching the ball
3. Take-off and touching the ball
4. Landing
1. Ready Position
² At the ready position, the player has to position himself facing the net about 50cm
behind the net and should keep the body balanced (See the figure 4.11).
2. Approaching the ball
Figure 4.11 - Ready position
² When the setter sets the ball to some place the blocker has to move to that place.
There are three ways of approaching the ball. They are side steps, cross steps and
the dash.
Figure 4.12
a - Side Steps
b - Cross Steps
c - Dash
3. Take-off and touching the ball
² As the knees are bent and the body is lowered, spring up and bring the feet
together stretching the arms upwards.
² Stretch the fingers and slightly curve and stiffen the palm of the hands and pass
the ball over the net to the opposing team using the fingers. When doing this the
arms should be positioned beside the ears in front.
² Bend the body forward and as the ball comes into contact with the hands, move
the hands downwards by bending the wrists.
Figure 4.13 - Taking off
4. Landing
² Plan your landing by landing on the balls of your feet with your knees and ankles
bent.
² Arms are swung downwards as landing takes place.
² The weight of the body should be balanced by bending the knees and the player
should get ready for the next move.
The following activities can be done to practise blocking
1. Take-off properly at the net that has been tied at a lower level to suit the height
of the players and practise blocking without using the ball.
Figure 4.14
2. Two players take off from opposite sides of the net and touch each other’s hands
pretending to block the ball.
Figure 4.15
3. Stand at the net and move sideways performing the action of blocking.
4. Two players stand on opposite sides of the net, leap up and pass the ball over the
net to each other.
Figure 4.16
5. The ball is held above and close to the net and the players practise blocking by
touching the ball.
Figure 4.17
Figure 4.18
6. Block the ball that is being hit close to the net.
Blocking can be classified according to the number of players involved in the
blocking. It can be named as single, double or triple blocking.
Figure 4.19
Blocking according to the rules-thing to be borne in mind
³ Only the front-court players can complete the coverage. At the time a blocking
takes place, some part of the player’s body should lie above the top level of
the net. The blocking action without touching the ball is called an ‘attempt to
block’. A blocking becomes complete only after the blocker has touched the
ball.
³ Joint block
When two or three players join together and perform blocking, it is called a
joint block. The blocking becomes complete when any one of them touches the
ball.
³ Repeated touch of the ball by one or more of the blockers is considered a single
touch that happens during the same posture. Touching the ball while blocking is
not considered a hit and therefore a team gets three hits when they receive the
ball to their court after blocking.
³ After blocking any player of the team can make the first hit. Even the player
who did the blocking can make the first hit.
³ While blocking, a player may attempt to block by extending the hands and arms
over the net to the opponents’ court so that it does not obstruct the opponents.
However, blocking can be done only after an opponent has hit the ball.
Officiating Volleyball Games
The following officials are required to officiate a volleyball match:
² First referee
² Second referee
² Scorer
² Assistant scorer
² Two or four line judges
The first referee
The first referee should carry out his/her duties seated or standing on the referee’s
stand located at one end of the net. His/her view should be approximately 50 cm
above the upper level of the net.
The second referee
The second referee should stand on the ground outside the court close to the pole
on the opposite side of the first referee.
The scorer/ Assistant Scorer
The scorer should sit facing the first referee at the scorer’s table that is placed on the
side opposite of the first referee’s position.

4.2 Netball
Netball is a sport that is very popular among females. Twelve players can be
registered for a game of netball. A netball team should consist of seven players to
play the game but a game of netball can also be played with five players.
Figure 4.20 below shows how players should be placed in the court at the start
of a game. The symbols (letters) relevant to each player of one team is shown in
the boxes. According to the rules that are applied at the start of the game, all the
players, except for the centre player (C), should be within their goal areas. They
can come to the centre area of the court when the referee has blown the whistle.
The centre player (C) of the team which gained the centre pass after the referee has
blown the whistle passes the ball from the centre circle following the rule related
to footwork to another player of the own team within three seconds so that the ball
can be caught by that player from within the centre area. After winning a point by
shooting the ball, the two teams take alternate turns of centre pass.

Shooting
In netball when a team has received the ball, taking it to their shooting post by way
of passing it among the members of the own team while avoiding the opposing
players is called attacking. During attack, the players of the opposing team may
obstruct in the following ways:
• prevent a player from catching the ball thrown to her by her team mate.
• prevent a player from moving to a vacant place in order to get the ball.
• prevent a player from passing the ball to her team mate.
Therefore, it is the tactical skill of the attacking player to catch the ball and pass it to
a team member, avoiding the obstructing player cdefender. Given below are a few
of the activities that are useful in developing this skill:
Figure 4.22
Running around obstacles in a zigzag

Figure 4.27
Running changing both pace and direction
Activity
Design activities in which some of the members of your group act as defenders and
the others as attackers who try to pass the ball avoiding the defenders.
Defending
The aim of the defender is to limit the number of goals the opponents would score
or to delay them from scoring goals. The skill of the defender is to prevent the
opponents passing the ball among one another and to get possession of the ball
to their team. In order to continue doing so, the defender should do the following:
² Defend the opponent very efficiently.
² Obstruct the opponent from throwing or shooting the ball that she has
caught.
² Start defending the opponent soon after passing the ball.
² Quickly understand the tactics and the playing style of the opposing
team.
Shooting
Putting the ball through the ring on the goal post from within the goal circle is
called shooting. Shooting can be done with a single hand or with both hands. When
shooting the ball, it is important to control the arms and legs correctly.
² Keep the body erect, raise the dominant hand and hold the ball with the fingers.
The ball should be above the head and in front of the forehead. The free hand is
kept on the ball as a support.
² Start shooting by bending the knees slightly
Figure 4.28
Figure 4.29
² Stretch the arms as the body straightens from the knees. Then release the ball
from the hand so that the ball is pushed upwards with the wrist whilst aiming at
the ring on the goalpost.
The following activities can be performed in order to make shooting successful
Figure 4.30
Practise shooting at different places within the goal circle.

places and shoot.
Rules and regulations
Netball rules and regulations are introduced by the International Federation of
Netball Associations (IFNA). Netball games are governed by 21 key rules. You
gained knowledge about some of those rules in the previous grades and this year,
you will learn some rules related to attacking, defending and shooting.
³ While defending or attacking, a player should neither knock against, push, strike
the opponent nor grab the ball from the opponent.
³ Players cannot stretch their hands sideways and defend.
³ A player possessing the ball should not be obstructed within a distance of
less than 0.9m (3 ft.).
³ When shooting, the shooter should not be obstructed by the opponent stretching
the arms, standing within a distance of less than 0.9 m (3 ft.).
When above rules are violated, a penalty pass or a chance to shoot a goal is given
on the spot. The player who committed the offence should stand by the side of the
player who did not commit the offence so that she does not get obstructed. The
player who committed the offence cannot join the play until the ball is released
from the hands of the player who did not commit the offence.
On occasions where an attacker and a defender of the opposing teams;
1. get hold of the ball at the same time
2. commit an offence at the same time so that play is obstructed
3. move to an offside area at the same time and either one or both of them get hold
of the ball,
the ball is tossed up between the two within the play area and the game is restarted.
Activity
Engage in a game of netball applying the attacking, defending and shooting skills

Judging netball games
The panel of judges at a netball game consists of the following officials:
Two umpires to control the game and to make decisions
• Two timekeepers
• Two scorekeepers
The two umpires should select their sides by tossing a coin. When the umpires
stand facing the court, they judge the half of the court that lies on their right. Figure

4.3 Football
Football is a game played between two teams with eleven players each. Each team
tries to score goals by kicking the ball into the opposing team’s goal. It has won
recognition as the most popular sport in the world as it has become the game that is
watched by the most number of people. In football, the players, except for the goal
keeper, cannot touch the ball with their hands during play. Hence they engage in
play employing a variety of skills.

The techniques we will be learning in this section are kicking, stopping
and heading the ball.
Kicking the ball
The ball can be kicked using different parts of the foot. Let us study the following
types of kicks:
1. Kicking with the toe
2. Kicking with the inside of the foot
3. Kicking with the outside of the instep
4. Kicking with the heel
1. Kicking with the toe
Toe kick is used to make the ball move fast along a straight path. In toe kick, the
ball is kicked with the tips of the toes.
Figure 4.32 - Kicking with the toe
2. Kicking using the inside of the foot
The inside of the foot kick is used for long-distance passes and short-distance
passes. In this kick, the curved inner part of the foot is used to kick the ball.
Figure 4.33 - Kicking with the inside of the foot
3. Kicking with the outside of the instep
The outside of the instep kick is used to make the ball move along a curved path.
The outside of the instep is used for this kick.
Figure 4.34 - Kicking with the out side of the instep
4. Kicking with the heel
The back heel kick is used to flick the ball backwards deceiving the opponent. The
heel is used for this kick.
Figure 4.35 - Kicking with the heel
Stopping the ball
The ball coming towards a player can be stopped using different parts of his body.
In this lesson let us study the ways of stopping the ball:
1. By keeping the foot on the ball
2. Using the innerside of the foot
3. Using the chest
4. Using the abdomen
1. Stopping the ball by keeping the foot on the ball
The ball is stopped by keeping the sole of the foot on the ball as it comes rolling
along the ground or, if the ball is moving through the air, just as it touches the
ground.
Figure 4.36 - Stopping the ball by keeping the foot on the ball
2. Stopping the ball using the inner side of the foot
A slow moving ball or a fast moving ball is stopped using the innerside of the foot.
When stopping the ball in this manner, the foot is drawn a bit backwards just as the
ball touches the foot.
Figure 4.37 - Stopping the ball using the inner side of
the foot
3. Stopping the ball using the chest
A ball that is moving in the air can be stopped using the chest. When stopping the
ball using the chest, the chest should be drawn a little backwards just as the ball
hits the chest.
Figure 4.38 - Stopping the ball using the chest
4. Stopping the ball using the abdomen
A ball that bounces on the ground can be stopped using the abdomen. When stopping
the ball using the abdomen, the abdomen is drawn a little backwards just as the ball
hits the abdomen.
Figure 4.39 - Stopping the ball using the abdomen
Heading the ball
Heading the ball can be done adopting various body postures. In this lesson, let us
study the following methods of heading the ball.
1. Heading the ball without a jump
2. Heading the ball with a jump
3. Heading the ball, that is coming from a side with a jump
1. Heading the ball without a jump
As the ball is moving in the air, heading is done using the forehead while keeping
an eye on the ball. When the ball is headed in this manner, the feet are in contact
with the ground and the ball moves forward.
Figure 4.40 - Heading the ball without a jump
2. Heading the ball with a jump
The eye is kept on the ball that is moving in the air and heading is done with a jump
using the forehead. When heading is done in this manner, the feet lie above the
ground and the ball moves forward.
Figure 4.41 - Heading the ball with a jump
3. Heading the ball, that is coming from a side with a jump
In this method, the ball that is moving in the air is headed using the sides of the head
in order to send the ball in different directions. Most often, the ball is headed with
a jump in this method.
Figure 4.42 - Heading the ball, that is coming from a side with a jump.
It is now clear to you that hitting and stopping the ball can be done using different
parts of the body.
Following activities will help you to develop these skills
1. Two pupils stand apart and practise passing and stopping the ball kicked by
each other alternatively.
Figure 4.43
2. The ball is passed in different ways to stop using different methods (using the
inner-side of the foot, instep of the foot, abdomen).
3. When the ball is passed by one student, another heads the ball with or without a
jump.
Figure 4.44
4. Three students stand apart and head the ball.

4.4 Outdoor educational activities
Engaging in outdoor educational activities provide an important opportunity for us
to communicate with the natural environment, foster love for plants and trees, enjoy
the pleasures it offers and cultivate attitudes towards protecting the environment.
We have seen many outdoor educational activities carried out at school in order to
create opportunities for us to commune with nature. We engage in such activities
mostly to relieve our monotony and to get pleasure and enjoyment. These activities
are very effective means of spending leisure, promoting collective action and
developing personality.

Summary
Volleyball is the national game of Sri Lanka. It is a popular game because of its
distinctive features. Players can engage in different activities to develop spiking
and blocking skills in volleyball. Each of these two skills can be studied under four
stages. There are rules and regulations related to spiking and blocking. The official
hand signals used by referees are important in communicating their judgements.
There are six basic skills in netball. Of these skills, attacking, defending and
shooting were discussed in this chapter. Attacking is passing the ball among team
members while avoiding the opponents and taking it to the relevant post. The aim
of defending is to limit the number of goals the opponents would score or to delay
them from scoring goals. Putting the ball through the ring of the goal post is called
shooting. Netball is governed by 21 key rules.
Football is a game preferred by most countries in the world. It has become so
popular due to its highly competitive and exciting nature. Players adopt various
skills by kicking, stopping and heading the ball. Number of rules are applied and
the decisions are conveyed using a number of different signals.
We enjoy engaging in outdoor activities. Gaining new experiences, new knowledge,
personality development, development of organizing skills and gaining knowledge
on the use of equipment are some of the benefits that we gain by engaging in
outdoor activities which are in turn important life skills. Outdoor activities include
hikes which are organized for various purposes. It is important to have a basic
knowledge about preparing plans for jungel exploration and gaining skills in using
a compass, preparing and reading maps and using the position of constellations to
find the directions.
