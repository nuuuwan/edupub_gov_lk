- Good morning! Actually I am. I had a nice experience yesterday. I
went to a job interview for the first time.

about the particular vacancy by his uncle. Tell me how it was.
-My father had seen this advertisement in the last week's paper
calling for trainee computer operators. After he had discussed it
with my mother he asked me to apply.
- Had they asked for any particular qualifications?
- Of course. They had invited hardworking and talented young
people with basic computer skills to apply. They had not asked for
any experience but they had specified a B pass for English at the
O/Ls.
- So, what happened at the interview? Were you selected?
- I don’t know yet. When I went there, the interview had already
started. I was the last to go in. Well, I think I answered all the
questions well. I’m hopeful that they will take me best.
- Wish you all the luck, Radha. I hope you’ll get the job.
- Thanks, Saroj.
