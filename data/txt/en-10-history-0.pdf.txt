1 Sources of Studying History
Introduction
Sources are needed to study history. The
sources that help us to study history are diverse.
In this unit you will learn the areas such as,
introduction to sources, the way how history
is built on the information provided by the
sources and the benefits of studying history.
1.1 Classification of Sources
History is a subject which studies the past
human activities. When we study the history of
hundreds and thousands of years back, we find
writings and various creations made by people
who lived in those ages. They are called ‘sources’
because information about past human activities
can be extracted from them. The sources, which
belonged to each different age, provide us a
good understanding about those eras and their
social backgrounds. Thus, when the information
taken from those sources are studied logically,
the history about people’s lives in each period is
formed.
As there are a number of sources which are
available to study history, they are mainly divided
into two;
1. Literary sources
2. Archaeological sources
Books and documents written at different
time periods by the people who lived in the
past are considered ‘literary sources’. Relics,
monuments, coins, inscriptions and various
ruins which are unearthed from archaeological
excavations
called
‘archaeological sources’. Next, let’s discuss the
above mentioned two types further using the
sources which are helpful to study the history of
Sri Lanka.
experiments
1. Literary Sources
literary sources, which can be
used to study the history of Sri Lanka, can be
categorized into two, as, ‘local literary sources’
and ‘foreign literary sources’. The texts, written
by Sri Lankans in the form of prose and poetry
from time to time about two thousand years ago
are considered ‘local literary sources’. Apart from
the texts written by Sri Lankans, some books
were written by foreigners who were interested
in Sri Lanka. Or else, some foreign writers have
included information about Sri Lanka in the
books they wrote. Thus, the books written by
foreign writers mentioning information about
Sri Lanka are called ‘foreign literary sources’.
■ Local Literary Sources
Among the local literary sources in Sri Lanka
‘Deepawamsa’ is considered the oldest text.
Deepawamsa was written in about 4th century
A.D. Deepawamsa
consists of historical
information of this country up to the end of
King Mahasen’s ruling period and descriptions
of the history of the Buddhist order (Sasana)
in this country.
the history has been written in one continuous
text, Sri Lankans can be proud because the
history of this country has been written in one
text. Mahawamsa is considered a more credible
historical source because some historical events
recorded in it have been substantiated by the
inscriptions and some other sources.
About four centuries after the writing of
Mahawamsa, in Pali, an annotation was compiled
in order to interpret it by explaining some areas.
That text, which is called the ‘Mahawamsa
Teekawa’(annotation of the Mahawamsa), is
named as Wansattappakasini. It consists of a lot
of information which are not available in some
other sources.
Type of Source
Examples
Sandesha Kawya Mayura, Thisara,
Selalihini Sandesha
Prashasthi Kawya Perakumba Siritha
Hatan Kawya
Seethawaka Hatana,
Constantinu Hatana,
Ingirisi Hatana
Table No:1.1 A few ancient literary sources consisting
different content from each other
A number of books, which can be considered
to be local literary works, had been written
from Anuradhapura era to Kandyan era of the
history of this country. The books, considered as
Buddhist religious texts such as Bodhiwamasa,
Thupawamsa,
Poojawaliya
Dhatuwamsa,
and Saddharmalankaraya, are important to
study the history of Rajarata civilization. The
Nikaya Sangraha which has been written on
the history of the Buddhist order(Sasana) and
Rajawaliya which includes political information
of the country are important sources of studying
history from Gampola to Kotte period. Sandesha
Kawya, Prashasthi Kawya and Hatan Kawya
are important to study the history between the
periods of Kotte and Kandy. Some examples are
given in the table No 1.1.
The local books were written during different
periods and the reasons which influenced to write
Fig 1.1. Ancient literary and religious information as well
as the Wamsakatha have been written on ola leaves. Sri
Lanka inherits a tradition of talipots, which belonged to a
long period of time.
But, some historical events have been recorded
briefly in Deepawamsa. Repetitions too can be
seen in this source. Therefore, Mahawamsa was
composed as a historical chronicle with lesser
mistakes than Deepawamsa.
Mahawamsa is a text with several parts. The
first part of it was written by a Bhikku named
‘Mahanama’ who lived in the ‘Diksanda Seneviya’
Piriwena (monastery). As in Deepawamsa, the
first part of Mahawamsa consists of the historical
information of this country from the arrival of
the Lord Buddha to Sri Lanka up to the end of
the ruling time of king Mahasen. This part had
been written in about 5th or 6th century A.D.
One can see a certain similarity between the
information of Deepawamsa and the first part of
Mahawamsa. The reason for this may have been
the influence of the early texts such as, Seehala
Attakatha Mahawamsa, Uttara Vihara Attakatha
and Vinaya Attakatha which were written before
these two sources.
After the first part of Mahawamsa was written by
Mahanama Thero, some other writers extended
Mahawamsa as a continuous text with several
parts by including some information about
their contemporary time periods from time to
time. Therefore, the history of Sri Lanka has
been written continuously in Mahawamsa. As
there are a limited number of countries of which
them too are different. The books which had been
written from Anuradhapura era to the beginning
of Kotte era have had religious objectives. Some
books were written a few centuries after the
historical incidents, which have been mentioned
in the same books. Therefore, when we form our
history using the literary sources, we have to pay
our attention to the facts given below.
1. The time in which the sources were written
2. The author of the source
3. The author’s objectives
4. The way in which facts were obtained for the
source
Therefore, you may understand that you have to
be clever when you refer to the sources.
■ Foreign Sources
trade relations
As Sri Lanka maintained
with foreign countries from early period of
Anuradhapura era, many foreigners who were
engaged in trade activities in the Indian Ocean
were aware of this country. Therefore, the
foreigners, who had written from the period of
B.C, have included some information about Sri
Lanka in their books. From ancient time there
was a good relation between Sri Lanka and India.
Therefore, some Indian books have mentioned
information about Sri Lanka. Some Tamil
books, such as Seelappadikaram, Manimekalayi
and Padirruppattu written in India too have
information about Sri Lanka. Some foreigners
tended even to write books with separate
information about Sri Lanka after the arrival of
the Portuguese in this country in the 16th century.
When we examine the foreign sources consisting
information about Sri Lanka, we can clearly see
that there had been writers who came to Sri
Lanka and studied and wrote about it as well as
writers who didn't visit Sri Lanka but inquired
information about Sri Lanka from others and
wrote.
Uses of Literary Sources
information about political,
1. To prepare the historical chronology.
2. To obtain
economic, and social affairs in each era.
3. To substantiate the information provided by
one source with another source.
4. To study the international relations of a
country (in this regard foreign sources are very
important).

2. Archaeological Sources
Archaeological sources can be divided into a
few categories such as epigraphy, coins, ruins,
drawings, sculptures and antiquities.
Epigraphy
is a word used commonly
Epigraphy
introduce writings on stones (Shila), clay slabs,
walls, copper plates, golden plates, wood, and on
various urns. Writings on stone slabs or rocks
are called ‘Sellipi / Shilalipi’ inscriptions.
Inscriptions (Sellipi)
According to the shapes of the stones on which
writings have been inscribed, the inscriptions
can be categorized as cave inscriptions, rock
inscriptions
(Giri Lipi), pile
inscriptions
(Tam Lipi), slab inscriptions (Puwaru Lipi)
to write
After the 2nd century A.D. inscriptions were
established
records on various
events such as offering premises to temples,
administrating temples, informing government
laws to people, charge taxes, trading, forgiving
convicts, and appreciating the service of some
people. Therefore, much information, which
is not provided by the literary sources can be
discovered from the inscriptions.
Coins
Coins were used in Sri Lanka from Anuradhapura
era. The oldest coins found in this country are
called ‘ Kahapana’. The names ‘Purana’ and
‘Dharana’ too are used for them. The tusker
and Swastika coins, Lakshmi coins and a type
of golden coins named ‘Aka’ were used in this
country. The copper coins (Thamba Massa) were
used during the Polonnaruwa kingdom. The
coins needed for the country were produced in
the country itself and even the moulds which
were used to produce coins have been discovered
in excavations. Apart from the local coins, Roman
coins, Chinese coins, and Indian coins are found
in Sri Lanka. In studying the economic condition,
trade, and use of metals, coins are an immensely
important source. The study of ancient coins is
called ‘numismatics’.

inscriptions in this country are named ‘Brahmi
inscriptions’ and they were written to record the
events such as offering of caves to Bhikku.

Ancient Ruins
Many ruins such as ancient buildings, stupas,
stone pillars, tanks and ponds can be seen in Sri
Lanka. Since some places, where ancient people
of this country lived are still in wilderness, such
ruins exist even in and close to the forestry areas.
These ruins, which are called archaeological
monuments, are a very good source to study the
history of this country. These ruins help us to
gain a clear knowledge on various aspects such as
creative ability, technology, building designing or
architecture, craftsmanship, ability to conserve
the environment and water management of the
ancient people.

Drawings, Sculpture and Antiquities
Ancient drawings, sculpture and engravings are
live evidence that display our culture. Drawings,
sculpture, and engravings are helpful to gain
information about various aspects of the ancient
people such as their clothes, art skills, use of
jewellery, using colours, and religious beliefs; for
example, the frescos in Sigiriya provide us some
information about clothes, jewellery, hair styles
and beauty culture of women who lived during
ancient times.
The objects which are remaining now, after
being created or used by the ancient people can
be introduced as antiquities. Antiquities are
in the museums, religious places, and various
institutions and in care of some people of this
country. Many antiquities are discovered in
excavations. Antiquities help us to understand
many different aspects of the ancient people,
such as their abilities, skills, ancient culture,
technology, foreign relations and their life style.
You may see that there are diverse sources which
can be used to construct the history of Sri Lanka.
In constructing the history with the help of the
information extracted from a particular source,
one has to be shrewd in using that source.
Historical sources in Sri Lanka are past reports
rather than past events. And also there is a
possibility of including the personal likes and
dislikes of the authors of these books into the
sources. Archaeological sources are mostly
considered as contemporary ones
historical events. Accordingly, if the information
mentioned in the literary sources is substantiated
by the archaeological sources, that information
can be considered credible. In constructing
history regarding a certain historical incident, all
sources relevant to that incident should be used.
Next, after analyzing the various information
received from the sources critically, history
should be constructed by using the most credible
information. Accordingly, archaeological sources
are useful to fill up what lacks in the literary
sources, to obtain new information and to
substantiate the information mentioned in the
literary sources.
Fig. 1.5. This coin ,used in Sri Lanka, has been made of
gold. It is called ‘medieval golden coins (Madyakalina
Ran Kahawanu)’. These coins are a source which helps
to study not only the ancient economy but also the
technology.
1.2 Importance of Learning History
History is a subject which is linked with the study
of sources. It could be studied with curiosity too.
Therefore, one who studies history naturally
tends to read books. Since the reader comes
across with diverse facts, ideas, and opinions
1.3 Protecting
Archaeological Sources
When we consider the
long history of Sri Lanka,
ancient
expansion of
population,
number of people who
had lived in this country,
what remains here for
archaeological
sources today is only the
creations made of long
lasting raw materials such
as stone, metal and clay;
or large scale creations
such as tanks and canals.
There is a possibility of
these valuable sources getting destroyed due to
speedy urbanization, expansion of settlements,
constructing roads, constructing buildings, and
agricultural activities happening in the country.
Today we see historical places, monuments and
antiquities because our ancestors had protected
them. Therefore, it is a responsibility of the
citizens of the country to protect them as the
present generation.
There are different types of ancient marks
inscribed on the rocky surfaces in various areas in
Sri Lanka. Among them various figures such as,
Sun and Moon, Palmyra- fan, bow, arrow, conch,
ox-hoof, tusker- step, figures of various animals
are marks that show the ancient borders of areas;
or they are an ancient form of communication as
the present road signs. Some people dig out and
destroy the places where there are these marks
and moonstones, guard stones, stone pillars and
other antiquities by misunderstanding that the
treasures have been deposited in such places.
These activities and other activities like scribbling
and drawing pictures in historical places and on
the antiquities will pave the way to destroy the
antiquities. It is a punishable offence according
to the law of the country. Therefore, you should
be determined to protect the antiquities as the
students who have understood the value of them.
Fig. 1.6. The sculpture of Man and the Head of Horse in Isurumuni temple in Anuradhapura.
This sculpture is believed to have been created in 7th or 8th century A.D. This sculpture
represents the gods ‘Agni’ (Head of Horse)and ‘Parjanya’. (Image of man)
in reading books, his or her critical sense gets
developed. Therefore, he or she tends to think of
anything with a logical mind and this will help
him or her to understand the problems properly.
When the problems are understood properly,
he or she will tend to find solutions to those
problems creatively. Therefore, when one learns
history, it helps him or her to develop his or her
personality. Apart from these, one will gain the
benefits given below by studying history.
1. Proper understanding of society and the
world in which one lives
2. Constructing future by understanding the
present through the past experiences
3. Recognizing the national identity
4. Building up national reconciliation
by loving humanity
5. Respecting others’ cultures
6. Tolerating different views
Important Facts
 The things that help learn history are called sources.
 Sources are divided into two as literary sources and archaeological sources.
 Books and documents belong to the literary source category and ruins and various
antiques are archaeological sources.
 We can realize how our ancestors faced various experiences by learning history. Through
that one can get the knowledge necessary to face the same problems at present.
 History of a country reflects the identity of the citizens who live in that country.

Diksanda Seneviya Pirivena
(Monastery)–
There were several monasteries affiliated to
Anuradhapura Maha Vihara. Sunhatha Pirivena,
Marugana Pirivena, Phalagga Pirivena were some
of them. Diksanda Seneviya Pirivena was another
one that belonged to them. Mahanama Thero, who
composed Mahawamsa, lived in that temple.
Fa-Hsien Thero – Fa-Hsien Thero was a Chinese
monk. He came to India on foot in search of Buddhist
texts. Fa-HsienThero arrived in Sri Lanka in the 5th
century A.D. and stayed in Anuradhapura Maha
Vihara for two years. He was born at Wuyang
village in Shun- Si province in China. He has
mentioned some things existed in Sri Lanka in his
travelling accounts.
Hsuan Tsang – Hsuan Tsang (602 -664 A.D) was a
Chinese monk. He came to India on a pilgrimage.
He left China in 629 A.D. and was engaged in
his pilgrimage for sixteen years. Meanwhile, he
recorded what he saw in Asia. Though he did not
come to Sri Lanka, he recorded what he learnt
about Sri Lanka when he was in India. Even those
information is important to study the history of this
country in the 7th century A.D.
Joao Ribeiro – He was a Portuguese national. In
the month of March, 1640 he came to Sri Lanka
to serve in the Portuguese army. He reached the
rank of captain in his army by staying 18 years in
Sri Lanka and serving in the army. In his old age
he wrote several books about Sri Lanka by living
in Lisben city in Portugal. Those books are highly
important to study the history of Sri Lanka in the
17th century.
Philippus Baldaeus (1632 – 1672 A.D) – Philippus
Balaedius was a Dutch priest. He came to Sri
Lanka with the Dutch army.
His duty was to serve the East Indian Trade
Company of the Dutch. In addition to his duty,
he made records on the social life, language and
culture in Sri Lanka. Those records have been
published in Dutch and German languages.
Baldaeus' records are important to study the Sri
Lankan history in the 17th century A.D.
Robert Knox – Robert Knox (1641 -1720 A.D) was
an English naval captain. He came to India by ship
with his father when he was 14 years old. In 1658
while he was sailing to Persia, he came adrift to
Sri Lanka on 19th November 1659 as the mast of
their ship was broken due to a tempest. On that
occasion Robert Knox along with another sixteen
people who were in the ship were arrested by King
Rajasinghe II. He spent nineteen years in Sri lanka
as a prisoner and afterwards escaped. He went to
Arippu in Mannar and then escaped to Bathavia.
In 1680 he went back to England. While he was on
his way back, he wrote a book on his experiences
in Sri Lanka. That book was published in 1681 by
the name of An Historical Relations of the Island
of Ceylon. The book consists of descriptions and
drawings which reflect the Sri Lankan society in
the 17th century, the time in which he stayed in this
country.
Fernão de Queiroz – He was a priest of the catholic
Jesuit sect. Queiroz was a Portuguese national.
In 1688 he wrote a book on Sri Lanka. Its name
was Temporal and Spiritual Conquest of Ceylon.
Queiroz did not come to Sri Lanka. He wrote this
book while he was staying in India.
Ancient Settlements
Introduction
Sri Lanka became a human habitation one
hundred and twenty five thousand years
ago. The Homo Sapiens, who are called the
modern man, migrated to this country across
the Indian Ocean. From then on, they spread
themselves in various parts of this country and
adapted themselves to different environmental
conditions in those areas. As they lived a
considerably long time period in this country,
with time their culture too changed. Based on
those changes which occurred in their culture,
the history of human existence in Sri Lanka
has been divided into three stages. The nature
of those stages and how they lived during those
stages will be described to you in this lesson.
2.1 Settlements in the Pre-historic Era
The period which was before the past that is
described by the literary sources is commonly
named as ‘the pre-historic era’. Two cultural
stages belonged to the pre-historic era of Sri
Lanka; the first one was the Stone Age which
existed for a long time; the second was the
period in which there was more tendency of
man towards depending on herbal food, use of
metals and the beginning of living in permanent
settlements. Among these, the word prehistoric
era is used to introduce the Stone Age and the
word proto-historic era is used to introduce the
second period.
Expansion of Settlements
Settlements in Sri Lanka were made by the early
Homo Sapien man. Homo Sapien expanded his
living in a wide geographical area by adapting
himself to different climatic zones in this country.
Their main dependency method was gathering
food by roaming and hunting.
There are many places where evidence, belonging
to the Stone Age in Sri Lanka, is found. The first
one is Rathnapura and the gem mines located
around Rathnapura. The stone tools used by
these people who lived in a distant age and the
bones of some extinct animals are deposited in
the layers of soil mixed with gravel , which is
called lode found in the mines about 90 feet deep
from the ground level. The gravel layers, which
were caused by erosion of mountainous regions
due to extremely heavy rainy periods during the
Pleistocene geographical era, deposited on the
lowlands in this manner.
There is a gravel layer covered with sandy soil
mixed with clay in the ground in the semi-arid
zone in Sri Lanka. The archaeologists have
named it as the Iranamadu formation. The
Iranamadu formation was deposited during the
short warm periods of the Pleistocene era. Some
tools which belonged to the Stone Age are found
in this gravel layer too.
The Expansion of Settlements in Different
Climate Zones
The community which belonged to the Stone
Age had lived in 6 main environmental zones
in Sri Lanka. These environmental zones are
(A) Semi-arid zone (B) Lowland dry zone (C)
Lowland intermediate dry zone (D) Wet Zone
(E) Mountainous dry intermediate zone (F)
Arid zone .

The differences of annual rainfall levels are
considered in deciding these environmental
zones. If there is a difference in the rainfall, it
directly affects the animals and the plants in
that particular area. Therefore, the people in the
Stone Age who adapted themselves to different
environmental zones had differences in their
food consumption and technology. For example
the community of the Stone Age who lived in the
lowland wet zone used mostly oysters living on
the land as their food. Different types of oysters
are abundant in the lowland wet zone. But it is
not so in the lowland dry zone. In those areas
some animals, mostly living in the dry zone like
deer and iguana, were hunted.
Time Periods
Some evidence of the Stone Age has been
discovered from the gravel layer belonging to
the Iranamadu formation located in the depth
of 45 feet from the surface level of the earth in
the area called Pathirajawela in Hambanthota
district belonging to the Southern Province of Sri
Lanka. When the gravel layer was dated using the
scientific analysis, it proved that the gravel layer
was 125000 years old. The gravel layer found in
the depth of 24 feet from the surface of the ground
level in the area of Bundala, Wellegangoda in the
same district belongs to a period of 80000 years
back. Approximately this Stone Age had existed
continuously from before 125000 years up to 1800
B.C. minimum. The dates which substantiate the
longevity of the culture have been confirmed
with the evidence found in several provinces in
Sri Lanka.

Fig 2.1. This cave, located in Pahiyangala, Bulathsinhala in Kaluthara District, was a habitation of the prehistoric men who
lived 38000 years ago. This Pahiyangala cave reveals significant information of the prehistoric people who lived in the
lowland wet zone in Sri Lanka.
Life Style
People of this era lived by hunting and roaming
from one place to another and gathering what
they could consume as food. Therefore, they
spent mostly a nomadic life during the whole
year. During heavy rainy seasons they lived in
natural caves.
Their population consisted of a collection of
small groups. Normally one group comprised of
between 15–25 members. The maximum number
of members in such a group was believed to be
around 50.
It seems that an area of 50 square metres was
enough for a family consisted of five members.
The area of the place called Church Hill, belonging
to the Stone Age found at Bandarawela is 150
square metres. It is assumed that 25 people might
have lived in that place. The area of the place,
where the community belonging to Stone Age of
Bellanbendipelassa lived in 120 square metres.
Thirty human skeletons have been discovered
from that place.
The nature of the food that the people in that age
consumed was decided by the resources available
in the environment where they lived. During the
dry season they spent their time in camps which
they built temporarily in open areas.

shown in the above illustration, they were arranged by
attaching to a piece of wood or a bone of an animal.

belonged to the middle-stone age in Sri Lanka. They have

uru’.
Key Features of the Settlements
The prehistoric man in Sri Lanka got expanded
by undergoing adaptation to environmental
conditions different from each other. They
preferred to live in places where there were
abundant natural resources needed for food. It
has been discovered that they had lived in and
around the places such as lowland rain forests,
dry zone forests, coastal lagoons and creeks, and
hill country grasslands. They preferred to live in
areas where there was easy availability of water
and various types of stones for making their stone
tools. They had lived in open areas in dry season
and in natural caves during rainy seasons. Given
below are several prehistoric outdoor camps and
cave habitations, discovered so far.
1. Minihagalkanda, Bundala, Pathirajawela
(Outdoor camps in the coastal areas)
2. Pahiyangala, Batadombalena, Kithulgala Beli
Lena (Lowland wet zone caves)
3. Pothana and Aligala in Sigiriya
(Lowland dry zone caves)
4. Bellanbendipelessa
(Outdoor camps in lowland wet zone)
5. Bandarawela, Horton plains
(Outdoor hunting places in hillside areas)
Illustration 2.2. It was a custom of the prehistoric man to bury the dead body of a family member or a relative, who lived
with them, in the same cave in which he or she had lived. Evidence has been found that after some time, they exhumed
the skeletons and applied red ochre stones on them and performed a kind of a ritual activity.
They walked a distance of about 7 kilometres
per day searching for food. As they lived a
temporary life in caves, on some occasions they
buried the dead bodies of their relatives inside
the cave itself. On some occasions they had dug
a pit with a piece of horn or a stick for the burial.
Next, they had placed the dead body in the pit
and covered it up with garbage. 12 skeletons were
discovered in the cave of Belilena in Kithulgala
buried in this manner. In the graveyard of
Bellanbendipelessa, which was an open area,
there were 30 skeletons which belonged to
the Stone Age. 9 skeletons, which belonged to
different Ages, were discovered in the cave in
Pahiyangala.
Food Style
Many evidences of the nature of food of the
people who lived in the Stone Age are found in
the caves in lowland dry zone and in the caves
in wet land. According to the evidences found
so far, they had hunted animals such as gaur,
buffalo, black bear, wild boar, deer, spotted deer,
porcupine, hedgehog, hare, stag, giant squirrel,
mongoose, wild fowl, monkey, civet cat and
iguana for food. They had caught and eaten
fresh water fish which were full of protein. They
had caught small fish in natural water pools in
lowland wet zone for their food.
To get starch they ate some plant food such as
wild breadfruit and wild plantains mainly. Some
evidences have been found in the cave ‘Belilena’
in Kithulgala about seeds of the wild breadfruit
which had been baked and eaten 12500 years
ago. In addition, some food full of starch such as
yams ‘ Gonala, Katuala’, seeds of ‘Kithul’ and the
kernel of ‘Dothalu’ were eaten. Evidences have
been found in a few examined places that food
had been eaten after being baked.
get salt they needed for their food. The remnants
of the lagoon oysters found in Kithulgala
Belilena have been identified to be mixed with
salt brought from coastal areas.
Technology
The stone tools are the only proof that exists to
know about the technology of this era. But it
is difficult to construct a complete idea about
the technology of the Stone Age on the basis of
gem mines in Rathnapura and the stone tools
discovered from the Iranamadu Formation. The
reason for this is the unavailability of enough
stone tools and the inadequacy of available
knowledge on the time of them.
The stone tools in small size, which are called
geometric micro stone tools by the archaeologists,
help gain a descriptive knowledge on the
technology of the Stone Age. These have been
named so because the people who attempted to
produce these stone tools had given geometric
shapes to them.

Sri Lanka. This has been made of a piece of bone of an
animal.
The prehistoric people preferred to eat snails.
Specially, they had eaten tree-snails and oysters
living in lagoons. The prehistoric people who
lived in the inner parts of the country went far to
Fig. 2.4. A human skeleton which represents the pre-history in Sri Lanka. This was discovered in the Pothana cave close to
Sigiriya. ( The photograph is by courtesy of the Postgraduate Institute of Archaeology)
Such a kind of tool is not more than 4.5 cm in
length. They had used more quartz and a little
of ‘Kahanda’ stones to make these micro stone
tools. As a whole, non- geometric micro stone
tools were made mostly. They had been made
in a way appropriate to the purposes of hunting
animals to cutting, scratching, chopping and
digging. Apart from these, some tools such as
hammers and grinding stones had been made
using granite.
Nature of People’s Physical Body
The skeletons discovered so far help us to
understand the size or the stature of the people
who belonged to the Stone Age. Generally, the
height of a grown male was 174 cm. A grown
female was not more than 166 cm in height. The
teeth of all of them were big in size and they had
a wide nose and a chin. The size of the brain of
a grown male was 1600 cm3. It was 920 cm3 in
a grown female. According to the view of the
anthropologists, the maximum lifespan of the
prehistoric man may have been about 35-40
years.
Rituals
Clear information of the rituals that existed in
the Stone Age is found at least to a certain extent
regarding the burial of dead bodies in that era.
A clear instance which reflects an effort taken to
do such a task has been discovered in the cave
of Rawana Ella close to Badulla. A skull of a
man perforated dividing it into two was found
in an excavation there. The rough edges and
the parts protruded outside the skull had been
rubbed, leveled and one side of it painted with
red ochre. Several parts of human skeletons,
painted with red ochre, have been discovered in
the cave in Pahiyangala. These evidences clearly
show that the dead bodies had been buried
somewhere and kept for some time until they
decayed; later the skeletons had been dug out
and buried back. The skeletons discovered in
the cave called ‘Batadomba Lena, in Kuruwita
had been curled and buried. Researchers have
pointed out that there are a number of cultural
and biological similarities between the people
who lived in the Stone Age and the aborigines
(Vedda community) in Sri Lanka.
Fig. 2.5. This is a pre-historic cemetery. This was discovered in the premises of the Kolambageara Ranchamadama
government school in the Rathnapura district of the Sabaragamuwa province. This was discovered during excavations
done in 2007. The cemetery had been used around 3350 years ago.

in Sri Lanka on a map.
2.2 Settlements in Proto-historic Era
The period between the end of the prehistoric era
and the beginning of the historic era is named as
the proto-historic era. Technologically this was
an era of transition. The proto-historic era in Sri
Lanka is differentiated from the prehistoric era
that existed in Sri Lanka before proto-historic
era on the basis of several facts. Some practices
such as using burnt pots and following a
methodical burial system are prominent among
them. Using iron instead of the technology of
stone tools existed during the prehistoric era,
was started during this period. However, using
stone tools was completely given up during the
final stage of the proto-historic era. This age is
called the proto-historic Iron Age as well as the
early Iron Age, as using of iron began in this era.
And also the beginning of building permanent
settlements and starting agriculture are some
more transformations that could be seen in this
period.
Illustration 2.3. Clay urns with remains of burnt dead
bodies inside them were deposited in the burial boats
made of clay. It was a kind of ritual performed by the
people of this country from ancient time.
Fig 2.6 In these clay tub burials, used in the proto-historic
era to perform rituals for the dead, human skeletons were
cremated. Later the remains were deposited after putting
them into clay pots. This clay tub burial was discovered in
the proto-historic burial ground in Ranchamadama.
The Origin of the Proto-historic Era
The knowledge that we possess at present on
the transitory period between the beginning
of the proto-historic era and the end of the
prehistoric era in Sri Lanka is limited. The
changes such as dying down of the technology
of stone tools, hunting including the subsisting
method of gathering food and tendency towards
depending on plant food mostly and using iron
could not have happened suddenly. On the other
hand, there should be a strong cause for such a
transformation. Long term geographical changes
have influenced such cultural transformations in
other countries. Archaeologists and experts on
ancient climate have pointed out that a climatic
change, which affected the entire South Asian
region, had occurred between 7000 – 4500 B.C.,
which is called the middle of the recent geo-
period or Holocene era. That is, at the end of the
Ice-Age, a suitable environment was created for
agriculture due to the increase of temperature in
the world. Moreover, the population increased
considerably and a new social style was created.
The oldest proof about the proto-historic era
of Sri Lanka belongs to 2400 B.C. According
to the archaeological explorations carried out
so far, clearer proof regarding this era has been
discovered in the north-eastern part of the
Sabaragamuwa province and the south-western
part of the Uva province.
The megalithic burials constructed for the dead
in this country are a prominent source that can
be used to study the culture of proto-historic era
of Sri Lanka. Such megalithic burials have been
discovered from several areas in the country.
(Refer - Map No. 2.2)The burials, which were
made out of stone splinters in the shape of
squares, were covered with huge stone slabs.
Some pots containing human remains had been
deposited inside these burials. These are called cist
burials. Among those cemeteries Ibbankatuwa
megalithic burial located close to Dambulla
in the Central province, Galsohonkanaththa
burial in Yapahuwa and the Yatigalpoththa
burial located close to Galewela have now been
excavated. According to their scientific dating,
they belong to a period between 750 and 450
B.C. Proofs about several burial methods which
had belonged to the megalithic tradition have
been found in Sri Lanka. Among them, some are
methods in which the remains were deposited
in a clay urn and buried. Those tombs are called
‘urn burials’.
Archaeological excavations have been done
in two burial grounds, which belong to the
proto-historic era, in Beragala and Haldummulla
in the Uva province. In these burial grounds
the remains have been deposited in a different
manner. Instead of a nucleus made out of
connecting stone slabs, the method followed
there was depositing the clay pots of remains in
a tub made out of raw clay in the shape of a boat.
Before depositing remains, human skeletons
have been cremated in these clay tubs. As a result,
these clay tubs were burnt well. That is the reason
that has affected them to remain for a long time
without perishing.
Fig. 2.7 A stone casket - type- tomb found from Ibbankatuwa burial ground, close to Dambulla. Clay pots containing ashes
of dead human bodies have been deposited in this burial ground.
The Nature of the Settlements
The main feature of this era is that the
people abandoned their hunting livelihood of
pre-historic era and built permanent settlements
as well as habitations. The major evidence
that reflects this characteristic introduced as
sedentism is the remnants of houses that have
been discovered so far. Archaeologists were
able to find such a house in a village called
Udaranchamadama in Rathnapura district in
2009. That house is 10.20m X 6.80m in size and
of rectangular shape. Its front and back had been
separated with a wall. The walls of the house
were made of wattle and daub and the roof was
thatched with something like ‘Iluk’.
Illustration 2.4. A drawing which displays the house that was built in Udaranchamadama in 1129 B.C. This was created
according to the foundation discovered in the excavation.
Life Style
Still there is no enough evidence to get an idea of
the nature of the life style in the proto-historic era
of Sri Lanka. So far excavations have only been
done in burial grounds, and therefore, the
evidences on the general life style during that
period are limited. The information gathered
in excavations
Udaranchamadama assists in getting some idea
on this.
in the residential place
In Udaranchamadama a house, which was
built around 3000 years ago, was excavated. A
number of potsherds were discovered inside
the house. Among them there were a lot of
painted potsherds. The white background of the
outside and the bottom side of the pot had been
beautified by painting red lines. In the manner
in which lines have symmetrically been painted,
it is sure that it was made by using a potter’s
wheel. Other potsherds of such a pot were found
in an excavation done in a residential place in
Haldummulla.
There were several tools in the kitchen of the
excavated house. Among them, there were some
stone tools and iron tools. As many of the tools
of that collection are stone, it seems that using
iron tools had been a new experience for them
by then. Among the other debris in the kitchen,
there remained the bones of animals which
were hunted by the inmates of the house for
their meals. These bones belong to animals like
deer, cattle, wild boar, and giant squirrel. These
evidences show that although they got used to
an agricultural life style, they did not completely
abandon hunting.
Among the other things found in the house, there
were a few clay beads, an iron stick used to apply
kohl on ladies’ eyes, two brown stones (ochre, one
yellowish and the other reddish in colour used
to colour the body and two grinding stones to
Fig. 2.7. The painted clay pot, dated 1129 B.C., found in the ancient house in Udaranchamadama. This instance clearly
shows that Sri Lanka had the technology of making pots from very ancient time. The picture on the right hand side displays
the early shape of the same clay pot.
Activity 2
rub on the brown stones. These evidences show
that the women who lived during that period
were interested in beautifying their body.
Technology
The beginning of the transformation of metal
technology and making clay pots from stone
tools used in the prehistoric era took place
during the period called as proto-historic era.
Since using iron as a metal started, the people
of this era had an opportunity to do their day-
to-day activities efficiently. As iron was a strong
metal, they could do activities such as clearing
jungles, digging the ground and ploughing
easily. The painted clay pot found in the old
house of Udaranchamadama reflects the high
technological standard of making clay items
that existed in that time. As building houses was
started, the technology related to that gradually
increased. Specially, setting the foundation in a
way that sinking does not happen and building
walls levelled to the ground belong to it. A clay
bead has been discovered in the excavation in
Udaranchamadama house. That shows that
the technology of making beads existed in that
period. A highly skillful technology is needed to
make a bead.

historic era in Sri Lanka on a map.
2.3. The Settlements in Early Historic Era
information
The information which describes the early
settlements in the historical period of Sri Lanka
has been mentioned in the historical sources.
is not sufficient
Though that
to definitely identify the areas where those
settlements existed, it provides a considerable
assistance to understand the nature of those
settlements. The archaeological sources are
the evidences that assist us to obtain a definite
understanding about the expansion of the
ancient settlements in this country and other
relevant information.
The early historical period was between 450 B.C.
and 300 A.D. The expansion of the small village
tanks is the main index that shows in which areas
the settlements in this country expanded during
this period. There are thousands of such kinds
of small village tanks in the form of ruins found
around Sri Lanka today. In the historical period
majority of the settlements existed mainly close
to a tank. The archaeological field explorations
have discovered that such kinds of villages were
located at one end of the bund of the tank, close
to it.
Fig 2.8. Several pits for pillars which belonged to a rectangular foundation of a hut. This was discovered in the excavations
made in the old interior city of Anuradhapura. (The photograph is by the courtesy of the Archaeological Department).
Factors that Influenced the Expansion of
Settlements
One of the major factors that affected the
expansion of ancient settlements was the
geophysical background. The elements such as
the rate of annual rainfall, nature of the soil, geo
diversity, expansion of natural resources and the
drainage etc. are prominent within this factor.
The settlements in the early historical period
spread in the areas where there was a dry climatic
condition. The areas where there is an annual
rainfall between 1000 – 1250 ml is called the
dry zone and the areas where there is an annual
rainfall less than 1000 ml is called the arid zone.
Though it was difficult to receive sufficient
amount of water for agriculture during the
entire year, the early settlements expanded in
the dry zone because of its fertile soil. The red
- brown soil which is spread mostly in the dry
zone is extremely good for agriculture. There
were two ways in which these areas received
water for agricultural activities; the major one
and Gallena temple in Kurunegala
district. The meaning of the word
‘Awarana’ is ‘Amuna (anicut)’.
The Structure and the Nature of
Settlements
The settlements, which spread in
the areas outside the overflowing
river valleys by being centralized
on small tanks which were fed by
rain water, were independent from
one another. The settlements which
developed
themselves around a
tank are referred to as ‘Vapigama’ in
literary sources. ‘Sumanavapigama’,
‘Viharavapigama’, ‘Hundirivapigama’,
and ‘Kadahavapigama’ are some of
the villages around tanks mentioned
in Mahawamsa.
Fig 2.9. Several pits for posts of a circular foundation of a hut, found in an
excavation done in the old interior city of Anuradhapura.(The photograph is

was monsoon rain; the water received from
rivers too was considerably useful during the
dry seasons. But, when using river water for
agricultural activities, tasks such as constructing
anicuts across rivers and making canals to carry
gathered water to necessary places had to be
done. As it was a task which required labour,
time, and technology, they tended to save water
by constructing tanks.
From the results of the detailed studies on the
way how the expansion of settlements occurred
in early historical period, it manifests that early
settlements in the historical period in this
country expanded not in the river valleys, but in
the outside areas of them. The main reason for
this was that there was not a suitable technology
to control the catastrophic annual floods from
the rivers. It must have been at the end of the 1st
century B.C. or during the 1st century A.D. when
they started controlling floods by constructing
anicuts across rivers and taking water to tanks.
During the ruling period of king Ilanaga (33 -43
A.D.), who constructed Tissamaharama tank, an
anicut was built across the Kirindi river. There
is a word ‘Avarana’ inscribed on the Brahmi
inscriptions in two caves in Ganekanda temple
One village was separated from the other by a
jungle- belt. Apart from the villages around tanks,
there are short descriptions about the villages,
independent from one another, in historical
sources. Some settlements where different types
of professionals lived in have been mentioned in
the historical chronicles (Vamsakatha) and the
inscriptions in this manner;
1. Kasikaragama - villages where farmers lived
2. Manikaragama -villages where people worked
in gem mines lived
3. Gopalagama - villages where cowherds lived
4. Kewattagama - villages where fishermen
lived
5. Kumbhakaragama - villages where potters
lived
6. Vadtakigama – villages where carpenters
lived
Apart from this, there were several villages
existed on the basis of tasks.
7. Pattanagama - villages situated close to
harbours
8. Niyamgam - trading villages
9. Olagam - villages around tanks deserted by
people
Map 2.3. This map shows the distribution of the oldest village tanks and the early epigraphs in Sri Lanka. Since there was
a close relationship between the village, the tank and the epigraphs, the distribution of the tanks reflects the expansion
of ancient settlements.
Map 2.4. A map which displays the distribution of ancient settlements around Kirindi Oya, which flows near Tissamaharamaya,
which belongs to Hambantota district. (the dots in the map represents settlements). The settlements which are far away
from the river valley belong to the time between 900 and 500 B.C. Those settlements were the first ones originated in the
area related to that river. The settlements close to the river spread after implementing a strategy to control the annual
flood of Kirindi Oya.
Illustration 2.5. This is an imaginary drawing of an ancient village in Sri Lanka. Living mutually with nature and the simplic-
ity that was found in people’s life style as a result of that are prominent features of the rural life.
It is difficult to come to a definite conclusion on
the size of the ancient settlements. It was based
on the abundance of natural resources prevailed
in various geographical areas. But, according
to the evidence found in the archaeological
research carried out so far, a small scale village
was normally not more than 0.15 hectares.
A medium scale rural settlement was about
2 hectares in size whereas a large scale urban
settlement was more than 2 hectares.
Normally there lived 5 or 6 families in a village.
Literary sources say that around 30 families
lived in some large scale villages. This situation
was completely different in urban settlements.
It has approximately been calculated that by
the 6th century A.D. there was a population
around 35000 in the ancient ‘Magama’ city and
the adjacent urban settlements. Literary sources
say that some villages were protected by a fence.
Those villages were called ‘Parikkitta Gam’.
The villages which did not have such type of a
protection were called ‘Aparikkita Gam’.
To introduce vast urban settlements the name
‘Pura (city)’ was used. There is a title called ‘ Pura
Kamatha’ mentioned in a Brahmi inscription
written in a distant time such as in 250 B.C. It
referred to the main architect in the city. The
word ‘ Nurupura’ was written in the Panakaduwa
copper plate which belonged to the period of
King Vijayabahu I (1055-1110 A.D.) to introduce
Anuradhapura.
The most ancient inscriptions in this country
mention a certain type of settlements called
‘Nakara’ alias ‘Nagara’. Here the word ‘Nagara’
had been used for a certain settlement that
came between city and a village. Taking the
commodities produced
in the villages for
trading in big cities, was coordinated by these
intermediate settlements. They were slightly
bigger than a village.
There are evidences to prove that the organization
and the administration of these settlements were
systematic even before the early historical era. A
village was a unit consisting of several families.
The family was the most important feature of
a village. A family was represented by the chief
householder. He was known as "Gahapathi" in
Brahmi inscriptions. A person who acted on
behalf of a group of a few chief householders of
a village was called ‘Gamika’ or ‘Gramika’ which
means 'the chief of the village'. At a later period
a panel consisting of ten chief householders was
engaged in solving administrative issues in an
area joined with ten villages. In inscriptions this
panel has been introduced as ‘Dasa Gam Eththan’.
An inscription at an old Buddhist temple called
Kaludiya Pokuna in Dambulla in Matale district
says that if there was any problem regarding the
supply of ‘Dane –Alms giving’ in that temple,
‘Dasa Gam Eththan’ should get together and
solve the problem.
foundations, which had belonged
Several
to ancient rural houses, were discovered in
excavations done in Anuradhapura. Their walls
were made of wattle and daub and roofs were
thatched with leaves. Some houses, among
them, were of round shape. Some of the houses
had square foundations. The archaeologists have
found only pits for the pillars of these houses.
Some marks of an ancient house were discovered
in a village named Walagampaththuwa
Tissamaharamaya. The floor of that house was
set after digging the ground and then applying
clay on its surface afterwards. It has been
scientifically proved that the house was used in
the 3rd century A.D.
You were able to learn the nature of the ancient
settlements of this country. You should keep in
your mind the way in which they had managed
to shape their lives properly and collectively
from very ancient time.
Means of Subsistence
The means of subsistence of the people, who
lived in the areas outside the overflowing river
valleys, was chena cultivation. Chena crops that
grow in dry zones such as Kurakkan, Meneri,
sesame, and Thanahal were cultivated in them.
Those crops, which had a cluster of short roots
and were well sustainable to the drought, were
also conducive to be grown in the areas outside
the overflowing river valleys. They had tended to
construct basic village tanks as the production
of food had to be increased in parallel with the
increasing population in the settlements. More
water was needed for more agriculture. A clear
reflection of how the early historical settlements
started outside the river valleys entered into river
valley settlements can be given from a study,
done in Kirindi Oya valley, on old settlements.

Write the differences of the fundamental
features of settlements in the prehistoric,
proto-historic and historic eras in Sri Lanka.
Important Facts
 Settlements of Sri Lanka started several
hundred thousand years ago. Those who made
their early settlements in this country were
Homo Sapiens.
 Early Homo Sapiens
lived by adapting
themselves to diverse environmental zones.
Therefore, they lived in many places in Sri Lanka.
They did not reflect any racial identity.
 The time period in which the early people’s
culture existed is known as the prehistoric era.
During that time their main livelihood was
hunting and gathering food by roaming.
 During that time, they had stone tool
technology. They were used to make equipment
out of stones such as alabaster and Kahanda for
their day-to-day use. The pre-historic era is also
known as ''Mediaeval Stone Age''.
 There are evidences that the prehistoric
people engaged in agriculture later. According
to available proofs, that transformation had been
complete by 2400 B.C.
 Making pots, using burial grounds and using
iron metal were started during this era. This age
is known as proto-historic era.
 Proto-historic era becomes an important
age because the basics which are related to the
development of Sri Lankan civilization started in
this age. The people of this country started to live
in villages during this era.
 According to Mahawamsa, there was a well
organized society in Sri Lanka when Prince
Vijaya and his retinue came to this country.
Iranamadu Deposit (Formation)
There was an extremely rainy climate in Sri Lanka during
the cool periods of the Great Glazier Era. During this time
higher places underwent immense soil erosion. The eroded
soil from the hilly areas deposited on lowlands. There is a soil
belt, settled in this way, stretching 32 kms from the sea coast
to the interior parts of the country. This soil layer is known as
Iranamadu Deposit (formation). The reason for giving that
name to it is that because this soil layer was clearly identified
in the area near the tanks in Iranamadu for the first time. The
stone tools, used by the prehistoric people, were found in this
soil layer.
The Archaic Homo Sapien
Homo Sapien means the present human family. The earliest
of this human family originated about five hundred thousand
years ago. The term 'Archaic Homo Sapiens', is used to name
the earliest of the Homo Sapiens, who lived during the time
period between 500000 and 200000 years.
Micro Stone Tools
The small sized stone tools used in the recent period of the
prehistoric era are known by this name. The length of a micro
stone tool made of alabaster or Kahanda stones is about 1 cm
to 7cm. A piece of stone broken out of the above mentioned
stone was shaped until it got a sharp edge. After that it was
attached to a piece of wood or an animal’s bone. Cutting,
scratching and drilling were done by using such tools.
Overflowing Valley
Heavy rainy seasons cause floods. On these occasions both
banks of the river are submerged with water. The area of either
side of the river which goes under water is called overflowing
valley. The alluvial brought by the flood water settles in the
overflowing valley. Therefore that area is highly fertile. The
term ‘Delta’ is also used to name the overflowing valley.
3 Evolution of Political Power in Sri Lanka
Introduction
Historical sources say that this country was
ruled by many kings and a few queens in the
ancient time. Historical sources describe that
prince Vijaya who came from India was the
first king who ruled this country. He arrived in
this country in the 6th century B.C.
evidences
archaeological
substantiated that there had been settlements
in this country even before the arrival of
prince Vijaya. The ancient burial grounds
discovered in the areas such as Beragala and
Haldummulla have proved that an agricultural
society had been in a developing state in this
country from 2400 B.C. There must have been
a certain ruling system in such a society for
it to exist without any chaos. Therefore, the
history of evolution of political power in the
society of this country belonged to the period
before the arrival of prince Vijaya.
The authority to rule a country is entrusted to
a king or a queen by the people of that country.
Whoever it is, he or she needs people’s consent
to rule a country. The history has taught us
how some rulers, who ruled the country under
people’s dislike, did not have the ability to rule
the country for a long time. As a ruler had
the consent of the majority of people to rule
a country, the word ‘Mahasmmatha – general
will’ had been used to introduce such a king
in the eastern countries in the ancient time.
The ruling land reigned by a king or a queen
on the people’s will (Jana sammathaya) and the
various officials who were engaged in ruling
and the people is called a state.
3.1 Pre-state Era
According to the interpretation given above, the
foundation of a state in the Sri Lankan history
developed at a later time. It has been described in
the next parts of this lesson. Here, the attention
has been paid to explain the nature of the ruling
system that existed in Sri Lanka before it became
a state. That period is called pre-state era.
inscriptions
There was no one definite ruler to rule this
country during the pre-state period. Instead,
a group of wealthy chieftains dominated their
power over small areas. At the beginning of
writing
in this country these
chieftains were introduced in them by the name
of ‘Parumaka’. The word ‘Parumaka’ is derived
from the Sanskrit word ‘Pramukha’. Its meaning
is ‘main’. They were given the power to rule a
large or a small area based on the power they
possessed as a result of their wealth.
There is an inscription, which assists us to show
that the Parumakas had a certain provincial
power, in Kothgalakanda in the Kandalama
area close to Dambulla. That inscription
belongs to 250 B.C. A Parumaka who offered
a cave to the bikkus has been introduced as
“Thota Bojaka”. Its meaning is “Theerthaya
Anubhava Karanna”. ‘Theerthaya’ means ‘the
port’. The word "anubhava kirima” was used
in ancient language to mean “collect taxes
and enjoy properties”. It can only be done
by a person who has a ruling power. It is
clear that the Parumaka mentioned in the
Kandalama inscription was one who ruled
that area. Therefore, he had the ability to offer
a cave to the Buddhist monks. By examining
Illustration No. 3.1. One among the householders in a village was appointed as the chief of the village. He was called
‘Gamika’. The activities between each village were coordinated by the Gamikas.
how the Parumakas came into being, we can
easily understand the way in which the political
power of this country evolved. In order to
understand that, the ancient rural society in this
country and its operation should be meticulously
studied.
Householders
there
important
information
in which
regarding that was discovered in the area called
Periyapuliyankulama. It says that “a householder
who was engaged in metal trade, had cleaned
a cave and offered it to the Bhikkus for their
comfort”. Those householders offered themselves
in common activities in a village representing
each family. In simple terms, the householders
meant chiefs of the families.
At least by 900 B.C. the rural settlements of
this country had spread in many areas in the
dry zone. These villages consisted of several
families. Perhaps between 1 to 30 families lived
in those villages. In the ancient time the word
‘Kula’ was used to mean a family. The chief of
all these families was called ‘Gruhapathi’. In the
inscriptions made in 250 B.C and later, the word
'Gahapathi' was used for them. An inscription
The Gamikas
inscriptions as well as
The ancient
annotations have mentioned a group of people
called ‘Gramika’ or ‘Gamika’. They were the
chiefs of the ancient villages. The ancient villages
existed separately. A belt of jungle area separated
one village from the other. Because of this
separation the people who lived in each village
thought about the villages as ‘our village (the
village where they live)’, neighbouring village
(adjoining village) and the outside villages (the
villages existed far away). The one, who acted
representing each village in the affairs between
villages such as marriages, exchanging goods, as
well as solving problems, was named as Gramika.
Its meaning is the chief of the village.
A chief, to represent a village, was selected
among the householders. In the selection, the
priority may have been given to the wealth and
the possessions of the householders. The Jathaka-
Attakathawa tells us a story of borrowing a bag of
paddy by a poor man, who lived in an ancient
village, from the Gamika in the same village
on the promise that he would return it on the
following season. It reveals that Gamikas were
rich enough even to help others.
To control a group properly, the person who
has won the common trust of that group should
provide the leadership to it. Our ancient villagers
had acted to appoint the richest and the most
powerful person as the chief of the village in the
Map. 3.1. The tanks in the villages were connected
through canals in order to widen the use of small tanks
which obtained rain water. The word ‘prolapsed-tanks’ is
used to introduce that kind of a tank-system. The people
in the dry zone of Sri Lanka use the word ‘Ellangawa’ to
name it. This map shows that kind of a ‘prolapsed tank
existed in Hambantota district.
instead of
agreement of the householders
taking decisions by all the householders in the
village getting together. Buddhagosha Thero
has mentioned in Samantha Pasadika that the
Gamika was one who was appointed among the
householders themselves.
Providing leadership to the common activities in
the village was especially important among the
tasks done by the Gamikas. Maintaining the tank
of the village and distribution of water from it
was prominent among his tasks. It is clear that a
ruling power was built around him as a result of
solving problems in villages, giving leadership to
the activities and the wealth he possessed.
As the chiefs of those villages acted mutually
with each other, they were able to maintain the
peace and the co-existence between the villages.
An evidence to prove this was discovered in a
cave in the area called Korawkgala belonging
to the ancient Buddhist temple situated in
Sithulpawwa in Hambanthota district. Three
people had participated in cleaning that cave and
offering it to the Bhikkus; they were Gamika Siva,
Gamika Sumana, and Gamika Thidana. These
three people must have been the chiefs of the
neighbouring villages adjacent to Sithulpawwa.
The origin of such chiefs of villages was a decisive
milestone in developing the political power of
this country.
The Parumakas
We mentioned earlier that a group of chieftains
called Parumakas was important regarding the
development of the political power in the society
of this country in the ancient time. Here, it is
important to find how such kind of a class of
chieftains emerged and how power was claimed
by them.
The notion of all the scholars, who have studied
about this fact, is that there was a relationship
between the emergence of the chieftains and the
maintenance of ancient tanks. Certainly, how
did that happen?
In about 900 B.C. the settlements spread in the
dry zone mainly around small tanks. These tanks
received water from rain. Normally, the water
in those tanks was enough for 10 or 15 families
who lived in a village for their day-to-day needs
for a short time period. In annual dry seasons
the water in those tanks ran dry. We can say that
the people might have faced difficulties in such
times by the experiences faced at present by the
people of the dry zone.
The problem of not having adequate rain water
collected in the tanks arose not only due to the
dry climatic condition. With the passing of time
more water was needed due to the increase of
population in villages. Since they had to cultivate
more lands in order to produce more food for
the increasing population, collecting more water
was essential for them. Our ancient villagers,
who faced such difficulties a number of times,
followed a successful method to address those
challenges: they constructed a system of tanks
by connecting a few tanks, which existed closely,
through canals. There were two objectives in it; the
first one was conserving water by carrying water
to a tank situated below from a tank situated up
when it overflowed during the rainy season; the
second was increasing the dampness of either side
of the land of a canal by sending water constantly
through the canal between the two tanks. They
were able to cultivate crops easily by increasing
the dampness in such a manner. Even today the
ruins of such tank systems could be seen in the dry
zone. The word ‘prolapsed tanks’ is used to name
such kind of a tank system. People in the dry zone
call it ‘Ellangawa’. The origin of tank – systems was
not merely a process of connecting a few tanks;
Fig. 3.1. The Ibbankatuwa burial ground (cemetery) in Dambulla was used between 700 and 450 B.C. The burial grounds
like these were used by the influential people like the Parumakas.
something important was happening behind it.
Earlier we mentioned that the villages were
situated separately in the dry zone. Further, we
said that there was a tank in each and every
village. In constructing tank systems they
connected such independent tanks with each
other according to the contour lines of water
flowing. Therefore, it was natural for the chiefs
of the villages to discuss and there emerged the
need of taking important decisions regarding
connecting tanks in their villages. When the
most ancient inscriptions are read meticulously,
it can be seen that the most powerful person
among the Gamikas had acted to represent all
villages of the tank – system. This person was
called by the name of ‘Parumaka’. Since the
Parumakas had the power to take decisions on
behalf of the welfare of the people who lived in
several villages belonging to the tank- system,
they were considered to be a group of important
chieftains in the then society.
Even today ruins of hundreds of such tank –
systems could be seen in the plains in the dry
zone. It is clear that there was a Parumaka for
each tank – system during the time they were
used. There is information on hundreds of such
Parumakas in inscriptions. Not only men, but
also women too were engaged in provincial
administration on some occasions. Such women
were called in the name of ‘Parumakalu’. As a
whole, all of them were people who ruled the
small land units in the areas where settlement
had spread in the dry zone. Accordingly, the
evolution of political power in Sri Lanka started
as a divided system. The best word that can be
used to name such a method is ‘decentralized
ruling’.
Illustration 3.2 The chiefs of the Gamikas were called Parumakas. They had the right to collect taxes. The Parumakas
symbolize an important beginning of developing the political power in a later time.
(oriental)’. There is another note about such
another provincial king named ‘Duhathara Raja’
in a cave in the ancient Buddhist temple called
Yatahalena in Kegalle.
The word ‘king’ gives the meaning of ‘one who
makes others happy’. Therefore, the word ‘king’
is used to refer to ‘one who works for the people’s
welfare diligently and make them happy. As the
Parumakas acted in such a manner, later they
were named thus. The origin of a generation of
brave kings, who ruled Sri Lanka, occurred in
such a background.
Growth of Kingship
The growth of kingship means centralizing the
power which was decentralized.
Centralizing political power in a country means
a country being united. This means that power
comes under one person. When the power is
centralized, the concept of state is created. Its
ruling head is the king and he has a specific
territory under his ruling.
According to historical sources, the first king
who ruled this country was King Pandukabhaya.
According
Mahawamsa, king Pandukabhaya,
the description given
Fig 3.2. This necklace which was discovered in the
Ibbankatuwa burial ground belonged to the period
between 700 and 450 B.C. This is a bead necklace and
some of the beads in this were imported ones. The luxury
of the growing rich Parumakas is reflected by this.
In this manner, the Prumakas who exercised
the provincial ruling in this country were so
powerful that sometimes they went to the extent
of introducing themselves in the term of ‘King’.
An ancient inscription in the area called Embul
Ambe in Matale district mentions a provincial
ruler called Pochani Raja which means 'the king
of the eastern region'. Pochani means ‘Pracheena
1. ascended to kingship by fighting several
provincial rulers (his uncles) and captured those
areas.
2. selected Anuradhapura as his ruling centre
and built up the city of Anuradhapura.
3. marked the rural borders during his tenth year
after the accession to kingship.
The need of centralizing the political power was
gradually emerging by the ruling period of king
Devanampiyatissa. One of the main reasons that
influenced this was the trade affairs growing in
the Indian Ocean. It was not only because of the
geographical location of Sri Lanka, which was
situated in the middle of the sea trade route that
connected western countries with the eastern
countries, that it became an important to the
international traders. Gems, tuskers, and spices
that Sri Lanka possessed had become attractive
commodities for them. In joining this emerging
international trade, the need of working as an
independent country arose. Therefore, the then
powerful provincial rulers had understood the
need of bringing the country into a unitary rule.

King Dutugemunu managed to establish a centralized
ruling by combining the Parumakas who were enjoying a
decentralized power.
Mahawamsa says that king Devanampiyatissa
had invited the Kshasthriyan (the clan of trade)in
Katharagama and Chandanagama to participate
in the ceremony of planting the Sri Maha Bodhi.
Not only that, we know the king took steps to
plant a branch of Sri Maha Bodhi in various
parts of the country. By this act it becomes clear
that the king had thought of the need of building
affability among the regional rulers. Holding
coronation of King Devanampiyatissa again
by using the five insignia of royalty sent by the
powerful emperor king Ashoka who ruled India
and using the title ‘Devanampiya’ of emperor
Ashoka, arrival of Mihindu thero bringing
Buddhism to Sri Lanka are facts that reflect
the nature of relationships maintained with the
countries in the Indian oceanic region.
King Dutugemunu was another pioneer in
the process of centralizing the decentralized
political power of Sri Lanka. The king received
the support of the Parumakas for that. Examples
to prove this can be seen in the inscriptions
belonging to his ruling period.
The army generals who extended their support
to King Dutugemunu to unite the country had
worked as Parumakas before they were given
the above mentioned posts. The names of the
army generals such as Velusumana, Pussadeva,
Theraputtabhaya,
and Nandimithra were
mentioned in the inscriptions as Parumakas.
Several such inscriptions can be seen in the caves
in Situlpawwa. King Dutugemunu obtained the
support of such Parumakas and centralized
the power, which was decentralized so far. The
regional chieftains, who were the Parumakas
during the time when the power decentralized,
became persons who held different posts
after the power was centralized. The names of
Parumaka Pussadeva, Parumaka Velusumana,
Parumaka Therputtabhaya
became
Senapathi Parumaka Pussadeva, Senapathi
Parumaka Velusumana and Senapathi Parumaka
Teraputtabhaya. These changed names could be
seen in contemporary inscriptions.

Fig. 3.3. This photograph displays some clay stamps used
in the ancient time. There was not anything marked on
them when they were discovered. Stamps like these were
used by government officers. These three stamps were
discovered in the place where there was the old urban
hall in Tissamaharamaya.
Further, the inscriptions provide us information
about the treasurers, cashiers, and storehouse
keepers who held the post of Parumaka earlier.
According to literary sources, King Dutugemunu
was the first king to unite the whole country.

Sri Lanka. Historical sources say that a Sri Lankan
ambassador had been to Rome and brought
glass beads with him when he returned during
the ruling time of king Bhathikabhaya.
King Wasabha made the centralization of the
political power more successful. During his
time Sri Lanka was ruled as one unit. The
inscriptions established by king Wasabha had
spread in a wide area in this country. Further,
separating administrative districts (asthana) and
appointing ministers to administer each district
too were done during his ruling time. It has been
written in the golden plate, ‘Wallipuram’ that
the Jaffna area was ruled by a minister named
Srishigiri appointed by the king in his time.
During that time Jaffna peninsula was known as
Nagadeepaya (Nakadiva).

before the world because of its centralized
political power.

a great Pooja to Ruwanweliseya. This statue can be seen
in the premises of Ruwanweliseya even today.
3.2 The Concept of State
The king, created by the centralized political
power,
is an extremely powerful person.
Therefore, the king had appeared before the
people in a majestic form. The rulers thought their
duty was developing the country economically,
providing security to the countrymen, and
enhancing spiritual development of the people.
Providing security on the occasions of threats
from foreign enemies, developing the economy
irrigation and enhancing
by constructing
people’s spirituality by building religious places
were some examples. The history provides
evidence to prove how even kings such as Elara
and Nisshankamalla, who had foreign origin,
acted in the above described way and won the
trust of the people.
Different concepts about kingship developed
according to the actions of the king and the
way that they attempted to appear. Accordingly,
concepts
Bodhisathwa,
Parvatharaja, Veerathwa, and Chakravarthi were
applied to the kings.
like Devathwa,
Most frequently the king appeared either as a
Bodhisathwa or as a god. The king Kutakanna
Abhaya, who made the inscription in a rock in
Dambulla temple, has introduced him by the
name of ‘Nareshvara’ (Naraisera). Its meaning is
god Eeshwara for humans.
King Mahasen was worshipped as God of
Minneri due to his service of developing the
economy by constructing irrigation works. Even
today there are Devalas in the dry zone dedicated
for God Mahasen.
King Kashayapa I appeared as Kuwera. The name
‘Alakapaya Maha Raja’ had been used to call
him. The meaning of it is ‘Alakamandadhipathi –
Maha Raja’. ‘Alakamanda’ is the living place of the
god ‘Kuwera’ who is in charge of wealth. Literary
sources say that ‘Alakamanda’ was a huge rock.
The rulers in ancient Asia followed the method
of appearing in the concept of ‘Parvatharaja’.
The king, appearing as a Bodhisathwa was
another instance. The king showed, on one hand,
that he was bound with responsibility to rule the
country in a just and fair manner for the benefit
of the people and, on the other hand, it reflected
that the people should trust and respect the king.
Another view that the kings of this country
held was
‘Chakrawarthi’.
Chakrawarthi is a concept which conveys the
meaning of ‘dominating the whole world’. That
the concept of
word belongs to the Sanskrit language and in
Sinhala it is used as ‘Sakvithi’. Some rulers in
this country had used this word to show their
identity in the 8th and 9th centuries A.D. Specially,
king Nishshankamalla used the line “Kalinga
Chakrawarthi Swaminwahanse” to introduce
himself in his inscriptions.
Though there were various terms about the
kingship, all of those concepts were used to show
the superiority of the king. When such type
of nobleness is applied to the ruler, the people
expected him to be exemplary. It is natural for
him to be persuaded to act as that. That is how
the conceptual background was created, which is
essential for a righteous ruling.
Inheritance of Kingship
When we study how the kingship was inherited
in ancient Sri Lanka, it seems it passed from
brother to brother or from father to son.
After the demise of king Devanampiyatissa, his
brothers ascended to the kingship. After king
Dutugemunu, his brother Saddhatissa became
the king. When the kingship was given to a
brother, the eldest among the younger brothers
of the king was given power. When it was not so,
history provides evidence to the fact that there
were conflicts for the kingship.
What was frequent was passing the kingship
from father to son. After king Kawantissa,
prince Dutugemunu became the king; after king
Vasabha, his son prince Vankanasikatissa became
the king. In this way passing kingship from father
to son can be seen throughout the history of Sri
Lanka. Either king’s elder son or the consort’s
elder son became the heir. There are evidences
that there were conflicts when it was not so. We
know that king Kashyapa usurped the kingship
from his father, king Dhathusena. The king had
to do so because prince Mugalan, who was the
son of then king’s consort, was the real heir to
the throne. The mother of prince Kashyapa was
a second queen of king Dhathusena. Apart from
this, there were occasions when the kingship
went to the brother of the king’s consort and
the son of the king’s sister. It happened so when
there was no real heir as described above.
Statecraft
During the time when the political power was
decentralized many of the Parumakas were
combined together and built the state. The king
acted as the head of all the Parumakas. Therefore,
the word ‘Mahaparumaka’ or ‘Mapurumuka’ was
used to name the king. We earlier mentioned
how some powerful Parumakas used the name
‘king’ before the power was centralized. But,
after the centralization of political power in the
country, the word ‘Maha Raja’ was used to name
the ruler of the country.
By referring to the most ancient inscriptions
of this country, we can fairly understand the
structure of the officials, who belonged to the
state administration which developed after the
centralization of the power in Sri Lanka.
The king – Maha Raja (Mapurumuka)
Chief Minister – Maha Emathi
(Mahamatha)
Ministers – Emathiwaru (Ametha)+
Commanders (Shenapathi)
Treasurer – Bhandagarika (Badagarika)
Architect of the city (Nagara Wudika)
Officer in charge of the horses (Asa Adeka)
Officer in charge of tuskers (Hathi Adeka)
Officer in charge of dramas (Nata Adeka)
Officer in charge of making coins (Rupa Adeka)
Officer in charge of trades (Pana Adeka)
Officer in charge of archives (Kanapedika)
This kind of official structure provided a good
assistance to the administration of the country.
Common people were ones who benefited much
from this.
3.3. Great Kings Who Ruled This Country
From the facts discussed so far, you must
have understood how the development of the
political power in Sri Lanka was influenced
by a socio – economic process. Specially, the
rulers who, had understood that they needed
an efficient centralized ruling more than a
decentralized one if they wanted to gain the due
benefits from international trade affairs afoot in
the Indian Ocean during the latter part of the
1st century B.C, took necessary steps for that.
In this part it is expected to discuss the policies
and contributions of the rulers who ruled
this country, in parallel to the development of
political power in Sri Lanka, citing several kings
as examples.
Officer in charge of the Dining Hall
– (Bathagu)
King Dutugemunu
Officer in charge of customs
–(Kothuruge na)
Administrator of the city
-(Nagaragutika)
King Dutugemunu, who is highlighted in the
historical sources, was a ruler who rendered a
great service to organize the political power in
this country properly. The king understood the
need of saving Mathota international harbour,
which earned a good income because of the
trade affairs which was prospering in the Indian
Ocean during his time, from the then king Elara
who had usurped the power in Anuradhapura
and uniting the country. The way that prince
Dutugemunu acted for that purpose according to
the advice and the plans of King Kavantissa, his
father, was a landmark in the political history of
this country. Prince Dutugemunu was the first to
provide leadership to the first organized fighting
movement in the history of this country. The
statement that he made about his fight against
King Elara, which he would do, not because that
he wanted to enjoy comforts and the facilities of a
king but because for the benefit of the Buddhism
clearly shows how the ruler entered to the
political process based on a common purpose on
behalf of the country. After the battle, the king
ordered his subjects to respect his defeated rival’s
tomb, which shows his statesmanship.
As we have explained in the part ‘growth of
kingship’ of this lesson, the most important
contribution that King Dutugemunu made to
the process of development of political power
in this country was managing to combine the
Parumakas who had possessed the decentralized
provincial power by then. At the end he
possessed a great power after being anointed as
the king (Maha Raja) of the country. Though he
was so powerful, his redressing attitudes towards
the people reflect that he could realize his prime
responsibility which was to work for the welfare
of the people. The best example for this is that
during the construction period of Ruwanweli
Stupa the king ordered to run alms halls (Dan
Sel) at the four gates of the Stupa and make
payments for everyone who had participated
in its construction works. King Dutugemunu
should be admired not merely for his service
to Buddhism of this country. Taking initiatives
to organize the decentralized political power in
Sri Lanka is also a prominent feature among his
tasks.
King Vasabha
King Vasabha, who was the first ruler of the lineage
(dynasty) of Lambhakarna, was a prominent
character among the rulers of this country. The
procedure that the king followed to regulate
and to organize the internal administration of
the country properly was exemplary. There are
a number of inscriptions that he has established
around the country. According to the information
in them, the king tried to divide the country
into provinces and regulate the administration.
And also, inscriptions say that the process of
collecting taxes of the state was made systematic
during the king’s time.
The details of the historical sources reveal that
King Vasabha pioneered in constructing large
scale tanks in this country for the first time. The
Wamsakatha (chronicles) say that the king had
constructed sixteen large scale tanks. The king
tended to execute such kind of construction as
there was a great demand for the grains produced
in this country in South India because there was
a dearth of food in the valley of Krishna river
in South India. The immediate decision king
Vasabha took to invest the public money on
constructing new reservoirs can be analyzed as a
far-sighted and a productive decision to address
an international and regional need emerged at
the time.
The way that king Vasabha acted to reconstruct
the Buddhist temples and Stupas in this country
is not second to any other ruler’s task. A number
of inscriptions mention the financial support the
king provided to reconstruct the decayed places
in Buddhist temples and to supply facilities to
the Bhikkus.
We should understand that the decisions that the
king made to make the lives of the people better
in the country by taking steps needed to increase
the local income and using the income earned
in that manner to develop the irrigation of the
country are exemplary.
in a way in which maintaining the relationships
with Eastern region of India could take place
easily. Though ex-rulers had paid their attention
on this before, king Vijayabahu I was the one
who acted practically regarding the matter.
One of the main reasons that appear to have
affected to select Polonnaruwa as the ruling
centre was the Trincomalee harbour, which was
named Gokanna Thiththa during that period,
was located facing the Eastern part of the South
Indian ocean and he understood that controlling
of the trade affairs of that harbour could be done
easily from the Polonnaruwa ruling centre.
The way king Vijayabahu I acted as a ruler
influenced much on the history of Sri Lanka
during the Polonnaruwa period. The sovereignty
of this country, which was preserved until it was
threatened by the Europeans, was a result of the
intelligence and great ideas of the rulers of that
time.

King Vijayabahu I
King Vijayabahu I is another prominent and a
great ruler who belongs to the history of this
country. The king acted to suppress the power
of Chola through a war movement planned in a
very intelligent manner during a period in which
Sri Lanka was under the Chola ruling for a long
time after the growth of power of the Chola kings
in South India.
The King was called Keerthi in his childhood
and grew in Ruhuna area. The royal family
including prince Keerthi and his parents were
given protection by a public officer who lived
in Ruhuna. He was Sithnarubima Budhal Na by
name. He was a security officer. An interesting
description of the way that Budhal Na provided
protection to the royal family is included in the
Panakaduwa copper plate which had been got
written by king Vijayabahu I.
All the steps taken by king Vijayabahu I to
act against the powerful Chola kings was an
effective fruitful procedure followed to protect
the existence of the whole territory in the
country. The concepts of freedom of territory in
any country and continuity are called territorial
integrity. The protection of the territorial integrity
of a country by a ruler is a prime responsibility of
him for the citizens.
The king, who united the country by defeating
the Chola rulers through a fighting movement,
took much pain to develop the country. He acted
immediately to renovate the Buddhist temples
which were not maintained properly during the
period of the Chola ruling. The king took a very
important step to strengthen the economy of the
country; that is, making Polonnaruwa his ruling
centre instead of Anuradhapura. The king took
such a step because the international trade based
on the Western areas of India by then had been
transferred to the Eastern Indian region. With
that transferring, what was very important for
Sri Lanka was to organize the administration
 In running the rule of the country, the rulers
appeared in different types of concepts. Most of
the time they attempted to appear as a god.
Pancha Kakudha Bhanda – Pancha Kakudha Bhanda means
the five items which are considered to provide prosperity when
they are used. The Walvidunava, Mirivedi Sangala (a pair of
slippers), Magul Kaduva (king’s sword), Sesatha (Parasol),
Nalal Patiya (the strap tied on the forehead) belong to it.
Kings used them in their coronations. Mahawamsa says that
king Devanampiyatissa held his second coronation using the
Pancha Kakudha Bhanda sent by emperor Ashoka.
The title Devanapiya – Indian emperor Ashoka used the
title Devanapiya (Devanampriya) meant ‘adorable to God’.
King Tissa, who ruled this country in the contemporary
period of emperor Ashoka, used this title and called himself
Devanampiyatissa.
Alakamandava – Literary texts describe that Alakamandava is
the dwelling place of the ‘Kuvera’ who is in charge of wealth.
Accordingly, it is one of the prosperous cities which belongs to
the island ‘Uthurukuru’ where gods live.
Important Facts
 At the early stages the political power in
Sri Lanka was in a decentralized nature. The
chieftains who were powerful provincially
handled the ruling power.
 Those who were engaged in ruling affairs at
the village level were called Gamikas and those
who ruled a wide area consisted of several villages
were named as Parumakas. Gamikas represented
the householders who were in charge of several
houses in a village. The word Gahapathi was
used to name them.
 A political body is needed to control power
which is necessary to handle the conflicts and
other complexities in a society, which are caused
due to the facts such as life competition caused
by emergence of various social requirements
in line with development of settlements. The
political power in the ancient society of Sri
Lanka developed based on such needs.
 The process of centralizing the political
power, which had been decentralized in this
country, was initiated by king Dutugemunu.
That task, initiated by king Dutugemunu for a
political purpose for the first in the history of
this country, was accomplished by King Vasabha,
who was a member of the Lambhakarna lineage.
 Centralizing the power means the ruling
power of the country goes to one hand of one
ruler. There a group of officers are appointed to
run the administration of the country. The word
state is used to name the king, the officers, the
rules and regulations imposed by them and the
institutions which put them into practice.
4 The Ancient Society of Sri Lanka
Introduction
The majority who live in any society at any
given time is the general public. Rulers,
government officers, religious leaders and
other chieftains are a minority among the
people. History is the past that reflects
the activities of all of them. Though that
is the truth, many of the historical source
information
descriptions have presented
paying more attention to the minority that
we mentioned secondly. Therefore,
knowledge of information about the ancient
general public is limited. If we need to
understand the history of this country better,
it is necessary to learn the information of
lives of the general public who lived during
the ancient time. In this lesson you will have
an opportunity to learn all this with more
information.
4.1 The Nature of Ruling
The historical sources say that kings ruled our
country in the ancient times. The inscriptions
mention very important information about
the procedure of the statesmanship followed in
ruling the country.
institutions which handle
There are three
the ruling of any country. They are called the
legislature, the executive and the judiciary. The
government means these three institutions. The
legislature is the institution which makes laws in
a country. As it is done by the parliament of our
country today, in the ancient time it was done by
the king’s court. The executive is the institution
which implements laws. The government officers
are engaged in that process. The judiciary
provides the justice to the countrymen by
preventing the damage caused to the society due
to breach of law.
In the ancient time there were an executive as
well as a judiciary in our country. The executive
acted as the legislature too. There was not an
independent body as a separate legislature,
because then there was monarchism in this
country. The inscriptions written in 9th century
A.D. had used the word ‘Ekthensamiya’ to
name the executive and the legislature. In an
inscription in the place called Buddhannehela
there is a note which could be put into words
such as “Apa methuwak dena awud wathhimiyan
wahansege wadala ekthensamiyen”. The word
‘Ekthensamiya’ is formed from the words ‘Eka
asthana’ and ‘Samya’. The word ‘Eka asthana’
‘Samya’ means
means
‘agreement’. Hence, the word ‘Ekthen Samiya’
gives us the meaning ‘agreement of the king’s
court’. The
inscription Buddhannehela was
established to make a statement of an offering of
a land. The phrase of the inscription mentions
that the offering was made with the agreement of
the king’s court and due to the decree of the king.
The phrase “Wath himiyan wadala” means the
“king’s decree”. The word ‘Wathhimi’ is a similar
word to king.
‘king’s court’ and
According to the inscriptions that belong to
the 9th century A.D., the officers, who came to
grant the land of the government to the Buddhist
temples, had represented a place called ‘sabhava
– the council’. As mentioned in one of the
inscriptions found in Anuradhapura district the
officers named Udaya in Meningamuva and Sena
in Nikawella had come representing the council (Sabhawa)
to offer a plot of land called Kerelegama to the nunnery
called Mahindarama. It goes like this in the inscription,
“Sabhayen a meningamu udahi isa nikaweli senu isa”.
Here the word ‘Sabhawa’ means the judiciary existed
then. It is a legal act to bequeath land of the government
to another. Therefore, the participation of the officers,
representing the judiciary, in such occasions was essential.
On such occasions demarcating the borders of the given
land and documenting the conditions that should be
followed in enjoying the land must have been the duty of
the officers.
In the literary sources the word ‘Mahale’ has been used
in several places instead of the word ‘Sabhawa’. That was
how the old Sinhala word ‘Maha Lekhaka – great writer’
was written. It is similar to the meaning ‘Maha Lekam
– general secretary’. The duty of the secretaries of the
government was to document all governmental affairs
and take necessary steps to preserve them. An inscription
found in Medirigiriya mentions about such a general
secretary. The inscription says that a general secretary
(Mahale Kasba) called Kashyapa had come to offer a land
to a Padhanaghara called Eth Wehera in Medirigiriya and
to do the legal affairs of it under the decree of King Sena II.
When Anuradhapura was the capital of the country, it was
the ruling centre too. The king ruled the country from the
capital. It is clear that as there were no transportation and
communication facilities like today, therefore handling
the administrative affairs of the remote areas from
Anuradhapura was difficult. There are facts that can be
seen in literary sources about separate administrative units
related to the government for provincial administration
because of the above reason. An example which can be
given for that is the golden plate - ‘Vallipuram’ written in
King Vasabha’s ruling period. It has been mentioned in
the document that a minister called Rishigiri, who ruled
Nagadeepa during king Vasabha’s ruling period, built a
Fig.4.1. Several symbols in an inscription written in the 9th century A.D. Here, the
mark ‘ Vatapatha (fan)’ indicates the sceptre which symbolizes royalty; the mark
‘Wela (creeper)’ indicates the swan. The swan symbolizes the purity of the given
allowance. The crescent mark at the top symbolizes that this allowance persists
until the sun and the moon exist. The marks of the dog and crow symbolize that
those who disturbed this allowance would be born as those animals in their next
birth.
temple called Piyangukatissa there. This clearly
shows the manner in which the officers of the
central government had been appointed to rule
the outer areas.
Apart from these, there were independent
councils, which were at lower levels to administer
each area. In the inscriptions, those independent
councils, which existed in 9th century A.D., have
been introduced as ‘Dasagam Ettan’. The heads
of them had participated in the administrative
affairs at a minor scale, representing ten villages.
An inscription situated in an old temple called
Kaludiya Pokuna in Matale district says that if
there was a problem regarding offering alms to
the temple, Dasagam Ettan should gather and
solve the problem.
In administration, the rulers of the country
acted for the welfare of the people. They not only
offered grants to the temples, but also acted for
the betterment of the countrymen. Especially,
the rulers frequently paid their attention to uplift
the health facilities of the general public, which
was essential to them. The word ‘Vejjasala’ has
been used in ancient literary sources. That word
means ‘hospitals’. The inscriptions made in the
2nd century B.C. mention about doctors who
were called ‘Veja’.
King Buddhadasa (340 – 368 A.D) was a ruler
who made a great effort to build hospitals. King
Mahinda V (982 – 1029 A.D) acted to provide
everything required to the hospitals in various
provinces in the country then. During the reign
of king Kashyapa IV (898 -914 A.D) a dangerous
fever spread in and around Anuradhapura.
Historical sources say that the king who realized
that those patients could not be treated under the
facilities available in the hospital existed then,
built a special hospital for that. For that the word
‘Upasaggaroganasa’ was used in the sources.
King Upatissa I (365-406 A.D.) built maternal
hospitals for the needs of the pregnant women.
Those hospitals were named as ‘Paswantinama
Sala’. That word means ‘the halls built for the
delivery’. In the inscriptions those buildings were
named as ‘Thimbirige’. From an ancient time,
there was the tradition of building maternal
hospitals in this country. There was a type of halls
called ‘Sottisala’ during king Pandukabhaya’s
reign. The annotative texts describe that the
name ‘Sottisala’ was used by Brahmins for the
places where religious activities were performed
and to name the maternity hospitals.
relations with
The intelligent kings, who ruled our country
maintained mutual
their
neighbouring countries as well as with distant
countries. The countries with which relations
were maintained, changed from time to time.
Relations were maintained with Asian countries
including India and Araby since a very long time
and with some European countries since several
centuries from the recent past. Inscriptions in
the South India mention that King Gajabahu I
(114-136 A.D.), who was a reputed ruler from
the ‘Lambhakarna’ lineage had arrived in ‘Chera’
state in South India to participate in a ceremony
where a ‘Pattini’ Devala was declared open.
Perhaps the purpose of this journey might have
been to strengthen the mutuality of statesmanship
between two countries.
sent ambassadors
Mahawamsa mentions that king Bhatikabhaya
(23B.C-7A.D.) had
‘Romanuka Desha’. Here
‘Romanuka Desha’
means Rome. The purpose of this mission was
to fetch glass pebbles for a Pooja performed at
Ruwanweli Seya.
In the 8th and 9th centuries A. D. the rulers of this
country built a close relation with China. During
that time ambassadors from this country went to
China. In the ruling period of king Aggabodhi
VI these relations were very strong. During that
time twenty foreign missions went to China.
The success in trading was the basic background
of the relations built with China and it made a
cultural influence too.
relations with
Sri Lanka had marital
neighbouring countries. This reflects another
way that Sri Lanka maintained its foreign
relations. Specially, there is information in the
Wamsakatha about marital relations that our
rulers had with powerful Indian states such
as Kalinga, and Pandya. King Vijayabahu I
(1070-1110) married a Kalinga princess named
Thilokasundari and the king’s sister princess
Miththa married a Pandyan prince. It seems
that the fundamental purpose of these marital
relations was to maintain the political power
with stability through relationships.
Though there were differences in languages and
religions, acting with trust with the neighbouring
countries were one of the prominent features of
the foreign policy of our rulers. The best example
for this is that King Vijayabahu I appointed the
Veleikkara army for defense of the Polonnaruwa
Temple Tooth. Veleikkara force was a mercenary
army which came from Southern India and
served in Sri Lanka for payments.
After the 10th century A.D., our kings had a
mutual relationship with Arabian countries.
The purpose of that must have been giving Sri
Lankan contribution stably for the trade affairs
done by the Arabian traders in the Indian Ocean.
As it is mentioned by the Arabian historian Al –
Balasuri, who lived in the 9th century A.D., the
king of ‘Ruby Island’ (Sri Lanka was called by this
name) had exchanged gifts with the Islamic king.
If it is summarized, the main purposes of the
ruling in this country were creating a peaceful
co-existence among the countrymen, providing
their welfare and protecting the territorial
the motherland
integrity
and future longevity of the countrymen. In
parallel to them, it seems that they have acted
with a farsighted vision to work in a mutual
understanding with the neighbouring countries.

4.2 Economy
The majority of the people lived in villages. In
comparison to the present condition, those
villagers’ lives were shaped up in a very simple way.
Most of their occupation was agriculture. Some
were engaged in Chena cultivation whereas the
others were engaged in paddy cultivation. They
reared animals for living. Apart from these, some,
who were engaged in different occupations, lived
in villages completely separated for themselves.
4.2.1 Farming/ Agriculture
The main livelihood of the villagers who lived
in the ancient Sri Lanka was farming. Animal
husbandry or rearing animals was also done in
line with the agricultural activities. Agriculture
was done in two ways; one was muddy agriculture
alias paddy cultivation; second was Chena
cultivation. The historical and archaeological
sources substantiate that the Chena cultivation
was the oldest out of these two. The term
‘Hena’ (Chena) used in ancient time has been
mentioned as ‘Sehen’ in Buthsarana, the literary
text, ‘Sen’ in Ummagga Jathaka, and ‘Pitibim’ in
inscriptions.
Chena Cultivation – ‘Hena’ or Chena cultivation
is an inland cultivation. A suitable land for
‘Hena or Chena’ is prepared for growing grains
and vegetables after choosing a plot of land
from a jungle area, clearing it by cutting small,
trees, undergrowth and thorny bushes in it and
burning them after they dried. In this process the
farmers would not cut big trees. Before setting
fire to the cleared jungle area, the owner of the
Chena shouts out in order to chase away animals
from that area.
Fig. 4.2. A scene of a newly arranged Chena (Nawadeli Hena)
A new chena, which has been cleared by setting
fire to it, is called as ‘Nawa Deli Hena’. Those
Chenas are fertile. The term ‘Nawadeli Sena’ has
been mentioned in ‘Saddharma Rathnawaliya’
too. In some parts of Sri Lanka, a different
meaning is given to the term ‘Nawa Deli Hena’. It
says the term ‘Nawa Deli Hena’ is used for Chenas
where the nine plants namely, finger millet
(Kurakkan), Kollu, Undu, green gram(Mun),
Corn (Iringu), millet (Thanahal), dill seeds
(Asamodagam) and Amu have sprouted in
lush. The villagers in Anuradhapura use the
term ‘Kanaththa’ to name the Chenas which are
prepared to start cultivation again after giving it
up for some time. The normal method practised
in Chena cultivation was abandoning a certain
Chena after cultivating it for once or twice. As it
is abandoned for some time, it grows wild again.
Therefore, old Chena cultivation did not do any
harm to the environment.
The seeds such as Undu, Ma, Green gram (Mun),
finger millet (Kurakkan), Corn (Iringu), Sesame
thala, amu, mustard (Aba), dill (Duru), and
millet (Thanahal) as well as vegetables such as
Karabatu, Thiththabatu, Brinjal (Vambatu), ash
pumkin (Alu puhul) and pumpkin (Wattakka)
were cultivated in Chenas. Al vee (a type of
paddy), yams, Uk Gas (sugar cane) and Kapu
(cotton) were cultivated in Chenas separated for
them. During that time the cultivation of sugar
cane and cotton was rich enough to produce
jaggery and clothes needed for the country. The
Wamsakatha mention that there were labourers
engaged in sugar cane industry. Our ancestors
were able to produce jaggery needed within the
country itself for a long time. The scholars point
out that until the 16th century A.D., sugar was
not imported to this country.
As a Chena is cultivated in a place which is away
from farmers’ houses, they stay temporarily in
a hut built in the Chena until it is harvested.
The fence, which is normally made out of sticks
around the Chena to protect its crops from the
Illustration 4.1 A Chena is a beautiful scene. The hut, which was built for the farmer to stay at night to protect the Chena
from wild animals, the fence made with sticks around the Chena are things that can mostly be seen.
wild animals, is called ‘Dandu Weta’. The small
hut built at the top of a tall tree in the Chena is
called ‘Pela’. It was in this ‘Pela’ that the farmers
stayed sleeplessly at night to protect the crops in
their Chenas from wild animals.
During the times of some kings, taxes were
charged for cultivating Chenas. Two types of
such taxes, ‘Kethi Ada’, ‘Ketu Kanaba Aya’ have
been mentioned in inscriptions. The inscriptions
say that King Nissankamalla (1187-1196 A.D),
who ruled in Polonnaruwa, abolished those two
types of taxes.
Since there was not much population in ancient
time, Chena cultivation was enough to meet the
needs of their lives. Muddy or paddy cultivation
was started in order to produce more food
required for the increasing population.
inscriptions
Paddy Cultivation –
places where paddy was cultivated have been
introduced as ‘Kumbura’ and ‘Ketha’. Sometimes
the word ‘Kumbura’ may have been used to
introduce the small space which was used for
paddy cultivation. The term ‘Ketha’ has derived
from the Sanskrit word ‘Kshesthra’. It meant
'considerably big fields'.
Mostly the paddy cultivation was done by using
irrigation. During monsoon seasons, rain water
was reserved in tanks. Then the water was
carried to paddy fields through canals. Twice a
year paddy was cultivated. The seasons in which
paddy was cultivated were introduced in the
name of ‘Kanna’. The two ‘Kannas’ (seasons) in
which paddy was cultivated were called ‘Maha
Kannaya’ and ‘Yala Kannaya’. Apart from these,
another one introduced as ‘Meda Kannaya’ is
found in inscriptions. It came between ‘Yala
Kanna’ and ‘Maha Kanna’ and also depended on
the abundance of water.
4.2.2 Industries
The main need of the dry zone to maintain
paddy cultivation successfully was to supply
sufficient water. Gathering rain water and taking
water through canal to paddy fields by putting
a barrier across the natural rivers were the two
strategies followed. The tradition of making
tanks developed in this country as a strategy to
face the need of preserving water. The statement
uttered by king Parakramabahu the Great (1153
– 1186 A.D.) as “Not a single drop of water
that falls from the sky should be sent to the sea
without properly using it” shows how the ruler
saw the importance of preserving water.
Unlike at present, farmers in the past were
conscious of doing various customs in the
paddy cultivation. It provided them with much
assistance to be engaged in their livelihoods by
being close to the nature.
Animal Husbandry – Apart from agricultural
activities, there was animal husbandry too.
Rearing cattle was the major activity in it. The
inscriptions mention Gopalagams, which were
reserved for those who were engaged in cattle
rearing. What was taken from cattle was very
helpful for food. Mee kiri (milk or curd), Githel
(ghee), Wendaru (butter), were prominent
among them. There is a word “Kirigeri” in an
inscription, made by king Kashyapa IV, in the
Colombo Museum. What it means is the cattle
reared for getting milk. A nice carving of a
woman who gets milk from a cow has been
engraved on the rock ‘Mahameru’, which was
settled in the ancient Stupa of the temple named
Nagapabba in Sigiriya.
Apart from cattle, chicken and goats were reared
in houses. There is an inscription, written in the
9th century A.D., at the hospital in Padhanagara at
Ethvehera temple in Medirigiriya, Polonnaruwa.
It is mentioned in the inscription that for needs
of the patients only the flesh of naturally died
chicken and goats should be used.
You learned in previous lessons that from very
ancient time the metal industry of Sri Lanka was
highly developed. There is some information
about artisans who worked in their industries
using iron. Among them, blacksmiths were
prominent. The name ‘Kabara’ was used to
introduce them in inscriptions. That is how the
word ‘Kammara’ was written in old Sinhala. The
blacksmiths were very essential and important to
the villagers. He was the one who made pruning
knife (Keththa), mammoty (Udella), and plough
(Nagula) for them. In an inscription in a place
called Muthugalla in Polonnaruwa, there is a
reference about a blacksmith named Majjima.
Apart from this, there were artisans who
were engaged in their industries using copper
(Thabakara) and tin metal at that time. The
word ‘Thuladhara’ had been used to introduce
goldsmiths in ancient documents. In some of the
books they have been described by the name of
‘Swarnakara’. An inscription found in the place
called Mandagala in Hambantota district, there is
a reference about a goldsmith named Thuladara
Sumana. Things such as bead and badges, made
of types of half gems and gems, found in old
cities such as Anuradhapura and Magama from
the archaeological excavations reflect the nature
of the gem industry existed in the society of this
county. The artisans who were engaged in such
affairs were called ‘Manikara,.
Another industry, which existed in the ancient
society of this country, was the art of carving on
tusks. An inscription situated close to Vegiriya
Devalaya mentions a craftsman of tusks named
‘Datika Sumana’. The term ‘Datika’ comes from
the word ‘Danthika’.
Earthenware was the most useful ones for the
ordinary people, who lived in those days, for their
day-to-day activities. A large number of remnants
of such earthenware have been discovered in
archaeological excavations. Making earthenware
was a well organized industry at that time. Even
the inscriptions written more than 2250 years
ago mention about those who were engaged in
pottery. Then they were named ‘Kumbhakara’
(Kubakara).
In an inscription in a place named ‘Veherakema’
in Hambanthota district a word named
‘Thathvaya’ appears. This term is a combination
of the two words ‘Thanthu Vaya’. Its meaning
is ‘one who spins strings’. Spinning strings is
related to weaving clothes. Historical sources say
that weaving clothes was an industry that existed
in our country from ancient time. The reference
of the spinners of strings mentioned in the
Veherakema inscription is an obvious evidence
that proves the cloth weaving industry existed at
that time.
By mentioning information about artisans who
were engaged in different types of industries
such as these occupations in our history, it
appears that the ancient society of our country
was well organized. All these artisans made a
contribution out of their knowledge and labour
to run the society well.
4.2.3. Trading
In ancient time there were only a few number
of cities. According to sources, Anuradhapura
and Magama were prominent among them. To
call them the word ‘Pura’ has been used. The
rich lived in big cities. There were both local and
foreign traders in those cities. At the southern
gate in Anuradhapura, there was a bazaar called
‘Kalasumana’.
Trade was a major occupation in our country
during ancient time. Trade activities were
maintained locally as well as with foreign
countries. An inscription in the western water
park of Sigiriya mentions about a person
called ‘Abala Wapara’. That is the way how ‘sour
business’ was written in old Sinhala language.
It is a ‘tamarind trader’ that was introduced
thus. That inscription had been written 2250
years ago. Except for a small group, others
worked by organizing themselves collectively.
That kind of organization was addressed by
the name ‘Poogaya’. In some places the word
‘Niyamasthana’ has been used for that.
Those who were engaged in trade were called
‘Wanija’ or ‘Vapara’ in those days. The word
‘Vapara’ was the old Sinhala term of ‘Vyaparika
– business’. These traders were the rich in the
ancient society. They had even offered caves for
Bhikkus to stay. An inscription in the place called
‘Mandagala’ in Hambanthota district mentions
that a trader called ‘Sumana’ had offered such a
cave. Another inscription was found in a place
named ‘Weherakema’. That inscription includes
a description about an offering of a cave to the
Bhikkus by an organization of those who did
their trading by weaving clothes.
There were markets for selling commodities
in trade cities and villages. Literary sources
mention that one Suranimala, who came to
from Mahagrama, bought
Anuradhapura
perfumes at a shop. The information in the
inscription of King Udaya IV (946-954 A.D.)
points out the way how ancient markets were
administered in an organized way.
The best example that can be given for this is
the description given in the Soraborawewa
inscription about Hopitigama market. It includes
the laws imposed by the king on its administration.
There is a law mentioned in it which commands
that taxes should be charged only from the carts
which come to the market, but not from the carts
which go passing the market. A law has imposed
stating that betel should only be sold keeping in
a hut covered from the sun. It was done in order
to prevent selling dried betel to people. There
were no trading affairs on poya days then. A fine
was charged from those who did their business
on poya days. Those did trading on poya days at
the Hopitigama market, had to supply oil to light
lamps at the Mahiyanganaya temple as a fine.
Nilawalathiththa
Map 4.1 Old commercial cities and ports
The Tamil inscriptions, found in Sri Lanka, which
belonged to the period from the 11th century to
the 13th century A.D., mention that there were
several South Indian trade organizations afoot
in this country during the same time. Nanadesi,
Valagngniyar, and Ayinurwur are some of them.
A metal stamp, which belonged to the trade
organization named Nanadesi, was discovered
in Hambantota.
There is enough evidence to prove that there
were a considerable number of foreign traders
in this country in the early period. In an
inscription in a place named Bowaththegala in
Southern Province, there is a term “Kajoba Maha
Pugiya”. It is about a big trade organization of the
Cambodians. The Cambodians were traders
who came here from Afganistan.
From ancient time our country played a
significant role in international trade affairs.
One reason that affected for this was Sri Lanka
was located in the middle of the Indian Ocean.
The contribution that Sri Lanka made as an
exchanging center in the East-West trading in
the ancient time cannot be belittled.
One of the specific factors that contributed
to develop as a city was
Anuradhapura
international trading. In the West Mathota
harbour was located where as Gokkannathiththa,
known as Trincomalee harbour today, was situated
in the East. Apart from these, the actions of small
harbours situated on the western and eastern
coasts made a direct influence on the emerging
urbanization of Anuradhapura. Bringing Sri
Maha Bodhi from the small harbour named
Jambakolapattana situated in the Northern coast
and bringing the Tooth Relic from the small
anchorage port called Lankapattana situated in
the Eastern coast by prince Dantha and princess
Hemamala to this country are examples for this.
 Teachers
Teaching profession too was another occupation
in ancient Sri Lanka. In ancient
existed
documents the word ‘Acharya’ has been used to
introduce teachers. Not only those who taught
crafts, but also those who excelled in education,
were named as ‘Acharya’. These Acharyas were
good at different types of crafts. The inscriptions
mention information about teachers who trained
taming tuskers (Hasthi Acharya), going on
horseback (Ashwa Acharya) and shooting with
the bow (Dunu Acharya).
 Doctors
To run a society well, the citizens who belong to it
must be healthy. The service of the doctors is very
important for that. In the Anuradhapura period
medical profession held a high recognition. The
word ‘Veja’ was used to introduce doctors in
inscriptions. In the 9th century A.D. some doctors
had been named as ‘Maha Vedana’. Such a term
was used to name the chief doctor or surgeon.
 Lawyers (Legal Advisers /Experts)
2000 years ago there lived professionals who
were conversant with law. It seems that mostly
they gave the required instruction to the king to
achieve justice. Such people who knew about law
were called by the name of ‘Vohara’. It derives
from the word ‘Wyavahara’ in Sanskrit language.
This name was given to the persons who were
proficient in the accepted practices of justice and
goodness in the contemporary society.
 Different Artisans
The persons, who were engaged in different types
of industries and artistic occupations, lived in
the society of this country during ancient time.
The sources mention that there were dancers,
painters and poets among these artists. In an
inscription, found in an old temple in Medagama
in Kurunegala district, inscribed 2200 years
ago, there is a reference about a dancer named
Tissa. Introduction of the wife of this dancer as a
Parumaka is an important fact here. It gives us a
clear idea that dancing had been considered as an
important occupation in the society. The words
‘Chithakara’ and ‘Lapana’ were used to introduce
the painters. The first name had derived from the
word ‘Chithrakara’ and the second had derived
from the word ‘Lepana’. In Sanskrit language
the word ‘Lepana’ is used to give the meaning
‘applying’. Since applying colours create paints,
the word ‘Lepana’ had been used to name the
painters. In an inscription in the place named
Nattukanda, there is a reference to a person
called ‘Lapana Tissa’.
In our country there were highly talented poets.
The word ‘Kavi’ itself had been used to name
them. The son of above mentioned Lapana
Tissa had been introduced as a poet in the same
inscription. His name was Sanjaya.
4.3 Culture
4.3.1 Religion
From the time when Arahath Mahinda Thero
arrived here in the 3rd century B.C and preached
Buddhism, it had continually been the main
religion of this country. Apart from this, with
the arrival of Indian traders and others from
India, Hindu religion too spread in this country.
Christian religion and Islamic religion were
introduced to Sri Lanka at recent times when it
is compared to the spread of Buddhism. It was as
a result of spread of trade in the Mediterranean
region after the 6th century A.D. and in Western
countries centered trade after the 16th century
A.D. in Eastern countries.
Soon after the arrival of Arahath Mahinda Thero
and his followers, Buddhism and the rituals
related to it spread rapidly in the society of this
country. As there were no suitable monasteries
for the daily increasing number of Bhikkus to
Illustration 4.2. The Bhikkus stayed in the cave monasteries, offered by the Buddhist followers and devotees, from early
time of the introduction of Buddhism to this country. Temples and shrines were constructed much later.
Fig 4.3. In the same period when Arahath Mahinda Thero arrived in this country the caves like these were offered to
the Buddhist monks by virtuous devotees. In some of the drip ledges engraved on such caves, there are inscriptions with
the names of those who offered them.
stay, natural caves were cleaned and offered them
to Bhikkus. More than 1600 caves offered in such
a way to Bhikkus can be seen in different parts of
the country.
Meaning- This cave was offered to the Sanga (the
Bhikkus), both who are present and not present
from the four directions, by Chief Sumana, a son
of chief Guptha.
A suitable cave was found, cleaned, made a drip
ledge in order to prevent water from coming
inside during the rainy season and offered them
to Bhikkus. In some caves the details of those
who offered them have been engraved under the
drip ledge on the rock. Those days Brahmi letters
were used for that. Those inscriptions have been
written in old Sinhala language named ‘Sinhala
Prakrutha’. You, who participate in school
educational trips, will have the opportunity
to visit such caves, in which drip ledges and
inscriptions are engraved, in places such as
Mihintale, Ritigala, Vessagiriya and Sigiriya.
Given below here is an inscription in a cave in
Mihintale.
Inscription- Parumaka Gutha Putha Parumaka
Sumanaha Lene Agatha Anagatha Chathudisha
Sagasa.
Apart from caves and temples, sources mention
about certain buildings introduced in the name
of ‘Pannasala’. That means houses made of clay
and wattle and thatched with reeds and leaves.
The Bhikkus stayed in such places, before
temples and monasteries were built with bricks
and granite. The word ‘Pansala’ we use today has
derived from the term ‘Pannasala’.
Several Bhikkus
lived in ancient Buddhist
monasteries. The Bhikkus who lived under the
chief monk were called “Anthewasika Bhikkus-
disciples monks”. An inscription engraved in
a cave in Mahaelagamuwa in Anuradhapura
mentions about a person who was called
‘Athewasika Pussa’. During those days the chief
monks were addressed in the name of ‘Thera’.
In inscriptions the student monks who lived in
association with those chief monks have been
named as ‘Sadivihariya’ or ‘Saddi Viharika’. The
meaning of that term is ‘one who lives close by’.
Until the Thripitaka (three scriptures) was
documented during the ruling time of king
Valagamba, Dhamma had been preserved by
oral tradition. There were monks who had kept
a part of the Thripitaka in their memory. They
were named as ‘Bhanakavaru’. The monks, who
had memorized the scriptures that belong to
the doctrine, were called by the name of the
particular scripture. For example the monks who
had memorized the Deega Nikaya were called
Deega Bhanaka and those who had memorized
the Sanyuktha Nikaya were called Sanyuktha
Bhanaka.
Inviting the monks to stay in the temples during
the rainy season (Vas Visima) and holding
ceremonies for offering robes (Katina Uthsava)
were venerable customs among the people who
lived during those days. In an inscription in the
place called Helambagala in Kurunegala district
the term ‘Vasavasika’ appears. Its meaning is
‘Vassavasika’ or ‘stayed inside during the rainy
season’. In an inscription in Kothalakimbiyawa
in the same district the words ‘Vasavasika
Sahataka’ could be seen. That is how the two
terms ‘Vassavasika Sataka’ have been written in
Sinhala Prakrit language. Its meaning is ‘Katina
Cheewaraya - the woven robe’. It says that cousins
of a monk called ‘Uththiya’ offered a ‘Katina
Cheewaraya – the woven robe’. Both of these
inscriptions belong to a period of 2200 years ago.
4.3.2 Other Religions
There is evidence that Brahmin groups lived
in and around Anuradhapura city during the
time when Buddhism was rooted in the society
of this country. They were Hindu devotees.
Mahawamsatika, which described that there was
a type of buildings, mentioned in Mahawamsa,
in the name of Sottisala, points out that the
places where the Brahmins performed
Fig.4.4. A cross engraved on a
stone post in Anuradhapura.
This belongs to a time after
the Portuguese came to this
country.
their religious activities too were called by that
name. And also, that book, which describes the
word ‘Sivikasala’, points out that it meant the
places where the ‘Shiva Lingas’ (phallus of god
Siva) were established. Those ‘Pooja’ performed
for the God Siva is well-known among the Hindu
devotees. As South India is located close to
Sri Lanka and there prevailed regular trade
relations between the two countries, ideas of the
Hindu religion were brought here. The oldest
inscriptions of this country mention about the
Tamil traders who came to Sri Lanka for trading.
They have been introduced as ‘Dameda’ in those
inscriptions. That is how the term ‘Dravida’ was
written in Sinhala Prakrit language. By the 7th
century A.D.

scripts.
There lived a considerable number

and Koneshvaram temple built nearby
the old harbour Gokannatitta, which
was in Trincomalee were places
worshipped by the Tamil people who
lived there during that time.
An old stone plate, with a cross
engraved on it, has been discovered
in Anuradhapura. That cross belongs
to a catholic sect named Nestorians.
Later the traders who held the ideas of
the Nestorian sect, which developed
centred on Persia, migrated
Sri Lanka through the trade routes. The traveller Cosmos Indicopletus, who belonged to the 5th century
A.D. has mentioned about a group of Persian traders who lived in Anuradhapura.
Fig.4.6 An ancient Shiva Devala in Polonnaruwa.
The scholars are of the view that the stone post with the Nestorian cross found in Anuradhapura was
made after the arrival of the Portuguese to this country.
There are evidences that the ideas belonging to Islam religion prevailed in Sri Lanka in the period after the
9th century A.D. In the ‘Quitab –Al- Musliqval – Mamalik, the oldest Arabic geographical book discovered
so far, has mentioned Sri Lanka as ‘Sarandib’. ‘Sarandib’ was the way that the Arabs pronounced the term
‘Sinhaladweepa’. This book
was written in or around
845 A.D. There was a mutual
relation between Sri Lanka
and Arab from ancient time.
It was a relation which went
beyond mere trade relations.
The book ‘Ajayib Al- Hind,

trade affairs well.
started by
4.3.3 Education
There was an organized method to acquire
knowledge and publicize it in this country from
ancient time. At the early stages knowledge was
passed from generation to generation through
exercise and listening to someone. When we
study the similarities of the styles and finishing
of the clay pots containing burnt human remains
and the clay tub burials built in several places
since 4400 year ago, it is very obvious that the
knowledge on the technology that was needed
to make those things had been gathered in an
organized manner.
As it was mentioned early in this lesson, the
group which is named as ‘Achariya’ in the oldest
inscriptions in our country is teachers. The
things taught by those teachers were mentioned
in the places where they had been introduced.
They have been introduced as “Dhanu Achariya”,
“Hathi Achariya”, and “Asa Achariya”. They
were the teachers who taught archery, the art
of controlling tuskers, and the art of controlling
horses respectively.
After Buddhism was rooted in this country,
Buddhist temples and monasteries became the
main educational centres. The scholarly monks
who stayed in them were fully conversant not
only with the languages such as Sinhala, Pali,
Sanskrit, and Prakrit, but also with the Buddhist
doctrine. From ancient time they were the
teachers in this country.
There was a sense of respect regarding giving
education and receiving education
in our
ancient society. The poem mentioned in the
Lokopakaraya is a fine example for that. It is
given below.
Ru Siri Yowun Guna – Nena Siyallen Noadu Vee
Nodathoth Silpa Satha – Suvanda Nethi Kele
Mala Sama We
The poem says that though someone is young,
wise and pleasant in appearance, he or she is
similar to a wild flower without fragrance if he
or she has no proper education.
4.3.4 Literature and Appreciation
Works of literature belonging to the era of
Rajarata Civilization are written in either one of
the three languages, Pali, Sanskrit and Sinhala.
Dipawamsa, Abhidhammappadeepika
Sarattha deepani are examples for the books
written in Pali. Books such as Janakiharanaya,
Balawabodhaya and Anuruddhasathakaya are
written in Sanskrit. Siyabaslakara, Sasadawatha
and Muwadewdawatha are examples for the
books written in Sinhala.
A poem written by such a poet 2000 years ago
could be seen inscribed in a rock in Kirinda
temple. It’s a free verse which could be read to a
rhythm. Both the poem and its translation are
given below.
The poem inscribed in the stone.
Apirimithe Lokahi – Budha same nathi
Athana parama dulabe – savanuthe pathe
Anuthare sathe – Maha sarane
Lokachaka Budha nama sayabu – Megalahi
Vihare
Naka Uvaraja nama – Budha sarana gathe
Michaditika Bidiya – yahamaga parayana Bhuthe
Its translation:
This world is unlimited – no blessing equal to
the Buddha
He is everywhere – being equal to him is rare
It’s a great blessing – not second to anyone
He is omniscient – is an eye to the globe
Give up being a heathen – select the best path
In this temple – vice king Naga entered the
Buddhist order.
Nearly 600 poems composed during
Anuradhapura period could be seen even today
on the mirror wall in Sigiriya. The sense of
inspiration of those poems is very high.
The poets of our country in the ancient time,
who were disciplined with Buddhist teachings,
composed poems based on the experience
gained from working with the nature constantly.
Hence, the theme of most of the poems was
impermanence. Such an attractive poem has
been written in an inscription, which belonged
to the 9th century A.D, found in the premises
of Abhayagiri temple. The techniques such as
similes used in that poem create a very sensitive
and subtle aesthetic sense in the reader. The
poem says that life is like a ‘Vara’ flower caught
in a wildfire.
You will be able to understand easily the nature
of aesthetic thoughts of the ancient Sri Lankans
by reading, understanding and appreciating the
Sigiri graffiti given below.

It made us frightened.
As our ancestors were engaged in farming and
animal husbandry from a long period of time they
were able to live closely with the nature. Therefore,
they had a simple but deep understanding about
the beauty and the uncertainity of the nature.
As those ideas were further developed by the
teachings of Buddhism, a dispassionate taste was
developed in the ancient society.
4.3.5 Ethnic Co-existence
There are evidences to prove that there lived
people, who belonged to different cultures in the
cities of our country from the ancient time. The
inscriptions point out that apart from the native
Sinhala people, there were groups of people,
belonging to other cultures and beliefs in other
religions, who came here for trading , among
the urban community. Among them there were
traders who came from South India, the Ionians
who came from the Greek and Macedonian
regions, the Cambodians who came from the
Afganistan region, and the Jawakans who came
from the Malayan peninsula.
Though there was much diversity among the
aforementioned nationals, they had never tried
to fight with each other. An inscription found in
Abhayagiri Vihara in Anuradhapura mentions
about a Tamil monk. It was written around
1st century A.D. The ancient people of this
country did not use to look at other nationals
with suspicion. Instead, they worked and lived
with them amicably. An ancient inscription
found in Ampara mentions about a Tamil man
who was married to a Sinhalese woman. The
archaeologists were able to discover a street in
Anuradhapura where several Tamil families had
lived.
The merchants, who migrated from various
countries in the region around the Indian Ocean,
lived in ancient cities in Sri Lanka. However, it
seems that most of them had come from South
India. There was a special post in the king’s court
named as ‘Demala Adhikari’ by the 9th century
A.D. His task must have been to look into the
matters regarding the welfare of the Tamil
people who lived in and around Anuradhapura.
A person named ''Demel Adhikari Pandiradh''
has been mentioned in an inscription of king
Kashyapa IV which is in the National Museum
of Colombo. Among this Tamil community,
most of them were soldiers who served as the
mercenary soldiers in the army in our country.
The oldest kings who sought the assistance of
the South Indian mercenary soldiers were king
Ilanaga (33 -43 A.D) and King Abhayanaga (231
– 240 A.D.) They, who came from Kerala, were
called ‘Agampadi Senawa’. The Wamsakatha say
that King Vijayabahu I had assigned the duty
of providing defence to the Dalada Maligawa
(Temple of Tooth) to Welayikkar force. The
Welayikkaras were the group of Agampadi who
came here from Kerala.
In the 11th and 12th centuries A.D. a group of
merchants named ‘Nanadesin’ who were engaged
in trade affairs in this country were a company
who had a South Indian origin. A bronze cachet
which belonged to them has been discovered
in Hambanthota. An
inscription, written
during the reign of queen Lilawathi, found in
Anuradhapura, mentions about a customs barrier
which had belonged to the group of merchants
called ‘Nanadesin’. According to the historical
records, these merchants had been engaged in
their activities peacefully and the rulers too had
provided much assistance for their welfare and
protection.
Our citizens used to work amicably not only
with the Tamils, but also with the Arabs who
were Muslims. The Sri Pada (Adam’s Peak)
mountain, which was consecrated with the
touch of the foot of the Lord Buddha, is a sacred
epitome of the Buddhists of this country. From
the 9th century it was worshipped by the Muslims
based on the belief that it is the Adam’s Peak. It
has been recorded that in 850 A.D. a merchant
and a traveller called ‘Sulaiman’ had arrived to
worship Sri Pada. None of them were disturbed
by the government or the citizens. Therefore, Sri
Pada is venerated by all four religions.
In the ancient time, the rulers and the citizens of
this country often thought how they could work
with all with co-existence for the betterment of
the country. Every occasion when the protection
of the stability of Buddhism and the unity of the
country were not threatened, that co-existence
was well preserved. We should always remember
that the way the Sinhala Buddhist people, who
lived in this country, acted to tolerate other
nationals and religions is exemplary.

Important Facts
The ruling affairs in ancient Sri Lanka were
done by three institutions namely executive,
legislature, and judiciary. The king and the
public officers acted on behalf of the king
belonged to the executive. The king’s court made
decisions through discussions.
 Our ancient rulers always followed a flexible
foreign policy.
 There lived people who were engaged in
different professions in our ancient society. All
of them made a great contribution to the society
to make it more efficient and make the people’s
lives easier through that.
 From ancient time agriculture and animal
husbandry was the main livelihood of the
majority of people in this country.
 Ancient Sri Lankans had a high level of
aesthetic and literary appreciation. There are
evidences to prove that their creative ability and
talents were at a high level.
 Buddhism in this country in ancient time
was a profound philosophy and also it included
various activities which reflected people’s faith
and piety. There was a mutual, intimate and
respectable relationship with the Buddhist
monks and people.
 Apart
from Buddhism, other religious
thoughts too spread in the society in this country
from time to time. Based on the facts such as Sri
Lanka was an island and participated actively
in the trade affairs in the Indian Ocean, other
religious thoughts spread in this country.
 Living mutually with other ethnic groups
belonging to other cultures was a special
characteristic in the history of our country.
Padhanaghara – These were ancient buildings used by
the Buddhist monks to be engaged in deep meditations.
The Padhanagharas were built by connecting two
buildings, with a moat around it, with a small bridge.
The Perimiyamkulam
inscription, made by king
Vasabha, mentions a Padhanaghara named Sudassana.
Such Padhanagharas can be seen in places like
Ritigala, Manakanda, and Anuradhapura. The word
“Dvithwa Vedika Godanegily (Bi-platform buildings)”
is also used to name ‘Padhanaghara’.
Poogaya – The meaning of the Sanskrit word ‘Pooga’
is a council or a panel consisting of some people. The
word ‘Pooga’ has been written in ancient inscriptions
to introduce ‘the council of the merchants’. The word
‘Niyamasthana (Niyamathana)’ too has been used in
the inscriptions with the same meaning.
Cufic Arab Letters – The word ‘Cufic’ means the
original form of various Arab scripts. That script style
got developed centering the Kuffa city in Iraq in the
seventh century A.D. Cufic letters were used to copy the
sacred Quran which is the religious text of the Muslim
devotees. Several tombstones written with these scripts
have been discovered in Sri Lanka too.
5 The Ancient Science and Technology in
Sri Lanka
Introduction
Science is understanding and interpreting the
elements that affect the function of the nature.
It is a process based on experience. Though
it was not discussed in the sense of science,
many ancient societies had realized the
fundamentals of nature and used them in their
day-to-day activities. Even in the historical
society of Sri Lanka, scientific ideas were in
use. In this lesson, we expect to explain the
nature of such ideas and the way that they were
used practically and to emphasize the scientific
nature of our historical heritage through them.
5.1 Early Stages of Scientific Ideas
By identifying what Sri Lankans did from ancient
time, we can realize the nature of the vision, which
was the background of those work. When some
of such activities are examined carefully, it is clear
that some of such things had been done thinking
scientifically. When working with nature, being
knowledgeable on its fundamentals, is necessary.
The success of the activities from making a
tomb to constructing huge irrigation systems
depends on understanding fundamentals of the
nature correctly, which is needed to keep them
for a longtime. In this chapter we will discuss
the scientific ideas that existed in Sri Lanka and
the nature of the technical approaches which
were followed to put those scientific ideas into
practice.
We have seen that when something is thrown
up, it falls down. It is a characteristic of the
nature. There is a fundamental which affects
that characteristic. Scientists introduce it as
gravitation. Scientists have proved through
experiments that everything is attracted in a
certain space limit on earth. If someone wants
to find its truth, he or she can experiment and
substantiate it. That is the nature of science.
The normal order, which is followed in doing
is understanding
something
the fundamentals
in nature correctly and
substantiating
them by examining. After
examining, what needs to work practically, using
the fundamentals of the nature, is technology.
It is a fundamental in physics that the different
types of energies in nature cannot be destroyed,
but they can be transformed to other energies.
Accordingly, transforming electric power into
kinetic power and making an electric fan is a
technical substitute.
scientifically,
Some of the instances, which reflect how the
ancient Sri Lankans had acted to apply the
fundamentals of nature after having understood
them, belonged to the prehistoric era. 28000
years ago symmetrical stone tools were made
up of alabaster named ‘ground-glass’. Those
symmetrical stone tools reflect the then prevailed
organized technology to shape up those hard
stone. This technology with which tools are
made after removing stone splinters by using
much power is called pressure slating.
The early stages of applied science were reflected
in the prehistoric age and it became matured in
the proto-historic age that came next. Given be-
low are some instances which describe the na-
ture of the scientific ideas that prevailed during
that age.
Clay Tub Burials
Clay Tub burials were made to cremate the
dead people. They were made up in the shape
of a huge basin or a boat using raw clay. After
selecting the appropriate clay type, the walls of
the tomb were built with a minimum height
and a suitable thickness. They had thought of
keeping the balance of the walls of the tomb by
building them perpendicular to the ground. Not
only in the tomb, but also the walls of the house,
found in Udaranchamadama, have been built
perpendicularly.
It’s a fundamental of physics that when any
object is perpendicular to earth in that manner,
the pressure of those objects created on earth is
neutralized. Those who built them had thought
to minimize the harm to the walls by building
them so. You may have seen that even today the
masons use a plummet in building walls.
Though the burials, made up of raw clay, were
not dried and burnt, when the skeleton was
cremated, it had burnt well.
When the skeletons in a tomb, which belonged
to 1350 B.C, were cremated, a clay tube had been
fixed in order to get air inside it. It was in a recent
time about the 18th century that the modern
science propositioned that oxygen is essential
for the process of burning. But the people of this
country had understood that fundamental three
thousand and two hundred fifty years ago. (More
information on this regard has been explained in
the lesson ‘Settlements’.)
The Technology of Building Houses
Though the archaeologists assume that the
prehistoric people who lived in clear areas such
as Bellanbendipelassa had lived in a kind of huts,
no evidence has been discovered regarding that.
It is found that the prehistoric man had shown his
ability in arranging the place, where he wanted
to live, appropriately. This is displayed by parts
of a stone parapet discovered in the excavation of
Kithulgala Belilena. The archaeologists assume
that it must have been used to hold a cover made
of leaves of trees.
Clear evidences of building houses in Sri
Lanka could be found in the proto-historic
era. Archaeologists managed to discover ruins
of such a house built in 1129 B.C. That house
is in the village called Udaranchamadama in
Rathnapura district. Its floor has been made
up of reinforcing it by strewing strong pieces of
stone and applying clay on it. Its wall had been
made of clay and wattle. This was revealed by
discovering some burnt pieces of the wall. There
was a wall in the middle of the house to separate
it as the front part and the rear part of the house.
The holes of its wooden doorframe were found
in excavations. For building a house with a roof
on a foundation in this way needs technological
knowledge.
Making Earthenware (Clay pots)
Our country practised the technology of making
earthenware (pottery) from ancient time. Clear
evidence in this regard can be seen in the proto-
historic era. During those days a simple machine
called ‘Sakaporuwa’ (potter’s wheel) was used to
make clay pots. ‘Sakaporuwa’ (potter’s wheel)
is a round board which can be rotated. If the
earthenware needs to be made with a good
finishing, the clay should be seasoned and
prepared well. It needs a good knowledge of
several steps such as finding the suitable type
of clay, seasoning them, making a stove to burn
them and burning the raw earthenware at an
appropriate temperature. Some clay pots, which
belonged to the proto-historic era, had been
found. Their interior is in black colour and the
exterior is in red colour. The term ‘Kaalaraktha
Varna Meti Bandun’ (black-red colour clay pots)
is used to name them. Before the clay pot is burnt,
it is filled with chaff and kept upside down in the
stove. Afterwards, when it is burnt in the stove,
it gets red colour outside and black inside. Inside
of it turns dark because it does not get enough
oxygen to be burnt since it is filled with chaff. This
technology of burning clay pots disappeared after
300 B.C. In addition, there was the technology
of polishing and colouring the outside of the
clay pot after it was burnt. The best example for
this is the coloured clay pot discovered in the
ancient house in Udaranchamadama. It had a
white background with lines painted in orange
colour. The natural red colour brown stones had
been used to colour them. Before this clay pot
was made, clay was dissolved in water and kept
until the tiny particles were deposited. Next, very
clean clay particles, as alluvial was used to make
this clay pot. This method is very similar to the
one used at present day to make porcelain ware.
Since our people used earthenware abundantly in
ancient time, the technology, which was needed
to make them in a standard way, advanced from
the proto-historic era.
Activity 1
Prepare an article for a newspaper on the title
scientific knowledge and the technical skills of
our ancestors referring to the lesson "the early
stages of Applied Science."
5.2 The Maturity of Scientific Usage
5.2.1 Water Management
Since the oldest settlements in our country had
distributed in the dry zone, the major challenge
that those people had to face was collecting
sufficient water for agricultural activities and
their day-to-day needs. The need of constructing
tanks, ponds and canals arose on this ground.
The term ‘water management’ is the most suitable
one to name any strategy used to gather water.
We can understand the nature of the marvellous
knowledge of our scientists and engineers who
lived in the ancient time by looking at activities
that they have done for water management.
Constructing large tanks – One of the great
successful,
controlling
activities in our historical age was making
large tanks. These large tanks were built based
on multiple-facts such as making agricultural
floods,
activities
and meeting the needs of the urban people.
Constructing large scale tanks is a technical
attempt with a very complex scientific knowledge.
Some names of the large scale tanks constructed
during the Anuradhapura era have been given
below. After understanding their magnitude,
you will easily realize the fact that how much of
scientific knowledge is needed to construct and
maintain such tanks after they are filled with
water.
Kawdulla Tank
Minneriya Tank
Hurulu Wewa
Kala Wewa
Padaviya Tank
(2537 hectares)
(2550 hectares)
(2125 hectares)
(2125 hectares)
(2357 hectares)
Major factors that should be paid attention in
constructing such large scale tanks are keeping
the gathered water for a long time by controlling
the pressure caused by its colossal capacity of
gathered water and controlling the power caused
by its extremely destructive pressure when the
water is taken out for use.
Tank bund – It is essential to construct the tank
bund strongly if it needs to hold a huge water
capacity in it. When such a thing is practically
done, what is important is taking steps needed
to prevent the tank bund from sinking when
it is constructed. What our ancient engineers
had followed for this is that constructing the
tank bund on a naturally established rock. After
finding such a rock located between two natural
hills, the tank bund was built connecting the hills
from either side. As the tank bund is connected
to two natural hills, it provided some assistance
to the strength of the tank bund. The bund of
the ‘Yodha Wewa’ is about seven miles in length
Fig. 5.1 In the place where foreign engineers recommended to construct the sluice gate of the present day Maduru Oya
dam, a sluice gate which had been built hundreds years ago, was discovered. These are the ruins of that sluice gate.
and its height is 44 feet. You can understand how
strong an artificially built soil bund should be, if
it is to hold the pressure caused by its magnitude
of water after the tank is filled.
The robustness is essential if the stability of the
tank bund needs to be protected. To maintain
this situation a systematic methodology has
been applied when the tank bund was built. To
understand this technology the archaeologists
examined the tank bund of Sigiri Mahawewa tank
by excavating it. What was seen here was that the
tank bund had been constructed of several soil
layers. It had been made of several thoroughly
beaten layers such as, a layer of clay, soil, gravel
and clay (Kirimeti) layer, kept one on one. Even
today you may have seen soil layers being beaten
in constructing roads to prevent them from
sinking. Though today we have machines to do
those things, in ancient time animals may have
been used to do so. The historical sources say
that elephants were used to beat soil layers in
constructing the foundation of the Ruwanweli
Seya.
Ralapanawa – When a tank is filled with water,
waves occur on its surface. It happens so because
of the wind and motion of the water. The structure
that is built to prevent the harm of eroding the
tank bund due to the power caused by water
waves is known as Ralapanawa. The Ralapanawa
is made by keeping stones on the interior slope
of the tank bund. Realizing the power caused by
water waves and using a method to prevent it was
a result of the scientific thought of our ancestors.
Sluice- Releasing water from tanks in which
magnitude of water contains, is a task that should
be done carefully. In parallel to the distribution
of water filled area in a tank, the height of its
bund, which is holding water, also increases.
Then, the height of the water level also increases.
An extreme pressure is created due to the height
of water. When releasing water out of such a
place, one has to be highly careful because there
is a possibility of turning it to be disastrous every
time.
It seems that the engineers who lived in our
country in the ancient time had thought of this
well. The structure that they built to take water
out of the large scale tanks is known as ‘Sorowwa’
(sluice). The sluice was built at a specific level on
the tank bund using huge pieces of stones. In the
Wessagiriya inscription made by king Mahinda
IV, the two words ‘Mohol Naga’ could be seen.
It says that ‘having set the stick which controls
the water in the sluice’. The sluice was built using
pieces of stones in a way in which it began from
the area where water is filled in the tank bund
and going under the tank bund or piercing it. A
slab of stone, connected to the sluice vertically,
was used to release water. Water was released by
moving it. These slabs were known as ‘Diyaketa
Pahana’. In the Wessagiri inscription there is
a reference as “ Sathar Riyanak Diyat Hindavu
Diya Keta Pahan’’. It means that a stone slab,
which was connected to a sluice to control water,
was of a four Riyans (a unit of measurement )in
height.
Bisokotuwa (sluice gate) - Bisokotuwa (sluice
gate) is also a one part of the sluice. It means the
rectangular space made of stones, from which
water flows out from the tank. When it is looked
from above, it looks like a square. There are
more than one sluice made in tanks with a high
bund. Its purpose is to take water out with least
pressure level after releasing water at different
pressure levels. The mud sluice is at the bottom
level of a tank bund. This structure called the
mud sluice was used to remove alluvial collected
after a rainy season.
To build a sluice and to utilize it, a scientific
knowledge is essential. Specially, what related to
it is the understanding of the behaviour of the
water well. That characteristic is known as the
‘clearness of water’. That is why it is important to
learn about sluices under the title of ‘the ancient
science of our country’.
Canals – Making anicuts across rivers, gathering
water and taking the gathered water to tanks
was a technicality, related to water management,
which prevailed in our country from ancient
time. There is a reference about an officer named
‘Adika’ in an inscription which belongs to the 2nd
century B.C. He was a one who engaged himself
in constructing canals.
Constructing Elahera Ela barricading the Amban
River, which was a tributary of the Mahaweli
River, was a huge canal built in ancient time.
Water was carried through this to the tanks such
as Minneriya, Giritale, Kawudulla and Kantale.
There was another canal built barricading the
Mahaveli River in Minipe area to carry water up
to Polonnaruwa.
Another section related to the water management
in our country in ancient time was the ponds
dug and made for the use of monks who stayed
in temples and monasteries. Kuttam Pokuna,
Kumara Pokuna, Eth Pokuna and Nelum Pokuna
were examples for this.
There used to be a technology in our country
from ancient time to keep the standard and
coolness of water in personal using. Specially,
there is brackish water in the dry zones such
as Anuradhapura. Therefore, it is natural for
someone to invent techniques to protect the due
standard of water. A major procedure is that
they followed a systematic method in digging
wells for drinking water. Large sized clay pots
were put into the well and covered the walls of
the well with them. These wells are known as
‘Uraketa Lin’. Such ‘Uraketa Lin’ (wells) have
been discovered in several places in the dry zone.
Water Fountains in Sigiriya -The fountains
which can be seen in the Western park of Sigiriya
are one of the greatest creations. Four fountains
have been created on either side of the entrance-
avenues that stretch across the Western water
park, towards the Sigiriya rock. The reason
for creating four fountains was the need of
making a certain change in the water- stream
level which goes up out of them. The method
in which these fountains have been made is
simple as well as efficient. The basic theory
followed there is lifting water abruptly, which
pours down from an approximate height of 600
feet through a system of gutters to the flat land,
by using pressure. By fixing a splinter of stone
with round shaped holes in the place where the
pressure is created, the water is thrown up in a
beautiful way. The method that has been used to
change the height of the water stream due to the
water pressure generated naturally is to change
the diameter of the holes in the stone splinter,
which has been fixed to the place where pressure
is created. The water stream goes up more due to
the high pressure created by the hole with a small
diameter and the water stream goes up only a
little as comparatively a lesser pressure is given
by the hole with a bigger diameter. The system
of gutters in the Sigiriya water park have been
made spirally in a way which makes water flow
for a long distance in a low slope by allowing
the alluvial, which mixes with water when water
flows down from the top of the Sigiriya rock, to
sink down with the help of natural gravitation
power. Stone splinters have been kept in several
places in the gutters to remove the alluvial which
gathers in the rainy season. When heavy rains
fall in Sigiriya, one can see water fountains work
automatically even today.
5.2.2 Architecture
Many details of the ancient architecture are
found when the ruins in Anuradhapura and
Polonnaruwa kingdoms are examined. That
displays to us how different artisans in the ancient
time had made great architectural creations. You
will study some of the best architectural creations
here.
as Buddhist
Architecture – Many architectural creations
constructions, Stupas,
Bodhigharas, Pilimageval, shrines, monasteries,
alms halls, meditating cells, palaces, fortresses,
and hospitals found from Anuradhapura and
Polonnaruwa eras could be seen.
Ruwanweli Seya and the other Stupas, built in
Anuradhapura in the North Central dry zone in
Sri Lanka which gets heavy monsoon rains, may
be vulnerable to lightning strikes at any time. But,
there are neither historical nor archaeological
evidences to prove that they were struck by
lightning. The reason for this is that the ancient
engineers had acted to provide the scientific
application to those buildings to protect them
from such accidents. It is taught in physics that
lightning occurs when static electricity passes
between clouds containing two contradictory
electric charges. Such extremely powerful
current comes to the earth through a tall object
with electric conduction. When the electricity
passes in that manner, the object is destroyed
by burning. You will learn more details of this
process in your science lesson.
At present even some houses have lightning
conductor to get protection from lightning.
When Ruwanweli Seya was built, the engineers,
who built it, did not forget to fix a lightning
conductor. In historical sources that tool is
introduced in the name of ‘Vajra chumbata,.
‘Vajra’ is the lightning which is an electric current
generated naturally. The word ‘Chumbata’ has
derived from the word ‘chumbaka’ (magnetic).
Its meaning is ‘Kandama’. In Sinhalese language
‘Kandama’ means ‘attract’ or ‘cling’. Therefore,
using the word ‘Vajra chumbata’ to name the
structure made at the top of Ruwanweli Seya to
attract lightning is appropriate. The electricity
created by lightning is known as ‘static electricity’.
It is taught in physics.
The Foundation of Ruwanweli Seya
Those evidences show us that there were
buildings from the ancient time in this country.
Very advanced scientific knowledge and a
training on technology would need to put that
scientific knowledge into practice in constructing
the buildings found in Anuradhapura such as
Jethvanaramaya, Abhayagiriya, Ruwanweli Seya,
and several storeyed Lovamahapaya. For example
Ruwanweli Seya was constructed by king
Dutugemunu. It was the biggest Stupa constructed
by that time. An adequately long description on
an ancient construction has only been written
about Ruwanweli Seya. Specially, a vivid and a
descriptive explanation has been given in the
historical sources about how the foundation of
this great Stupa was made. According to it, first
Fig. 5.2. There was a road system stretching from Anuradhapura at that time. The road engineers of that time built bridges
out of granites to cross the Malvathu Oya flowing across Anuradhapura. It clearly shows that they had known the basic
scientific theory of constructing bridges. These are the present ruins of a stone bridge built so.
the earth of the place, where the Stupa was due to
be built, had been dug in seven Riyanas (cubits)
deep. Secondly, using strong men lime stones
were brought, put them into the pit, broken them
into pieces, poured water and trampled them
well using tuskers wearing shoes made of animal
skin. Thirdly, a type of clay named Wendaru
was laid among those stones to reinforce them.
Fourthly, another layer of stones and a layer of
gravel were laid on it respectively. A layer of
crystal was laid on the gravel layer. A type of clay
named ' Navaneetha’ was smeared on that stone
layer. Next, an iron net smeared with wood apple
gum dissolved with a chemical fluid was laid
upon it. Finally, the stones named ‘Ransiriyal’
soaked with sesame oil were laid upon it.
When we pay our attention to this description,
we can understand that the foundation of
Ruwanweli Seya has been made according
to a similar method of the modern concrete
technology. Such kind of strong base has been
laid because it is a must that the heaviness of the
mammoth stupa made of bricks is sustained for
a long time without any damage. This example
clearly reflects the way that our engineers thought
and acted in making a huge construction and
the scientific thought relevant to it two thousand
and two hundred years ago.
Urban Park Designing
There was
advanced knowledge of
constructing buildings and designing parks in
our ancient society. The best example that can
be given for this is the city plan of Sigiriya and
its park complex. Sigiriya is a great city centre
which was built in the 5th century A.D. It has
been built centreing a huge rock which stands
alone. The Sigiriya rock is 200 metres in height
from its surrounding valley. The extent of the
top of the rock, on which ruins of a palace
Fig. 5.3. The technology of melting iron has been mastered by the artisans of our country from ancient time. Archaeologists
have discovered a number of furnaces which were used to melt iron. The figure on left shows such a ruined and old iron
furnace, discovered in the Samanala Wewa area which belongs to the Sabaragamuwa province. It was operated with the
help of natural wind power. The figure on the right shows such a new furnace made by the archaeologists (rights of the
photograph belongs to Julian Julef).
could be seen, is approximately three hectares.
The eastern and western royal accesses located
focusing on the rock are of 40 hectares and 90
hectares respectively. The brick walls which
have been constructed around the city complex
for its security is approximately 10 kilometres.
Apart from this, the entire length of the moats
made around the Sigiriya rock is 8 kilometres.
All of these things have been built according to a
properly planned mathematical structure.
Hygiene and Medicinal Method
Sri Lanka has a considerable history of
medicine. Mahawamsa mentions the maternity
houses (Sivikasala) which had been built in
Anuradhapura during the ruling period of king
Pandukabhaya. The Wamsakatha mention that
king Dutugemunu had built eighteen hospitals.
We earlier mentioned the details mentioned in
the inscriptions about doctors who worked in
those hospitals in this book.
Some ancient rulers of our country had mastered
the medicine. Or else they extended their fullest
support to widen the practice of medicine. In
1982 the archaeologists were able to find some
significant evidences regarding this. They were
found when the ancient land, called Alahana
Pirivena situated in Polonnaruwa, with ruins,
was excavated. In that place ruins of an ancient
hospital emerged.
There was a hospital building of 147.5 feet in
width and 109.2 feet in length. The instruments
which were used for complex surgeries too
were there among the things discovered from
the place. Those relics show us that our ancient
indigenous medicine was much advanced.
Apart from this, information has been discovered
on medicinal texts, herbal boats, allocating lands
for indigenous doctors, growing herbal gardens.
We can understand that ancient people had
acquired a good understanding about waste
management from the remaining ruins of
lavatories.
The lavatory systems used in the palaces were
prepared to send the waste to a very deep pit. It
seems that they had acted to emit the waste in a
manner in which no any harm was done to the
environment. A gutter for unclean water too has
been discovered from the ruins in Polonnaruwa.
Special tubes were fixed in bathing ponds to
pump the polluted water out. Mahawamsa
mentions that there were seven lavatories built
in comparison to the buildings at the Alahana
monastery (Pirivena). Accordingly, it is clear
that in designing ancient buildings, the hygiene
of their users had been paid much attention to.
Samanala Wewa area in Balangoda
in the Sabaragamuwa province. The
second one is the ancient iron furnaces
the Alakolawewa,
discovered
Dehigaha Elakanda
close
to Sigiriya which belongs to the
Central province. The natural stones
abundant with iron have to be heated
much to leach iron from them. Iron
melts at 1538 degree Celsius. There
should be an efficient technology to
get an excessive-temperature. Iron
leaching in Samanala Wewa has
been done in third century B.C. The
natural wind power has been used to
inflame the furnaces used for melting.
The furnaces built in a mountain-
face would flame for nearly about 12
hours without extinguishing with the
help of the wind blowing between the
hills. Even today during the monsoon
time the wind, which blows across
that area in the evening, continues
until the dawn of next day. The
natural stones with iron that were
put into the furnaces after breaking
them into pieces would be inflamed
by placing cinders on them with the
help of the natural wind power in
the evening which would blow until
the following dawn. By the following
morning iron would be leached from
the stones. The stones, which were
used in Samanala Wewa to leach
iron, are the types introduced in the
Plan 5.1 The foundation plan of the Alahana Pirivena in Polonnaruwa. This
hospital was used from the time of King Parakramabahu I.
The Ancient Iron Leaching Technology
From very ancient time our ancestors knew the
iron leaching technology well. The archaeologists
were able to discover a piece of iron- slag from a
tomb dated in 2400 B.C. in Beragala in the Uva
province. It is a piece of evidence which reflects
that the iron was melted in those days.
There are
instances which assist us
to understand the nature of iron leaching
technology in Sri Lanka. The first one among
them is the iron melting furnaces found in the
terms ‘Limonite’ and ‘Hematite’ in chemistry. To
inflame those furnaces, they had used the cinders
taken by burning the trees called ‘Maran’. Even
now these trees can be seen in this province. The
term ‘Yakada Maran’ too is used to name these
trees.
The wind power to inflame the furnaces in
Dehigahaelakanda area has been provided with
the help of bellows. From 180 B.C. to 200 A.D.
iron leaching had been done there.
or several lamps with a certain oil (Mee
or Sesame). This method was followed
by our ancient people to prevent the
threat of insects to their crops or to
cure some diseases infected to cattle.
In 2009 the archaeologists managed
to find significant information about
the Poojas performed for gods in the
ancient time. They discovered some
ruins of an ancient Devala in the
excavations carried out in the area
named Galpaya in Rathnapura district.
Clay pots were kept upside down in a
circle of about 6 feet diameter. There
were marks of a fire of its inside space.
There were a clay water pot and a jaw of
an ox. The archaeologists were able to find holes
of posts which belonged to a hut which had been
built to cover everything. In later analysis, it was
revealed that the place had been used to perform
‘Kirimadu Shantikarmaya’. It is performed for
cattle’s protection. According to scientific dating,
that Devala had belonged to third century A.D.
Performing the ‘Kirimadu Shantikarmaya’ for
the protection of cattle is done even today in the
provinces of Uva and Sabaragamuwa.
5.2.4. Indigenous Knowledge
- There was
Measure and Calculation
knowledge, in our ancient society, relevant to
the fundamentals that existed in the nature by
understanding them from such an old time. One
indicator which shows that there exists scientific
knowledge in a certain society is that there is a
methodology to measure the physical situations
which belong to the nature. Our ancient
measurements can be introduced as examples
for them.
Measuring the space - Our ancient people needed
to measure the space when they used land for
farming. Therefore, suitable measurements for
that were prepared with the help of farming.
Fig. 5.4. A few pairs of metal scissors, found in excavations, among the
ruins of the hospital buildings in Alahana Pirivena in Polonnaruwa. These
were used for hospital surgeries.
Minor Industries – Apart from this, making
various jewellery, clay industry, gem industry and
forging industry were under minor industries.
The golden jewellery found in the excavations in
Jethawanaya can be taken as the best example for
the technology of making various jewellery. It is a
part of a pendant as small as a paddy seed. There
had been 21 flowery carvings on it. It may be a
challenge to the modern goldsmith. And also, the
coloured roof tiles discovered in Abhayagiriya
excavations reflect the advancement of the
ancient clay industry in this country.
When we examined the instruments such as
various types of arms and defense items found
so far, it seems that there was a vast advancement
in the forging industry.
5.2.3. Local Rituals
too. Performing Poojas
Though Buddhism was famous among people,
at the time, they tended to do other practices
(Yathukarma)
various provincial gods was prominent among
them. Apart from this, a simple practice called
“Kempahan” was performed to solve day- to-day
problems. What they do normally here is that
performing a Pooja by lighting one votive lamp
Illustration 5.1. A drawing made by an artist to show the way the ancient Devalaya, which was found in Galpaya, must have
existed at its early stages.
They used the measurements such as, Kiriya,
Amuna, Karisaya, Pela. A field of one Karisa
means a place where one Karisa of paddy can
be sown. One Karisa is equal to four Amunas.
One Amuna is equal to two acres field. Having
a multiple link in measurements in this way is
an advanced mathematical feature. The fact
that should be taken into consideration here is
that to measure the space the ancient people of
this country had used units which are used to
measure the volume. Look at the cycle given
below.

There is a description of a land which has
a reference that one Karisa was offered to a
Stupa built in that area, in an inscription, got
written by king Bathikabhaya, found in a place
called Dunumadalakanda in the Anuradhapura
district. An inscription, which was established
by King Kootatakannabhaya, found in the area
named Horiwila in Anuradhapura, says that
a plot of land of eight Karisa was offered to a
temple named Tissa in that area.
There was a methodical system of measurements
to measure the length in the ancient time. The
smallest one of that was the atom. It was a small
one. To measure short distances, there were
measurements such as Angulaya and Viyatha. A
Measuring the weight
There were methodical units to
measure the weight too. Specially,
in trade affairs measuring the
weight of some commodities was
needed. According to the pillar
inscription of Soraborawewa, it
was prohibited to use weights,
scales
and measuring units
which were not approved by the
government. Try to understand
the nature of the measuring
system used in the ancient time
by reading the cycle given below.

We are well aware of the fact that we need digits
to mark the measurements. Present day we use
digits introduced by the Arabs.
Therefore, they are called Arab numbers. But
there was an old digit system in our country. The
numbers ranged from one to ten can be seen in
ancient inscriptions. The way they were written
has been given in the chart 5.1.
Measuring Time
Measuring time is very important for a society
based on agriculture. Sowing seeds and reaping
the harvest should be done according to the
correct time. The sources provide us sufficient
evidence to understand the methods used to
measure time by our ancient people. The term
‘Varshaya’ was used to measure a long time period.
It was based on a method of months according
to the lunar cycle. Thirty days time, fifteen days
from new-moon day to the full-moon day and
another fifteen days from the full-moon day to
new-moon day, was considered a month. These

Pallebadde Galpaya in Sabaragamuwa province. This was buried in four feet
deep from the ground level. The place, has been identified as a place where
‘Kirimadu Yagaya’ was performed. This belonged to the second century A.D.
Viyatha consists of 9 inches. Small measurements
were essential in constructing buildings and
making statues. The measurements like Gawwa,
Yoduna and Usaba were used to measure long
distances. King Nissankamalla ordered to erect
posts to mark every distance of Gawwa. It is very
similar to present day Kilometer posts. Those
stone posts were named as Gawuthakanu. Two
of such Gawuthakanu posts have been discovered
in areas named Katugahagalge and Weligaththa
in the Southern province. It seems that this
measuring system had been used commonly in
ancient eastern countries. Try to understand its
mathematics by reading the cycle given below.

‘Mohotha (moment)’ has derived from
the term ‘Muhurtha’.
Scientific thoughts are needed in using
measurements and numbers. We can
understand
that our ancestors had
thought scientifically to understand the
complex elements in the world. Several
scientific experiences of Sri Lankans,
who lived in the ancient time, have been
explained in this lesson by means of such
mathematical concepts.
Dedigama Elephant Lamp (Eth Pahana)
The place Punkagama, where king
Parakramabahu I (1153 -1186 A.D) was
born, is presently known as Dedigama.
It is in Kegalle district. A stupa has
been built in memory of his birth. It is
known as Dedigama Suthighara Stupa.
In 1951 this Stupa was excavated by the
archaeologists. They were able to find a
bronze lamp from the Stupa. This lamp
consists of two human figures sitting on
a tusker. The tusker is holding a sugar
cane in its trunk. The special feature
of this lamp is that it has been made to pour
the oil into the abdomen of the tusker. It is the
storehouse of oil. The oil trickles to the lamp
through the genital organ of the tusker. When
the oil level of the lamp dwindles by burning,
spontaneously the oil stored inside the abdomen
of the tusker trickles to the lamp. A scientific
theory has been followed here. It belongs to the
non-motile hydrology. Here, the oil regulation
occurs automatically. Dedigama Suthighara
bronze elephant oil lamp is an obvious example
to substantiate the knowledge that the ancient
Sri Lankan engineers had on fundamentals of
complex physics.

ancient inscriptions in Sri Lanka.
two parts were introduced as ‘Purapakshaya’ and
‘Awapakshaya’ respectively. The terms Duruthu,
Navam, Medin, were used to name the months
of thirty days time.
The eastern term ‘Vasa’ or ‘Havajara’ has been
used to name a time period of twelve months
in the inscriptions. The term ‘Vasa’ from the
Sanskrit word ‘Varsha’ and the term ‘Havajara’
from the Sanskrit word
‘Sanvasthara’ were
derived. The present term ‘Avurudu’ has derived
from the ancient term ‘Havajara’ (Havajara >
Havurudu > Avurudu). The term ‘Thithiya’
was used to mean a day. The word ‘Thatha’ has
been mentioned in an inscription, established

our villagers were invented by themselves to
solve their problems. It is another system of
knowledge.
Activity 2
1. Write an essay on the scientific knowledge
and technical skills of our ancestors.
2. Explain the instances which reflect the local
identity through science and technology used in
the proto-historic era.
Sigiriya Water Park – The ruins in the Western part of the
Sigiriya rock reflect its water park. This park has been built
according to a symmetrical plan. The things which can be seen
on one side can be seen on the other side as well in the park.
The part in its western end has been introduced in the name of
‘Kshudra Jala Udyanaya’, which means ‘minor water park’.
The reason why the entire Western part of Sigiriya Park is
named as Water Park is that the things such as ponds, water
ditches, and beautiful water fountains had been built there.
Kirimadu Yagaya – This is a performance of ‘Shantikarma’
done wishing for the security of cattle and success of
agricultural activities commonly. It is done primarily on an
indigenous god named ‘Mangara’. This is a practice common
to Sabargamuwa province.
Diyaketa Pahana – It was a stone post connected to the sluice
of ancient tanks. Water is released out by moving this stone
post. The inscriptions mention that several such stone posts
were connected to the sluices in some large scale tanks.
Fig. 5.6 This elephant lamp made of bronze was discov-
ered from Kotawehera, Dedigama in Kegalle District. The
oil in the lamp is filled into the stomach of the elephant
image. When the oil level decreases, the principle of stat-
ic hydrology has been used to refill oil. This shows the
knowledge possessed by ancient craftsmen about the
principles related to Physics.

Historical Knowledge and Its Practical Application
Introduction
Any society exists in a balanced manner
based on knowledge. This knowledge
formed related to the culture that is created
when he or she
lives according to the
natural environment which belongs to that
society. Therefore, in world spread societies,
knowledge systems, which are different from
each other, could be seen. All these knowledge
systems corroborate with the sustainable
existence and the production efficiency of
the society to which it belongs. There may
be diverse aspects to the structure about the
knowledge which is made up by a society. The
criteria which are necessary to organize one’s
society, beliefs and criteria for practical steps
which are necessary to formalize economic
exchanges are some of them. Such knowledge
structures produced by a historical society give
experiences even to a present day society. That
is known as the cultural heritage. This lesson
has been compiled with a view of forming
the basic foundation to create a citizen who
has a historical consciousness by generating
sensitivity in the student about six selected
concepts that belong to the historical cultural
heritage in Sri Lanka. These concepts comprise
of the ancient social organization in Sri Lanka,
law and tradition, finance and exchange,
protecting the environment, representation of
women, and local food.
6.1 Social Organization in the Historical Era
Social organization means the nature of the
relationships between the people and groups
of that society which helps to maintain the
sustainability of a particular society. It is
a sociological concept. Anything becomes
successful when it is organized. Society is no
exception. When the social organization is
unstable, its law, ethics and values get destroyed.
As a result, that society becomes disharmonious.
In the historical era, the intelligent and efficient
rulers who ruled our country, constantly
dedicated themselves to well organize the society
of our country. Having an order in personal
relationships is one of the major characteristics
in a social organization. It is called hierarchy.
There is a social hierarchy in a society. If it is a
hierarchy in which the power goes down from
up, it is called a vertical hierarchy. The order such
as king, ministers, government officers, arranged
in top down order is a good example for that.
There are also structures with similar power in
the society. In various institutions, the officers
are equal. Such a structure is called a horizontal
hierarchy. Ministers, army generals, treasurers are
similar in power. Study chart 6.1 to understand
the social organization which existed in ancient
Sri Lanka.
The king is at the top of this social hierarchy.
It was accepted that the king should be highly
virtuous and an heir to the throne from the
lineage. Therefore, the king was noble. We have
described in the third chapter that the word
‘Nara Isera’ had been inscribed in an inscription,
which belonged to king Kootakannatissa, in the
Dambulla temple to show that the king was an
“Eshwara” to the countrymen.
Those who worked close to the king were royal
officers. The term “Radkol Samdaru” had been
used to name such officers. Its meaning is “Raja
Herdsmen

professor Senaka Bandaranayake, published in 2013)
Kula Swami Daru”. The term “Radala” had been
derived from this word by the Kandyan kingdom.
(RajaKula > Radkol > Radol >Radala).
The Buddhist clergy was at a top position in
the social organization, as they advised the
government. Sometimes they participated in
the affairs of country ruling. The kings acted to
hand over the authority to the Buddhist temples
to collect taxes from the tanks in the 1st and 2nd
centuries A.D.
The rich merchants, naval captains, doctors, and
teachers were considered to be the chieftains
of the society from ancient time. None of them
participated in animal husbandry or farming.
The people of the country were below these
chieftains. The inscriptions call them as “Kudeen”.
There were farmers, shepherds, potters, gem
cutters, blacksmiths, fishermen and people
engaged in other work were among them. The
whole society depended on the food produced
by the farmers.
The relationship between the general public in
the country and the chieftains in top positions
existed through mediators such as traders and
government officers. The inscriptions mention
about the government officers who travelled in
the villages from time to time. On these journeys,
the villagers had informed their problems to
those officers who later informed those problems
Illustration 6.1 Sri Lankan kings got the things such as money given to the temples and information relevant to the law
written on rocks. It meant the long lasting feature of those writing.
to the government officers of higher ranks and
they informed them to the king.
Slaves were at the lowest level of the society. Their
duty was to be engaged in various activities. They
did not have the freedom, which was enjoyed
by the others in the society. There were two
types of slaves those days. One group of them
were slaves from lineage. They were named as
‘Anwayathadasa’. There were mercenary slaves
too those days. The term ‘Dhanankeethadasa’
was used to name them.
The king did the things which were needed to
maintain better relationships and protect the
welfare of each group in this social organization.
Our intelligent kings had known that a society
could be protected from disruption by protecting
the bonds between each and every institution.
At present the term social cohesion is used to
describe this concept. Therefore, they always
tried to rule the country righteously.
6.2 Law and Tradition
The common principles formed by a society are
very important to run a society. Those common
principles later become the law. The principles
which are formed by a society are of two types.
Some of them are systems of written laws. Other
social acceptances are traditional.
The law and tradition control the anti-social
behaviours of people for the benefit of the
society. To protect the goodness of the society
our intelligent rulers acted in accordance with
law and tradition from ancient time.
Our kings acted with good understanding to
make laws, implement those laws and to supervise
those laws when they are used practically. In the
9th century A.D this country was ruled by a royal
lineage which belonged to the dynasty called
‘Manawamma’. The inscriptions inscribed by
those kings, mention about law institutions of
that time. In those inscriptions the two words
‘Wadala’ and ‘Sabhawa’ are found. In legal
activities officers from Wadala and Sabhawa
engaged in them. Here the word ‘Wadala’ means
the 'legislature', which is the parliament. In
ancient time it was the king’s court.
In those inscriptions the word ‘Sabhawa’ means
the ‘judiciary’. The laws imposed in a country are
implemented by the judiciary. Other inscriptions
corroborate that there was a methodical judicial
system in our country in the ancient time.
The laws are monitored among the people by
the security officers. They implement the powers
of the executive. The term ‘Mekapper’ has been
used in the inscriptions of the 9th century to
introduce such officers. It had derived from the
Tamil word ‘Mayikappar’. Its meaning is ''security
officer''. The term ‘Dandanayaka’ too was used
to name such officers. The Panakaduwa copper
plate, which was made during the time of king
Vijayabahu I, mentions that one ‘Dandanayaka’
named Sithnarubima Buddhanayake who had
provided protection to king Vijayabahu I during
the time when the king had adversities from
enemies.
The evidence, which assists us to know about
the nature of the laws that belonged to the most
ancient history of our country, is rare. However,
at least the ancient inscriptions help us to have
a certain understanding of them. Among them
the inscriptions of this country, which belonged
to the 1st and 2nd centuries A.D., mention the
laws regarding the irrigation, administration
and charging taxes for using lands of the state.
One sixth of the production had to be paid to the
government as tax.
Main types of taxes charged under the tax law:
• Dakapathi (Sanskrit: Udakaprapthi) – the tax
paid for using tank water.
• Bojakapathi (Sanskrit: Bhojakaprapthi) – the
tax paid for cultivating the lands of the king.
• Mataramajibaka
(Sanskrit: Mathrikamathsyabaga) – the tax paid
for catching fish in water courses.
At times the government charged commodities
as taxes. An inscription, which belonged to the
9th century, mentions that one nut out of ten of
the harvest should be paid to the government as
Apart from agricultural activities, the tax law
was relevant to several other sections. When
the commodities were imported from foreign
countries, custom fees were charged at the
harbour. An inscription, which belonged to the
1st century A.D., found at an ancient Buddhist
temple
in the Hambanthota
district, mentions that a custom fee charged by
a fort which was situated close to the temple was
offered to the temple.
in Godawaya
There was a judicial system to administer
punishments not only to those who violated the
tax laws imposed in this manner but also to those
who breached other laws imposed for securing
the social justice. An inscription made by king
Gajabahu I, in Situlpawwa, mentions about such
a high court. The inscription describes that the
fines charged by the Great Hall of Justice in the
area (Mahavinichahi Labanaka Watithi) were
offered to the monks in the Sithulpawwa temple
by the king for their provisions.
intelligent kings constantly acted
protect the natural quality of the environment.
Therefore, they were interested in imposing
laws which were necessary to protect animals,
vegetation, water and soil which belong to the
natural environment.

coins were brought to this country by Indian merchants.
inscription, which
The Kondawattawan
belonged to the 9th century A.D., mentions a law
of charging a fine of five Kalan from those who
did not plough their lands at the proper time.
This law was imposed because when a land is
ploughed in the rainy season, soil erosion occurs.
The rulers had imposed various types of laws
in order to protect the policies regarding
maintaining agricultural activities properly. A
law regarding this could be seen in an inscription
in Wessagiriya. It says that the grains, except
Sihineti paddy, green gram (Mun) should not
be sown in the paddy fields. This inscription
belonged to king Mahinda IV.
us to understand the nature of those laws that
existed in the 9th century A.D. in this country.
This is known as the Sorabora Wewa inscription.
It was made by king Udya III (946 -954 A.D.).
This inscription describes the laws which were
imposed by the king preventing some frauds
afoot in a government market situated in a
place called Hopitigamuwa. The king stepped
into the market while he was on his way to the
Mahiyanganaya temple. Given below are some of
the laws in the above mentioned inscription;
• Taxes should be charged from those who are
engaged in business in the Hopitigama trade area;
taxes should not be charged from the passers-by.
Trading was one of the important professions in
the ancient society. Our intelligent kings took

from those who do their business without

• Aricanuts and betel should only be sold by
Our kings were very strict regarding the criminal
keeping them in the huts made for them.
• An oil tax should be charged from those who
were engaged in trading during poya days.
By examining the rules and regulations in the
Sorabora Wewa inscription, we can understand
the nature of the civil laws which were relevant
to the internal trading of this country during the
time in which the above mentioned inscription
was made.
For the first time a law which said “no animal
should be killed” was
imposed by King
Amandagamini Abhaya (19-29 A.D.). It was
known as
‘Maghatha Law’. The Mihinthala
inscription , made by King Mihindu IV (956 -972
A.D), mentions that a law was imposed to give
the death sentence to those who kill buffalos, ox
and cows, and goats. King Nissankamalla (1187-
1196 A.D) imposed a law stating that the birds
living in reservoirs should not be killed.
law. The Wewalkaetiya inscription, made by
king Mihindu IV (956-972 A.D.), provides
us with descriptions on this. It describes the
punishments that should be given for the crimes
such as stealing and murders. Death sentence by
hanging is the punishment for murder. It further
says that when cattle thieves are caught, the cattle
should be given back to the owner and the seal
on the skin of the cattle should be marked on the
foreheads of the thieves with a heated iron. The
responsibility of catching the hiding criminals
were given to the villagers who lived in the same
villages in which the criminals too lived. The
villagers had to pay a tax to the government until
they caught the hiding criminals. It was known
as ‘Gruhadanda’.
Criminals were punished as an example to
the people of the society to emphasize that
they should not commit crimes. That was the
foundation of our law. At present Roman –Dutch
law is practised in Sri Lanka. It was introduced to

our country a long time later.
6.3 Finance and Exchange
Here, the exchange means the process of
interchanging with an economic purpose.
According to the information in the historical
sources, the barter system was used in economic
affairs in the most ancient era in this country.
The archaeologists believe that the circular shells
made of clay, discovered from archaeological
excavations, may have been used for exchange in
economic affairs.
The usage of coins in this country was started
in about 250 B.C. Those are a type of silver
coins brought to this country by the merchants
from the North India. The archaeologists name
produced in this country either in the last half
of the first century of B.C or in the first half
of the first century of A.D. The coin on which
the figures of an elephant and a Swastika were
engraved, which had been discovered from
archaeological excavations, is an example for
this. Afterwards, many kings had issued coins
during their ruling periods. There was a separate
officer performing the duty of moulding coins.
He was named as ‘Rupa Adyaksha (Picto-
director). This name appears in the inscriptions,
belonging to the 2nd century B.C., as ‘Rupadaka’.
Above mentioned (Fig. 6.2) is a picture of a coin
used in this country.
In the past, metal weight too was used as a value
in exchange activities in this country. A piece
of gold-metal was discovered in an excavation
at the Abhayagiri temple in Anuradhapura. On

or 9th century A.D. ‘Kalanda’ is a unit used to
measure weight. An inscription, discovered in

A.D., mentions that king Kashyapa IV (898 -914

Apart from the royal families, there was no
impediment for women in the general society to
possess leadership. In about the 2nd century B.C.
there were leaders by the name of ‘Parumaka’
who were related to the provincial ruling of this
country. An inscription, discovered at a place
called Brahmanayagama
in Anuradhapura
district, mentions a woman called Parumakalu
Buddhist monks, have been inscribed in those
caves. A rock inscription, found at the place
called Kokebe in Anuradhapura district, which
had belonged to the 2nd century A.D, mentions
a name of a woman as Thalatha Lakshmi. It
further mentions that she offered a half of her
family property to a Buddhist temple during
the time of king Bhathiytissa. The women who
lived then had the freedom to support religion
by spending their wealth.
Archaeological evidence discovered
in archaeological excavations are
necessary to substantiate the ideas
such as these found in literary
sources about the women who lived
in the ancient Sri Lanka. A metal
stick, which was used by a woman to
colour her eye lashes in the distant
history of 1129 B.C, was discovered
in an old house at a place named

and Atikesel which were consumed by the pre-
historic people who lived in the Beligala cave

In addition to different types of grain, various
kinds of yams had a significant place among
food in the ancient time. Old books mention

also eaten. The historical books of Sri Lanka
mention seven types of grain, which were used
as food by ancient people. They are namely Sali,
Veehi, Kedesa, Varaka, Kangu, Duma and Yawa.
There were Wetakolu, Thampala, Weraniya Dalu,
Kara Kola, Lunuwila Kola, Labu (pumpkin),

Various types of spices (Kulu Badu) were used to
make curries tasty in Sri Lanka in ancient time.
They were called ‘Katuka Bhanda’. Present day
women use the word ‘Thuna Paha (curry powder)’
instead of ‘Kulu Badu (spices)’ commonly. That
word means three special types and another
five types. The first three types mentioned are
Lunu (salt), Duru (dill) and Miris (chilly).
The other five are Sudu Duru (dill), Kalu Duru
(dill), Koththamalli (coriander), Aba (mustard)
and Uluhal. In some areas Asamodagam (dill
seeds) and Sathakuppa were used instead of Aba
(mustard)and Uluhal. Apart from this, various
types of sours were used to make food tasty. Dehi

‘Kenda (gruel)’ the three words ‘Ambu’, ‘Hambu’,

When rice was boiled with salt mixed water,
it was called ‘Diya Kenda’. The type of ‘Kenda’,
which was made by mixing one portion of rice
with six portions of water for patients, was called
‘Yawagu’. This was named as ‘Ulu Kenda’ as well.
Today we call it ‘Lunu Kenda’. Various types of
‘Kenda’ (gruel) were made mixing various types
of medicines for different kinds of illnesses.
Saddharmarathnawaliya mentions a kind of very
sweet gruel in the name of ‘Rasa Ulu Kenda’. It
was cooked in milk without water, using bee

6.6. Protecting the Environment
If the members in any society need to maintain
their society in a desirable manner they should
protect their environment. We have to face
numerous adversaries if the environment is
destroyed. There is the danger of getting shortage
of water due to cutting trees. Crops may be less
productive due to infertility of soil as a result
of soil erosion. All these bad results have to be
borne up by ourselves.
Our ancient rulers who were constantly conscious
of the importance of protecting the environment,
acted to impose laws on that. In the Anuradhapura
plate inscription, made by king Mihindu IV, an
order had been given forbidding clearing forests
on high lands. There is a possibility of eroding
soil and land slides due to clearing the forest on
high lands. On the other hand it is a direct cause
had been ordered to act according to the rules
and regulations imposed by the government in
managing trees and woods.
Rules and regulations regarding things such as
protecting wild animals and soil protection can
be seen in our ancient inscriptions. When we
review all these facts, it is obvious that we had an
organized procedure to protect the environment
in ancient time.
What you should realize from the facts that
we have discussed so far in this lesson, is that
respectable citizens had lived in our country
in the past. You should take as an example the
way they, who had been settling in this country
continuously for thousands years, applied their
knowledge which was gathered through their
life experiences and lived without being second
to any nation in the world.

 Our ancient society was systematically
organized. As it was formed in a way in which
the power went down from the top, it urged
each other in the society to perform their

‘Roopadaka’ to keep the standard of moulding
metal coins.
 There was a deep attention given to the respect
and the identity of women in the ancient Sri
Lankan society. Since she had many admirable
qualities, she was adored by the society. Our
ancient society had selected women to rule the
country too.
 Our ancestors were healthy enough to build
a great civilization because their food habits
were properly organized. That food, which had
a local flavour, can be used even today to spend
a healthy life style.
 Since our ancestors were farmers, they
maintained a good relationship with the natural
environment. Instead of destroying animals and
trees, there were even laws to deal with them in
an eco-friendly manner.

Urbanization – The word urbanization is used to name the
process in which a village transfers itself into a city. It is a
complex process. In comparison to a city, a village is a
small human settlement. A village is formed when a limited
community gathers into a small space. Family bonds based
on relationships are a major feature in a village. A city
is a human settlement, which consists of a considerably big
population. The people, who live in it, maintain their relations
based on their professions. A village turns to be a city when
the capitalists are generated due to increasing production of
the village. The predominant features in the settlements , where
wealthy people live, are engaging in local and foreign trade
affairs, mastery in craftsmanship, having a ruling structure
and using a script system.
Social Stratification – Social stratification simply means
the differences in any society according to their wealth.
Proletariats middle class, capitalist class are the stratas in a
society.
7 Decline of Ancient Cities in the Dry Zone and
Origin of New Kingdoms in South West
Introduction
The city of Anuradhapura which had belonged
to the North Central dry zone and the city of
Magama which had belonged to the Southern
dry zone continued to be wonderful cities for a
long time. The historical sources have described
the background of the origin of those cities.
For example Mahawamsa mentions that the
place which was called Anuradhagrama was
transformed as the city of Anuradhapura by
King Pandukabhaya. Historical sources provide
an accurate description of the development of
a previous village as a city. Certainly, a rural
settlement develops as a city.
The transformation of a rural settlement to an
urban settlement is a very long and a gradual
process. Certainly, what happens there is the
life style of the people transforms from a rural
form to an urban form. It happens as a result
of a long process. On one hand, the internal
economic development of the country affects
that process directly. On the other hand, trade
relations with foreign countries too affect that
process decisively. This lesson will describe the
origin of ancient cities and the decline of them.
7.1 Background of the Urban Life
The first urbanization in Sri Lanka is reflected
by Anuradhapura which belongs to the North
Central dry zone and ancient Magama city
which had belonged to Southern and South–
eastern part of Sri Lanka. There were basic signs
of development in these two cities by about 450
B.C. That does not mean by then the things such
as walls, moats, and streets, which were essen-
tials for a city, had been constructed. A popula-
tion with a life condition which is needed for a
city could be seen.
You learnt in the second lesson that there is
evidence, which goes back to 2400 B.C., that
reflects that the proto-historical community who
lived in this country abandoned their nomadic
hunting life style and got used to an agricultural
life style. The major change that occurred as they
got used to agriculture was that they started to
stay in one place for a long time. This was the
basic reason for the origin of the most ancient
villages in this country.
Those who lived in these basic villages were
engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry as
their livelihood. They engaged in hunting too.
Due to agriculture and animal husbandry their
food safety was ensured. Unless those people,
who were engaged in those two occupations,
had not been affected by natural disasters such
as droughts, floods, and epidemics among ani-
mals, their life could have been more peaceful
and co-existent.
There were signs of making a clear change among
those who lived then due to their engagement
in agriculture for a long time. It depended on a
number of facts such as the nature of agricultural
land and the skill each individual showed in
managing the agricultural activities.
The farmers who cultivated lands where the soil
was fertile and water was easily available had a
good harvest and those who cultivated in infertile
lands perhaps could have a harvest which was
hardly enough for a year’s consumption. Those,
who reaped a rich harvest, had an excess of grain
remaining in the granaries after consuming
during the whole year. This remaining grain is
introduced in the special name ‘Athirikthaya’
– surplus. When there is an economic surplus
in a society and a group of owners of surplus is
a highly transformative situation. In this way,
there is an example that shows that there lived
a surplus owners in the ancient society of this
country in ‘Jathakaatta Katha’. As it mentions,
one villager, who didn’t have enough food as he
had not received the harvest from his seasonal
crop, borrowed a bag of paddy from the village
leader on the promise that he would give it back
on the following season.
who could help poor farmers.
As the surplus owner described in the above
source was a village leader, there is an important
fact that we should understand. That is , the
major reason that affected him to be a village
leader was that he was economically rich.
There is information in the inscriptions about
the same type of provincial leaders introduced
as ‘Parumaka’ and ‘Batha’. We learnet about
‘Parumakas’ in the third chapter.
The division as rich and poor, which occurs in
the society based on the economic capability
of people, is introduced as the origin of social
stratification. One of the most
important
processes that based the origin of cities was this
separation of the society in to strata.
7.2 The First Urbanization
By 450 B.C. the social stratification
of our country had become complete
to a certain extent. Early inscriptions
substantiate that there were a large
number of chieftains who owned
production surplus, spread in the dry
zone by that time. The number of the
persons introduced by the name of
‘Parumaka’ in the inscriptions so far
is numerous. These chieftains had
been organized as families. One of
the strategies that these families used
to show and keep their power and
prestige was using articles imported
from foreign countries. Some articles
such as imported earthenware and
beads have been discovered from
excavations done in the ancient
cities such as Anuradhapura and
Tissamaharama. These things were exchanged as
a result of joining the foreign trade.
Plan no. 7.1. A sketch which displays a plan of the ancient Anuradhapura city.
This story in the ‘Jathkaatta Katha’ is a good clue
that projects the transformation happening in
the ancient society of our country. It gives us an
idea of the villager who became poor due to the
failure of his farming and the surplus owners
As Sri Lanka participated
actively in the international
trade activities operating
then in the Indian Ocean, an
immense wealth came into
the country. The minority
who was the owners of the
surplus were
production
able to live a luxurious life
as they were free from other
external problems. Since
the influx of income needed
to be administered,
requirement of a mechanism
of administration was felt.
The groups who became the
chieftains due to possession
of surplus gathered in a well
planned settlement. Such
a settlement with markets,
religious
offerings, aesthetic parks,
defensive moats, and tanks is
called a city. The description
about
in Mahawamsa
how King Pandukabhaya
planned Anuradhapura
city proves that ancient
Anuradhapura city was
such a planned one with
a finish.

farmers and their efficient engagement in industries including iron industry and irrigation technology
for a long time. Magama city which was in the Southern province was like a mirror which reflected the
cultural advancement of that province.
After the 6th century A.D., the international trade operating in the Indian Ocean fell into the hands
of Arab traders. The Western part of the Indian Ocean, which was the geographical centre of the
international trade affairs in the Indian Ocean, was widened and the South-eastern Asia and the
Fig. 7.1. Thuparama Stupa in a ruined and overgrown state. After the downfall of the Anuradhapura kingdom, all of such
monuments were ruined. This photograph was taken before the reconstructions of the recent time.
Southern China were annexed to it. After the
9th century A.D., the trade in the Indian Ocean
was centering on the Eastern part of the Indian
Ocean. Our farsighted rulers had understood the
needs of activating the ports in the Eastern coast,
administering the income which came into the
country through those ports, preventing the
threats to the security of the country from different
people who entered the country through those
places and basing a city very close to the coastal
area for ruling if Sri Lanka wanted to obtain
the benefits provided by this transformation. It
seems that this situation had influenced directly
King Vijayabahu I to select Polonnaruwa as his
ruling centre.
When we examine the social background and
the international relations existed during the
time of king Parakramabahu I, who succeeded
king Vijayabahu I, it is clear to what extent the
South-eastern Asian trade relations had affected
the political, religious and economic affairs
of Sri Lanka during that time. As Mahawamsa
mentions, several kings,who succeeded King
Vijayabahu I, had married royal women from
Asian countries such as, Burma and Cambodia.
The South- East Asian characteristics could
prominently be seen in some of the art works
created in this country during the period
considered as the Polonnaruwa era, for example
in some architectural creations and Buddha
statues. The Buddha statues in Polonnaruwa
Gal Viharaya and the building introduced as the
Polonnaruwa Sathmahal Prasada are two best
examples for it.
7.3 Downfall of
Polonnaruwa
During the time when King
Mihindu V was the last ruler of
the Anuradhapura kingdom it
collapsed due to Chola invasions
and afterwards King Vijayabahu
I liberated the country from the
Cholas and united the country
by making Polonnaruwa his
capital. The political turmoil
which prevailed after the demise
of King Vijayabahu I due to the
internal problems was ended
and the country was reunited
by King Parakramabahu
capital
He developed
Polonnaruwa further and made
this country prosperous again
by reconstructing the irrigation
system. But, it seems that the
Polonnaruwa
into a track of gradual decline
due to the political disorders
emerged after the demise of
King Parakramabahu I. After
King Parakramabahu I, only
King Nissankamalla carried out
a strong ruling for nine years.
There were several reasons
the gradual decline
and the downfall of the
Polonnaruwa kingdom.
kingdom
Fig. 7.2. The way Polonnaruwa Lankathilaka image house looked before its recent
reconstructions. After the downfall of Polonnaruwa kingdom, the monuments such
as this went wild (The photograph belongs to the Times Studio).
1. Weak rulers came to power.
During a period of 29 years from the year 1186
in which King Parakramabahu I’s demise took
place and to the year 1215 in which the downfall
of Polonnaruwa kingdom occurred, 12 rulers
came to power from time to time. Among them,
except for the 9 years’ ruling period of King
Nissankamalla, the ruling periods of all the
others’ were limited to very brief time periods.
This clearly shows that those rulers could not
build a political stability. It caused the decline of
the Polonnaruwa kingdom.
2. Power struggle between the Pandyan and
Kalinga clans
After the death of King Vijayabahu I, the fights
between the Pandyan and Kalinga clans who were
in this country aggravated. As a result, the people
who supported the Pandyan clan tried to bring
Pandyan leaders to power. In the same way those
who supported the Kalinga clan attempted to
bring their leaders to power. As a result of this, the
Kalingas , after the death of king Nissankamalla,
who belonged to their clan, brought several
Kalinga members such as, king Nissankamalla’s
nephew (his sister’s son) Chodanga, his brother
Sahasamalla, his wife Kalyanawathi to power.
The Pandyans brought queen Leelawathi, the
wife of king Parakramabahu I, to power thrice.
Thus, the struggle between the Pandyans and
the Kalingas was a reason for the decline of the
Polonnaruwa kingdom.
3. Economic Deterioration
Since weak rulers came to power after the death of
King Nissankamalla and as they could not build
a political stability, it seems that the tanks and
anicuts were not maintained properly. As there
were political disorder at this time, provincial
ruling too may have been paralyzed. This led to
a decline in agriculture and trade. This led to a
complete economic paralysis.
4. Invasion of Kalinga Magha
The immediate reason that affected the decline
of the Polonnaruwa kingdom was the invasion
of Kalinga Magha. When Magha invaded this
country with a huge army in 1215, Sri Lankans
could not face them due to the disordered
political situation that prevailed in the country.
As a result of that, the city of Polonnaruwa and a
number of areas in Rajarata went under Magha’s
army. When we consider the destruction,
and the outcomes of the invasion of Magha, it
made a great influence not only on the capital
of Polonnaruwa, but also on the Rajarata
civilization, which had a history of not less than
one thousand and five hundred years.
This is a part from Mahawamsa, which describes
the destruction caused by Magha: “People were
tied, tortured and made them beggars by looting
their wealth; statues were broken down, temples
were robbed; devotees were attacked; children
were beaten (..by the invaders).” Thus, due to the
destructive activities of the enemies, there was
no security for the lives and properties of the
Rajarata people.
Its result was that the oppressed monks and
the people migrated to Ruhuna, Malaya Rata
(upcountry) or Maya rata
for protection.
Therefore, many areas in Rajarata were devoid
of people. Some parts freed from the central
ruling became rural areas. The religious places
such as, Ruwanweli Seya, Abhayagiriya, and
Jethawanaramaya, which were worshipped daily,
were gradually went into wilderness. Many
populated cities in Anuradhapura became ruins.
The reasons for the decline of the ancient cities :
• Invasions of the enemies
• Downfall of the central ruling
• Lack of security
• Paralysis of the trade and transport affairs
• Migration of people to other areas
7.4 The Second Urbanization
When the prosperous cities existing in the dry
zone declined, several cities, especially outside
the dry zone, emerged in the South-eastern areas
in no time. The emergence of these cities is a result
of another process of urbanization. Operating
several ruling centres due to decentralization
of political power, growth of new harbours,
reflecting a new intelligence awakening due to the
rebirth of literature provide a sufficient base to
introduce this process as a second urbanization.
Another important trend that should be taken
into consideration regarding the advancement
of urbanization during this time is setting up
of new trade relations network and widening of
commercial activities with that.
When we compare the cities originated in the
second urbanization process with the great
cities that existed in the previous era, the main
feature that could be seen is that the plans of
the cities developed in the second urbanization
had freed from the geometric structures of the
previous ones. Even in the size, they were not
as large as the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa
ones. The scholars point out the reason for that
is the decentralization of power after the second
urbanization.
Dambadeniya
The period from the downfall of the Polonnaruwa
kingdom in 1215 A.D to the establishment of
the Dambadeniya kingdom in 1232 A.D was
a chaotic time in this country. Mahawamsa
mentions that in this difficult time when the
capital was in the hands of the enemies, some
local leaders had protected both the country
and Buddhism from the enemies by building
inaccessible places in safe areas. Subha Senevi
who protected the area from enemies by building
an inaccessible place in the Yapahuwa rock, the
duke Buwanekabahu who prevented enemies
from entering Ruhuna by making a citadel at
the top of the Govindamalaya mountain, and
Sankha Senevi who had built a citadel in the rock
in Gandeniya close to Mahiyangana area were
prominent among them.
Though they took much pains to act for the
security of the country, none had a hope of going
beyond their own purpose, which was defending
their own ruling area, and uniting the country
suppressing the enemy. It seems only one person
acted with this purpose. He was a chieftain
named Vijayabahu III. He lived in Dambadeniya.
He ruled making Dambadeniya as his ruling
centre in between 1232-1236. During this time
Dambadeniya got developed consisting of all
that needed for a city.
King Vijayabahu III established the Dambadeniya
kingdom in 1232. His relationship with the old
royal family in Anuradhapura is not clear. The
sources mention that this king was a Wanni
Nayaka- provincial leader earlier. Wanni means
a kind of provincial ruling unit originated after
the downfall of the Rajarata civilization. In this
way, it seems that king Vijayabahu III too was
a provincial leader at first, gradually became
powerful, dispelled the enemies who were in
Maya Rata and built Dambadeniya as his ruling
centre. When Polonnaruwa was surrendered
by enemies, the Bhikkus protected the tooth
relic and the bowl relic. They took those sacred
objects to Kothmale and protected them. King
Vijayabahu III came to know of this and took
steps to bring them to Dambadeniya. He built a
Dalada Maligawa at Beligala and deposited them
in it. This task of the king added an importance
to the Dambadeniya Kingdom as the people
considered that the possession of the tooth relic
was the legal receipt of kingship. King Vijayabahu
III performed a number of religious and national
such as building Dambadeniya
activities
Vijesundararamaya,
reconstructing Kelani
temple, making a Sanga amendment by holding
the Upasampada festival again and taking steps
to rewrite the books in disuse. His ruling time
was 4 years and he died in 1236.
King Parakramabahu II(1236 A.D. – 1270 A.D.)
King Vijayabahu III had two sons namely
Parakramabahu and Buvanekabahu. After his
death, his elder son, Parakramabahu became the
king of Dambadeniya in 1236. He is named as
king Parakramabahu II. King Parakramabahu
II had a good education in his childhood. He
had his education from the Bhikkus led by
Sangharakkhitha Thero when his father was
living and later became an educated erudite.
He was offered the scholarly title Kalikala
Sahithya Sarwagna Panditha. The great books he
composed remain even today.
By the time king Parakramabahu II attained the
kingship, the country was not freed from the
clutches of the enemies. And also he had to face
a new invader. He had a number of challenges
before him, including bringing the life style
of the countrymen to normalcy and acting for
Plan No. 7.3. A sketch of the plan of the ancient Yapahuwa city.
the betterment of religion and education.
However, the king was able to overcome all
these challenges since he was educated and
intelligent.
When King Parakramabahu II was getting
ready to fight with Kalinga Magha that is
in the 11th year of his ruling (1247 A.D.),
a Javaka invader named Chandrabhanu
landed in this country with a large group of
soldiers. Though all the invasions came to
Sri Lanka from India so far, Chandrabhanu
arrived from the Northern part of the
Malaya peninsula in the South- East Asia.
As that area was a Buddhist country then,
the purpose of Chandrabhanu may have
been to possess the sacred Buddhist relics.
In 1247 A.D. Chandrabhanu’s army was
repulsed by the Sri Lankan army led by
king Parakramabahu II.
greatest
challenge
that King
Parakramabahu II had to face was to
liberate the country from Magha’s ruling.
Magha ruled the areas in Rajarata for
about 40 years and had reinforced the security
by building citadels around the area. Therefore,
a decisive attack had to be made on Magha.
According to a plan of the king, the army was
directed to besiege Polonnaruwa city from the
eastern and western sides. Magha’s soldiers,
in the surrounding citadels, had gathered to
Polonnaruwa to face the king’s army. Magha’s
army had had a debacle at the attack launched
by the king’s army. It is believed that this decisive
battle took place in around 1255 A.D. Liberating
the country from Magha was a great achievement
of the king.
Chandrabhanu, who fled after suffering a
defeat in the previous battle with the army of
the king, had invaded Sri Lanka once again
in about 1261 A.D. by obtaining mercenary
soldiers from India. Chandrabhanu, who came
with a large army, besieged Yapahuwa and
threatened the king to hand over the state, the
tooth relic and the bowl relic. Once again there
was a great battle between the king’s army and
the army of Chandrabhanu. In this battle king
Parakramabahu II had the support from the
Pandyan Empire. In this battle, the enemies were
defeated and the invader Chandrabhanu too
was killed. King Parakramabahu II saved the
country from the enemies and at the same time
he took steps to use the minister named Deva
Pathiraja to develop the economic, religious and
educational sectors.
Yapahuwa
As king Parakramabahu II passed away in about
1270 A.D, his son prince Vijayabahu attained
the kingship. He is named as Vijayabahu IV.
The name Bosath Vijayabahu too was used for
him. His reign was limited only for two years.
He died due to a military coup. After that, prince
Buvanekabahu, who was the brother of king
Vijayabahu IV, overcame the conspirators and
became the king in about 1272. He is named
as king Buvanekabahu I. He faced a number of
problems. As soon as he became the king, a group
of provincial leaders rebelled against him. During
the same time several south Indian forces invaded
Sri Lanka. One invasion was led by an army
general named Kalingarayara. Another platoon
was led by one army general named Chodanga.
The king faced all these adversaries successfully
and spent a few years in Dambadeniya. Later
the king selected Yapahuwa, since it was a safer
place, as his capital. King Buvanekabahu I was
very interested in having trade relations with
foreign countries. It is reported that a group of
ambassadors sent by the king to the Sultan in
Egypt to discuss to develop trade relations with
Egypt had been welcomed in Cairo in the month
of April in 1283. After some time of that event,
king Buvanekabahu I died in 1284.
Plan no. 7.4 A sketch of the
ancient Kurunegala city.
It seems after the demise of king Buvanekabahu,
a dispute was
among prince
started
Parakramabahu, the son of Bosath Vijayabahu
and prince Buvanekabahu II, the son of king
Buvanekabahu I about the kingship. During
this time a provincial leader from the South
India named Arya Chackrawarthi had arrived
in Sri Lanka with a Pandya army, attacked the
Yapahuwa citadel, took the tooth relic to South
India and handed it over to King Kulashekara,
who was the Pandyan king. Later the son of king
Bosath Vijayabahu, prince Parakramabahu went
to India, met king Kulashekara, discussed with
him and brought the tooth relic back. He went to
Polonnaruwa and started his ruling. This king is
named as Parakramabahu III. His ruling period
started in 1287 A.D. But, prince Buvanekabahu
II besieged Polonnaruwa, defeated the king and
took back the tooth relic to Kurunegala in about
1293. He made Kurunegala his
capital.
Kurunegala
The first ruler who established the
Kurunegala kingdom was king
Buvanekabahu II. His ruling time
was 9 years from 1293 A.D. After
the death of king Buvanekabahu
II, his son, prince Parakramabahu
acceded
Kurunegala. Since he was the
fourth Parakramabahu we meet
in the history of this country, he
is named as Parakramabahu IV.
According to the Tamil poetry
Sarajothimaleyi, he became the
king in 1302 A.D.
the kingship
Much service was done to the
uplifting of Buddhism as well as
education during the Kurunegala
ruling period. One of the most
prominent services done during
this era was translating the Jataka story book,
which was in Pali language until then, into
Sinhala. The texts like Dalada Siritha, Sinhala
Bodhiwamsa, Anagatha Wamsaya, and Dalada
Poojavaliya were written during this period. It
is mentioned that after king Parakramabahu IV,
the two kings named Buvanekabahu III or Vanni
Buvanekabahu and Vijayabahu V or Savulu
Vijayabahu ruled Kurunegala respectively. Much
information has not been disclosed about the
activities of these kings. However, folklores
mention that king Buvanekabahu III constructed
the Kurunegala tank.
Gampola Kingdom
The Gampola kingdom was established by king
Buvanekabahu IV in 1341. He is believed to be
a son of King Savulu Vijayabahu, who was the
last ruler of the Kurunegala kingdom. King
Buvanekabahu IV had another brother and he
maintained his ruling by building a kingdom
in Dedigama at the same time period as
Parakramabahu V. When the Gampola kingdom
started, there were two other kingdoms except
for Dedigama. There was a kingdom in Jaffna
under Aryachakravarthi dynasty and another
one in Rayigama under Alakeshwara lineage.
Therefore, the Gampola kingdom had to face
many challenges.
There were several special characteristics of
the Gampola ruling period. There were two
respectable–families having connections with
the Royal family, which was one characteristic.
Senadhilankara Senevirath family in Gampola
was one. Senadhilankara Senevi Dedigama had
married a sister of King Parakramabahu III and
the one who became the king in Gampola in the
name of Vikramabahu was a son of them. The
second respectable family was the Alakeshwara
family in Rayigama. The prominent figure in this
family was Nissanka Alakeshwara.
In the Gampola period, kingship did not pass to
son from father or from brother to brother. It was
the old system. The system which was practised
in Gampola period was passing kingship from
uncle to nephew or to a son of a sister of the ex-
king. This was a mother-central system (matriachy)
more than a father-central system (patriachy).
One significant fact was that one Arab traveller
named Iban Batuta came to Sri Lanka during
the Gampola period and he recorded what he
witnessed and heard. Iban Batuta, who came to
Jaffna in 1344, had journeyed to Adam’s Peak
(Sri Pada) by gaining assistance from the Jaffna
ruler, Arya Chakravarthi. Batuta mentions a
ruler named Alakonar who possessed a white
elephant (tusker). That Alakonar was a one of the
Alagakkonara lineage.
It is mentioned by the ruling period of Gampola
Vikramabahu III the officers of Aryachakravarthi
in the North had come to Gampola and collected
taxes from some areas. This was a blow not only
to the independence of the Gampola kingdom
but also to its economy. Therefore, the chief
minister of the King, Nissanka Alakeshvara,
built a fortress in Kotte and had punished the
tax officers of the King Aryachakravarthi. When
Aryachakravarthi, who was angry with this
treatment, invaded Gampola kingdom, his army
was defeated by the Alakeshwara’s army. Though
the actions followed by Nissanka Alakeshvara
made the Gampola kingdom strong, it seems
with time there were disputes among the
Alakeshwara family itself.
In the last period of the Gampola kingdom, there
was a Chinese invasion in Sri Lanka. An army
general named Chen Ho sent by the Chinese
emperor called Yung Lo landed in this country
in the years of 1405, 1409, and 1411. When he
came to this country in 1409, the then Rayigama
ruler Veera Alakeshvara had not welcomed
Chen Ho properly. Therefore, he had offered
the offerings he had brought to the Devundara
Devala and left after making an inscription
written in Chinese, Persian and Tamil languages.
That inscription is known as the Trilingual letter
in Galle. Afterwards general Chen Ho, who came
to this country back in 1411 with a large army
Map 7.1 The distribution of ancient kingdoms in Sri Lanka.
and fought against the army of Alakeshvara
and captured him along with some others as
prisoners, and went back to China.
Several buildings, constructed during
Gampola ruling period still remain and
Lankathilaka and Gadaladeni temples built by
king Buvanekabahu IV are prominent among
them.
Kotte Kingdom
We mentioned above that minister Nissanka
Alakeshvara built a strong fortress in Kotte
during the Gampola ruling period. But, the Kotte
kingdom was established by king Parakramabahu
VI. His father was one Jayamahalena. His
mother was Sunethra Devi. Since there were
adversaries during the last part of the Gampola
ruling period, prince Parakramabahu had to
live in hiding. Here, Veedagama Thero provided
him protection. Afterwards, in 1412 prince
Parakramabahu came to power in Rayigama
with the courtesy of Veedagama Thero. After
three years’ time in 1415 he came to Kotte,
which was famous as a safe place, and held his
coronation. From then on he ruled the country
for a long time until 1467. These are prominent
in King Parakramabahu’s service.
• Bringing Wanni areas under the Kotte kingdom.
• Winning Jaffna by sending the army under
prince Sapumal.
• Suppressing the rebellion raised by Count
Jothiya, who was the provincial ruler of Uda
Rata.
• Uniting the country under the Kotte kingdom
and making the country prosperous.
• Making a great contribution to the enhancement
of country’s education and literature.
As there was not an heir to the throne after
king Parakramabahu VI's demise, the son of
his daughter, Ulakudaya Deviya, acceded to the
throne in the name of Jayabahu. But his ruling
time was short. Prince Sapumal, who was assigned
to rule Jaffna by King Parakramabahu VI after
capturing Jaffna, came with an army, besieged
Kotte capital and usurped power by assassinating
king Jayabhu. He became the king in the name of
Buvanekabahu VI in 1469. At the beginning of his
ruling a rebellion named Pasyodun Rata Sinhala
Peraliya or Sinhala Sange started. This rebellion
was suppressed by prince Ambulugala under
the guidance of King Buvanekabahu. The king
forgave the rebel leaders including Kekulandala
Siriwardana Pathiraja. The inscription made
for this is known as ‘Abhayadana Shilalipiya’ or
‘Dedigama Inscription’.
After the demise of king Buvanekabahu VI, one
of his sons named Panditha Parakramabahu
came to power. He was known as Parkaramabahu
VII and his ruling time was not a long one.
Prince Ambulgala, who was in charge of ruling
affairs in Sathara Koralaya, came, dethroned
Panditha Parakramabahu and became the king
in the name of Veera Parakramabahu VIII. It is
believed that he came to power in 1490 A.D. The
Portuguese arrived in this country during his
ruling time in 1505.
Jaffna and the Vanniyars
The ruling unit, which started in the Jaffna
area after the downfall of Rajarata civilization,
is known as the Jaffna kingdom. There are no
contemporary sources to study the beginning
and the history of this kingdom and the most
famous book which assists to study its history is
Yalpana Vayipava Maleyi. But it was written in
the 18th century. Apart from these, the Tamil texts
such as Kayilaya Maleyi and Shegarashashekara
Maleyi are also important.
The founder of the Jaffna kingdom was Vijay
Kulankeyi Arya Chakravarthi. There
description in the Yalpana Vayipava Maleyi
text about twelve rulers such as Kulashekara,
Vikkirama, Varodaya, Marthanda from the
ruling time of Arya Chakravarthi to the arrival of
Portuguese. The royal dynasty who ruled Jaffna
was named as Arya Chakravarthis. It seems
when Iban Batuta came to this country in 1344,
the Arya Chakravarthis had a strong ruling. We
mentioned earlier how minister Nishshanka
Alakeshvara acted against the representatives
of Arya Chakravarthi, who collected taxes in
the areas belonging to the Gampola kingdom.
During the Kotte period King Parakramabahu
VI sent prince Sapumal and brought Jaffna under
the Kotte kingdom. After king Parakrambahu
VI, the ruling over the Jaffna area loosened from
the grip of Kotte. From then on we will discuss
the information of the Jaffna kingdom until
it surrendered to the Portuguese in the tenth
lesson.
The Vanniyars
After the downfall of Rajarata civilization, small
ruling units called Vanni emerged in the areas
with low population density, such as East, North
central and North Western. The provincial rulers
in these units were known as the Vanniyars.
According to Poojavaliya Vijayabahu III who
established the Dambadeniya kingdom was a
Vanni leader at first. The contemporary sources
say that there were eighteen such Vanni areas by
the time when king Parakramabahu VI started
his ruling. Though the Vanniyars enjoyed
some independence during the time when the
central government was weak, during the ruling
periods of King Parakramabahu II and king
Parakramabahu VI the Vanni areas were under
the main kingdom. There is information that
there were Vanniyars in the Eastern area during
the Kandyan kingdom. But they were under the
Kandyan king.
environment. Origin of kingdoms in the areas
where there were ghats and non existence of the
capital at one place for a long time are special
features of this. As the wet zone received a good
rainfall, it seems that they did not pay much
attention to construct huge tanks and irrigation
systems. They tended to use rainwater for the
agricultural activities. Even during this time,
their main livelihood was agriculture. The main
cultivation was paddy and Chena cultivation was
done in areas which lacked water.
Gradually they tended to a commercial economy.
The surplus of the crops grown for food was sold.
The reason for this was that the international
trade relations got more developed.
Cinnamon, which grew in the forest areas in
the wet zone, was a main trade crop during this
time. The surplus of the crops such as aricanuts,
cardamom, nutmeg and pepper was exported.
Apart from these, trade items such as pearls,
gems, tuskers and tusks were exported.
Sri Lanka had trade relations with India, Arab,
China, Persia and Egypt. International trade was
under the monopoly of king.
The rich trade that existed in ancient Sri Lanka
has been mentioned in literary, archaeological
sources as well as in tourist records. The
archaeological evidences found in Dedigama
reveal that porcelain has been imported from
China. The ola
leaves called Kurunegala
description mentions that there were bazaars
related to internal trade. The Arab traveller
named Iban Batuta, who came to Sri Lanka in
1344 A.D., has mentioned in his records that
there was a rich trading in harbours in the
Western coasts.

to adjust themselves to a new geographical

second urbanization period
Buddhism grew as further as the main religion.
The kings from Dambadeni to Kotte periods
acted to build palaces for the sacred Tooth relic
and construct many temples and monasteries.
There are proofs that the people of this time had
a great devotion and belief in god. They believed
in the gods such as Upulwan, Vibheeshana,
Skandakumar and Saman and constructed
Devalas for the gods. There is a reference to
the gods Upulwan and Vibhishana in Sandesha
Kavyas.
There is information that there was a Shiva
Devala adjacent to Sri Jayawardhanpura in the
fifteenth century. It is believed that it must have
been constructed for Siva devotees.
The Munneshvaram temple in Chilaw was a
sacred religious place for the Hindus during this
time.
There were sacred Islamic religious places in sea-
port areas where the Muslim devotees resided
and engaged in their international trade affairs.
7.4.3 Arts and Architecture
A lot of architecture could be seen in the cities,
which were created from Yapahuwa period to
Kotte period. It is a special feature that these
creations have been influenced by the South
Indian architecture.
It is believed that the steps in the Yapahuwa
kingdom and creations of its posts have had the
Pandyan and Cambodian influences. It could
clearly be noticed that the contemporary South
Indian architectural styles had influenced the
Pilimageya (Idol-house) at the Gadaladeniya
temple which belonged to the Gampola period.
Another feature that could be seen in these
periods is constructing Devals connecting to the
Pilimageyas (Idol-houses).
One example for this is that a Devala has
been built for God Upulvan connecting to the
Gadaladeniya Pilimageya. Devalas have been
built connecting to Lankathilaka Pilimageya
too. Having Devalas in the idol-houses is a proof
that displays that the Hindu and Mahayana ideas
influenced the architecture.
The Embekke Devala, which was constructed
by king Wickramabahu III during the Gampola
period is a valuable construction with wood
carvings. Its magnificence is displayed by its
posts with beautiful wood carvings and its
wooden roof.
There are a lot of evidences to prove that there was
a great revival in language and literature during
the second urbanization. Learned monks, kings’
sponsoring, and having a number of educational
centres influenced the advancement of literature.
During the ruling period of King Parakramabahu
II in Dambadeniya, many literary texts were
written. He was given the honorary title Kalikala
Sahithya Sarvagna Panditha. Several literary
texts were written by him. It is accepted that
Kawsilumina, one of the great Sinhalese literary
works, was written by King Parakramabahu II.
Saddharmarathnawaliya written by Dharmasena
Thero, and Poojawaliya written by Mayurapada
Parivenadhipathi Buddhaputhra Thero were
two significant prose texts written during
the Dambadeniya period. Sidath Sangarawa
on Sinhalese grammar, Elusandes Lakuna
on prosody too belonged to
this period.
Dambadeni Kathikavatha, which consists of the
disciplinary rules of the monks, Kandawuru
Siritha, which describes the daily routine of king
Parakramabahu II and the valuable medicinal
text name Yogarnvaya written by Buddha Puthra
Thero were written during the Dambdeniya
period. There are several important texts written
in Pali language during this time. Vishuddhi
Marga
Samanthakuta Varnana,
Rasavahini, Sara Sangrahaya, the medicinal book
named Bhessajja Manjusa, Hathvanagalla Vihara
Vansaya and Thupavamsa are examples for that.
Sannasa,
During Kurunegala period the Sinhalese prose
literature was further advanced. Translating
Pansiya Panas Jataka Potha into Sinhala, Dalada
Siritha, Dalda Poojavaliya, and Sinhala Bodhi
Vamsa were written during this period.
Writing Sandesha Kavya started during the
Gampola period. Mayura Sandesha and
Thisara Sandesha are considered as the oldest
Sandesha Kavyas. Pali texts such as Parami
Shathakaya, Jeenabodhavali, Balavathara and
Saddharmalankaraya too were written during
this period.
The Kotte period was the golden age of
Sinhalese literature. The period of Perakumba
VI made a great service to the literature. King
Parakramabahu VI was a great ruler as well
as a pedant. There were a number of learned
people who contributed to the advancement of
literature.
Thotagamuve Sri Rahula Thero, Keragala
Vanarathana Thero, Irugalthilaka Piriven Thero
were learned monks who nurtured the literature.
Siritha,
Kavyashekaraya,
Perakumba
Budugunalankaraya, Loweda Sangarava, Guttila
Kavya, Hansa, Parevi, Gira, Selalihini Sandesha
Kavayas were written by these literati.
Another important feature is that the texts
like Bhakthi Kavya, Shilo Kavya, Hatan Kavya,
Prashasthi Kavya, Upadesha Kavya, Kosha
Grantha, directed the literature to different
aspects. Sanskrit texts too were written and
Bhakthi Shathakaya is an example for that.
A number of Buddhist educational centres came
into being during this time. King Parakramabahu
VI built Pepilayane Sunethradevi Pirivena in
memory of his mother. The Buddhist centers such
as Keragala Padmavathi Pirivena, Devinuvara
Veedagama
Irugalkulathilaka
Ghunananda Pirivena did a great service to the
advancement of literature.
Pirivena,
Important Facts
 One of the main factors that affected to transfer
the ancient kingdoms in Sri Lanka was changing
of the city centres. The situations arose in the
country and the transformations occurred in the
international trade too affected that situation.
 The process of origin of cities in the ancient
time of this country can be analyzed through
two processes named the first urbanization
and the second urbanization. There are distinct
differences in the cities which emerged from
these two processes.
 Those urbanizing processes and series of
activities that took place centred on the cities
should be understood through the socio-
political background on which those processes
originated.
 After the downfall of Polonnaruwa kingdom,
several other kingdoms namely, Dambadeniya,
Yapahuwa, Kurunegala, Gampola and Kotte
came into being. The Jaffna kingdom had started
in Jaffna.
 There was a great revival in educational and
literary spheres during the Kotte period.

8 Kandyan Kingdom
Introduction
After the collapse of the Kotte and the
Seethawaka kingdoms, it was the responsibility
of the Kandyan kingdom to protect the
independence of the country. Until 1815 the
kings and the people of that kingdom fulfilled
facing
this responsibility completely by
numerous challenges never faced by any
kingdom that prevailed in this country. In this
unit you will learn about the beginning of the
Kandyan kingdom, which was the last kingdom
in Sri Lanka, its expansion, its administration
and its social and economic patterns.
8.1 Beginning and Expansion
The Kandyan kingdom was known by various
names such as Senkadagala Nuwara, Udarata
Rajadhaniya, Kande Nuwara, Mahanuwara
Rajadhaniya.
The capital of the Kanda Udarata Rajadhaniya was
Kandy (Mahanuwara). It is a naturally protected
location. The city of Kandy is protected by the
river of Mahaweli. It is very difficult to access
this city due to the ghats such as Balana and
Hunnasgiriya. Further, the Kandyan kingdom
consists of a balmy climate and a fertile land.
King Senasammatha Vickramabahu made
Kandy an independent kingdom for the first
time. It was a provincial ruling unit under
the Kotte kingdom during the ruling period
of king Parakramabahu VI. Therefore, King
Senasammatha Vickramabahu is considered as
the founder of the Kandyan kingdom.
successor
Senasammatha
Vickramabahu was his son, Jayaweera Bandara
(1511-1551). He ruled the kingdom, for a long
time. He was a friend of king Mayadunne, who
was the ruler of Seethawaka. In the incident
“Vijayaba Kollaya” that took place against
king Vijayabahu VI, who was the then ruler of
Kotte, king Jayaweera Bandara supported king
Mayadunne.
supported
Jayaweera Bandara, his
After King
Karaliyedde Bandara acceded to the throne
of Kandy. He maintained a friendly policy
with the Portuguese. The Kandyan chieftains
were unhappy about this policy of Karaliyadde
Bandara. Therefore,
Seethawaka ruler, king Rajasinghe. Peradeniye
Veerasundara Bandara, who was a chieftain
of Kandy, assisted king Rajasinghe I to invade
Kandy. Karaliyadde Bandara, who could not
face this invasion, fled to the Portuguese with
his daughter Kusumasana Devi and his son in
law, Yamasinghe Bandara. Kusumasana Devi
was baptized in the name of Dona Kathirina and
Yamasinghe Bandara as Don Philip.
King Rajasinghe I, who captured Kandy in 1580,
ruled the areas in Kandy from Seethawaka.
But, king Rajasinghe I suspected Veerasundara
Bandara and tactfully killed him. After this
incident, the son of Veerasundara Bandara fled
to the Poruguese and was baptized in the name
of Don Juan of Austria.
The Kandyan chieftains were dissatisfied with
the policies of king Seethawaka Rajasinghe
on Kandy. As a result, the Portuguese, who
took the advantage from this opportunity, sent
Yamasinghe Bandara who was under their care
to Kandy and established a ruling, which was
loyal to the Portuguese, with the help of some
Kandyan chieftains. On the occasion when the

Portuguese sent Yamasinghe Bandara to Kandy,
they sent Konappu Bandara, who was the son of
Veerasundara Bandara, too with the army who
went for his protection. As Yamasinghe Bandara,
who was a puppet of the Portuguese, died in a
short time, the Portuguese attempted to make the
youngest son of Yamasinghe Bandara the king of
Kandy. But it was unsuccessful due to Konappu
Bandara. Konappu Bandara, who got the support
of the Kandyans, captured the power of Kandy
against the Portuguese and became the king in
the name of Vimaladharmasooriya I. Due to this
brave action of Konappu Bandara, the possibility
of a Portuguese ruling in the Kandyan kingdom
was prevented.
King Vimaladharmasooriya I (1592 – 1604)
King Vimaladharmasooriya I, who became
the king after Yamasinghe Bandara, was the
son of Weerasundara Bandara. He was the
beginner of a new dynasty in Kandy. After king
Vimaladharmasooriya I came to power, there
were several challenges faced by him.
1. Not having a legal royal inheritance.
2. Had to liberate the Kandyan kingdom from
the clutches of the Portuguese.
3. Protecting

Seethawaka influences.
4. Had to rebuild the declined Buddha Sasana.
5. Had to enhance the economic affairs of the
Kandyan kingdom.
 King Vimaladharmasooriya I took several
steps to establish his legal right to the Kandyan
kingdom.
1. Establishing his right by marrying Kusumasana
Devi who had a legal right to the Kandyan
kingdom.
2. Abandoning Roman Catholic religion and
embracing Buddhism.
3. Getting

4. Bringing the Sacred Tooth Relic,which was
hidden in the temple of Delgamu, to Kandy.
 The king defeated king Rajasinghe I with
the help of the Kandyans in order to protect the
country from the influences of the kingdom of
Seethawaka.
 There were several steps that the king took to
save the Kandyan kingdom from the clutches
of the Portuguese.
1. Defeating the Portuguese completely in the
battle of Danthure in 1594 A.D.
2. Supporting

3. Try to get the assistance of the Dutch to expel
the Portuguese.
 King Vimaladharmasooriya took several
steps to rebuild the declined Buddhism.
1. Bringing Upasampada from Mianmar.
2. Renovating old temples such as Lankathilaka,
Ridee Viharaya and Gadaladeniya.
The king took several measures for the
economic development of
the Kandyan
kingdom.
1. Taking actions to develop agriculture.
2. Encourage to enhance the cotton cultivation.
3. Developing the iron and steel industries in
Kotmale and Walapane.
4. Take steps to develop nitre industry in the
Kandyan kingdom.
King Vimaladharamasooriya I, who attempted
to develop the kingdom of Kandy in this way,
died in 1604 A.D. after being infected with a
sudden fever.
Fig. 8.1. A drawing of King Rajasinghe II. This was drawn by the
British national named Robert Knox, who stayed in this country.
King Senarath (1604- 1635 A.D)
When king Vimaladharmasooriya I passed away,
his sons were at a very young age. Therefore, a
cousin brother of King Vimaladharmasooriya
I named prince Senarath became the king of
Kandy in 1604. There were several challenges
that he had to face.
1. Establishing his royal inheritance in the
Kandyan kingdom.
2. Minimizing the threats that came from the
Portuguese against the Kandyan kingdom.
During the early period of the King Senarath’s
ruling, he married Kusumasana Devi (Dona
Kathirina) and established his kingship.
Queen Kusumasana Devi had two sons from
King Vimaladharmasooriya I and one son from
king Senarath. Among them, the cleverer one
was Prince Maha Asthana (Prince Rajasinghe II).
In order to avoid the competition between the
princes for the kingship, king Senarath divided
the Kandyan kingdom into three parts and gave
each one to each prince. Accordingly, Uva area
was given to prince Kumarasinghe; Matale area
was given to prince Vijepala; Kandy area was
given to prince Rajasinghe.
Prince Maha Asthana alias Rajasinghe II assisted
his father to protect the Kandyan kingdom from
the Portuguese. He was a great warrior and he
annihilated the Portuguese in the battle of Uva-
Randeniwala in 1630. Further, he attacked and
paralized the Portuguese villages on the borders
in Kandy.
King Rajasinghe II (1635- 1687 A.D.)
Prince Rajasinghe acceded to the throne of
Kandy as Rajasinghe II with the demise of king
Senarath in 1635. He faced several challenges
during his ruling time.
1. Preventing the attacks of the Portuguese to the
Kandyan kingdom.
2. Expelling the Portuguese from this country.
3. Minimizing the threats to the Kandyan
kingdom from the chieftains.
4. Liberating the Kandyan kingdom from the
Dutch influence.
The king had acted to suppress the attacks
from the Portuguese to the Kandyan kingdom
since his father’s ruling period. He defeated the
Portuguese completely
in Uva–Randeniwala
battle as well as in the Gannoruwa battle in 1638.
The king needed the assistance of a naval army
to expel the Portuguese from this country.
King Rajasinge II acted to get assistance from
the Dutch for that purpose. King Rajasinghe
II managed to expel the Portuguese from this
country by getting the support of the Dutch in
1658. Even though the Portuguese was expelled
from the country, unexpectedly the Dutch
established their power in the Portuguese areas.
The Dutch, who established their power in a
number of coastal areas, attempted constantly to
expand their ruling area from 1658.The Dutch
captured several areas in Kandy during the
years between 1665 and 1668. King Rajasinghe
II, who stayed silent during that time, launched
a number of powerful attacks during the years
between 1670 and 1675 and liberated many areas
that the Dutch had possessed. Therefore, the
Dutch, who realized the power of the Kandyan
kingdom, attempted to be peaceful with the
Kandyan kings from then on.
Establishing power by the Dutch in the coastal
areas was an impediment to the purpose of king
Rajasinghe II to become the king of the whole
country. However, when the Portuguese was
expelled from the country, the king managed
to capture more areas that had belonged to the
Portuguese. The ports such as Kalpitiya, Chilaw,
Trincomalee and Batticaloa had belonged to the
Kandyan kingdom then.
Fig. 8.2. A rare photograph which displays the Kandyan pageant and the nature of the streets of the Kandy city in the 19th
century.
King Rajasinghe
II, who made a great
contribution to the expansion of power of the
Kandyan kingdom, ruled more than 50 years and
passed away in 1687.
King Vimaladharmasooriya II (1687-1707A.D)
Rajasinghe
After
Vimaladharmasooriya II became the king.
He was not as clever as his father. Therefore, it
seemed that the Kandyan chieftains strengthened
their power during this king’s time.
By the time of King Vimaladharmasooriya II, the
higher ordinance (Upasampada) of the Kandyan
kingdom was in a state of decline once again.
Therefore, the king took measures to bring the
higher ordinance from Burma into this country
once again. There is information to state that
the Dutch assisted the king for that purpose. It
is recorded that he had renovated the Temple of
Tooth. King Vimaladharamasooriya II passed
away in 1707 A.D.
King Sri Veera Parakrama Narendrasinghe
(1707 – 1739 A.D.)
He acted peacefully with Dutch after he became
the king. Though he was not a clever ruler, he
was able to protect the areas where the power
had been expanded in the Kandyan kingdom.
Sri Veera Parakarama Narendrasinghe, who was
the son of Vimaladharmasooriya II, acceded to
the throne of the Kandyan kingdom in 1707.
The weakness of the king was that he did not
have a good knowledge on administration. The
result of this was that the Kandyan chieftains
strengthened their power further.
This king, as his father, married a South Indian
princess. They did not have children from this
marriage. The result of this was that the queen’s
brother inherited the kingship, following the
South Indian tradition.
Nayakkar Dynasty
King Sri Vijaya Rajasinghe (1739 -1747 A.D.)
King Sri Veera Parakrama Narendrasinghe
passed away in year 1739, without leaving an heir
to the throne. In this case, in accordance with
the South Indian tradition, the queen’s brother
prince Sri Vijaya Rajasinghe became the king of
the Kandyan kingdom. The new royal dynasty,
which was started with this king, is known as the
Nayakkar dynasty. The major challenge that King
Sri Vijaya Rajasinghe faced was the strengthened
power of the chieftains of the Kandyan council of
the palace. To ameliorate this situation the king
appointed his relatives to the council.
Even though this king, who had embraced
Buddhism and grown in the association of
the Buddhist Bhikkus, acted to bring higher
ordinance
instructions given by Weliwita Saranankara
Thero, his effort was not successful.
from Burma according
King Sri Vijaya Rajasinghe, who married a South
Indian princess, passed away in 1747 without
leaving a royal heir as he did not have children.
King Keerthi Sri Rajasinghe (1747 -1781 A.D)
After the death of king Sri Vijaya Rajasinghe, his
wife’s brother Keerthi Sri Rajasinghe accecded to
the throne of the Kandyan kingdom in 1747. It has
been recorded that since Keerthi Sri Rajasinghe
was at a very young age as 16 years old when he
came to power, his father Narenappa Nayakkar
interfered in the affairs of the ruling.
When king Keerthi Sri Rajasinghe came to
power, Buddhism in this country was of a very
decaying state. Therefore, according to the
instructions of Weliwita Saranankara Thero, the
king acted to create a Buddhist revival in the
country. Following are the several steps taken by
the king for that.
 Establishing higher ordinance again by
sending messengers to Thailand by the king and
accompanying the Bhikkus led by Upali Thero.
With this the beginning of the present day Siyam
sect took place.
 Renovating the temples in upcountry as well as
in low country.
 Granting the post of Sangaraja to Saranankara
Thero and assisting the Thero to create a Buddhist
revival.
 During the years between 1760 and 1765 the
good relationship between the Dutch and Kandy
collapsed. As a result, there were a few fights
between the two sides. Those conflicts ended
when the king and the Dutch signed a peace
pact between them in 1766. King Keerthi Sri
Rajasinghe too passed away without leaving an
heir to the Kandyan throne.
King Rajadhirajasinghe (1781-1798 A.D)
After the death of king Keerthi Sri Rajasinghe,
his brother became the king of Kandy in the
name of Rajadhirajasinghe. By this time disputes
were developing between the Kandyan chieftains
and the Nayakkar kings.
An important event that took place during his
ruling time was seizing the coastal areas of Sri
Lanka by the English in 1796. King Rajadhi
rajasinghe too passed away without a successor
in 1798.
King Sri Vickrama Rajasinghe (1798-1815
A.D.)
King’s Power :
After king Rajadhirajasinghe’s death, prince
Kannasami was made the king as Sri Vickrama
Rajasinghe in 1798, according to the need of the
then Maha Adikaram, Pilimathalawwe. This king
started gradually to be obedient to his Nayakkar
relatives, as a result the relationships between the
Kandyan chieftains and the king were disrupted.
Though the English invaded Kandy in 1803, the
king managed to defeat the English with the
support of the Kandyans. However, during the
last few years of the king’s ruling time he acted
cruelly. Therefore the relationship between the
king and the people was disturbed. Thus, the
English, who acted tactfully, sent their army to
Kandy and arrested the king in the month of
February in 1815. In accordance with the accord
signed between the Kandyan chieftains and the
English in the month of March in 1815, the
English possessed the Kandyan kingdom. King
Sri Vickrama Rajasinghe, who was in the English
custody, was deported to Vellor by the English
king.
8.2 The Administrative Structure of the
Kandyan Kingdom
The highest position of the administrative
hierarchy of the Kandyan kingdom was held by
the king. There were two Adikarams for the king’s
assistance. Politically, they were second only to
the king. There was a royal council to discuss the
important affairs of the kingdom. Adikarams,
Disawes, Maha Lekams, and Badde Lekams
participated in this council, which was headed
by the king. The administration of the kingdom
had been divided into several sections. Service
in the palace (Maha Vasala Sevaya) was under
the direct rule of the king; the provincial ruling
structure (Rata Wasama) was afoot through
Maha Adikarams, and under the supervision of
the king; Maha Badda alias tax structure which
was under the relevant sectional heads and
administration of temples and Devalas were the
major administrative sections.
■ The king was the one who possessed the highest
power in the country.
■ Maintaining the peace in the country and
providing protection were the king’s major tasks.
■ The king was expected to act in accordance

by maintaining the pride and grandeur of the
kingship. Providing food and drinks to the people
in the palace, providing clothes, jewellery, and
furniture to the palace were their duties. These
officers were under the direct supervision of
the king. Many Nilames and Muhandirams had
been in charge of those sections in the palace.

Badde Sanvidhanaya (Badde Structure)
Apart from the politically existed provincial
organization network, the artisans or the castes
in a Disawa had been categorized separately
according to their tasks. Though the Badde
Sanvidhanya (structure) was afoot separately at
first, it came under Disawe during the last period
of the Kandyan kingdom. Following are some
examples for the Badde Sanvidhanaya.

■ Since there were many hilly areas, lands for paddy cultivation were limited.
■ Though the Kandyan possessed the same administration as in ancient Raja Rata and Ruhun areas,
agriculture was limited due to the decline of irrigation.
■ In the precipices on the steeps of the mountains paddy cultivation was done.
■ A large quantity of land in the Kandyan kingdom was used for Chena cultivation.
■ Grains such as Kurakkan, Amu, maize, wheat and yams and sweet potatoes were cultivated.
■ Jak, bread fruit, pepper, cardamom, aricanuts, vegetables and fruits were grown in home gardens.
■ Iron, wood, metal, lacquer and reed industry were in a developed state.

9 Renaissance
Introduction
The word Renaissance means rebirth. The
historians use this word to mean the wide
transformation that took place in the fields of
art and science from the 14th to 16th centuries
A.D. in Europe.
The period in which ancient Greek and
Roman civilizations existed is called the
Pristine age in the history of Europe. The
period of around thousand years that followed
the downfall of ancient Rome civilization in
the 5th century is called the mediaeval period
in Europe. Once again an interest grew in
studying literature, art and philosophy that
existed in the ancient Greek and Roman
civilizations in the latter part of the mediaeval
era in Europe. As a result of it, the European
society experienced a broad transformation
as the Europeans utilized the art styles that
were used in the ancient Greek and Roman
civilizations once again and tended to study
literature and philosophy in depth. By this,
the above mentioned ancient civilizations
were revived. It is called the Renaissance. Due
to the transformations that occurred during
the Renaissance in every field, the mediaeval
period died out and the modern era of the
European history started.
9.1 The Reasons for the Renaissance
 Surrendering the city of Constantinople by
the Turks
Constantinople, which was a very advanced
trade city during the final part of the mediaeval
era, attracted the attention of the scholars. The
Greek and Roman literature books were stored
in libraries in the city of Contantinople and a
number of Greek and Roman scholars were
engaged in studying there. But, the Islamic
Turks surrendered this city in 1453 A.D. and
therefore, the Roman Catholic scholars found it
difficult to stay in the city any longer. Therefore,
these scholars fled to other European countries
with those books and propagated the Greek
and Roman literature and languages in those
cities. As a result, the Greek and Roman cultures
revived.
 Growth in Trade and Origin of a New Group
of Rich
There was a growth of trade and commercial
affairs between
the Eastern and Western
countries in the 12th century A.D. Therefore,
a new group of rich people originated in the
cities like Venice and Genoa in Italy with the
money they earned from trade, production and
bank affairs. Since these wealthy people did not
depend on the ancient feudal nobles, they had a
free mind to pay their attention to artistic work
and also a financial power to support it. As there
were a number of small kingdoms in Italy then,
the wealthy people who live in them offered to
support artistic affairs. It was a predominant
reason for the origin of the Renaissance from
Italy. The family called Medici who lived in the
Fig 9.1 A drawing, which displays two divine children, painted in the Sistine church by Michael Angelo.
city of Florence in Italy is a good example for a
rich family who supported the artistic affairs.
■ Criticism of the Domination of the Church
 Intellectual Revival
After the decline of the Roman civilization,
subjects like Theology, Philosophy, and Law
were the main subjects in the education system
centred in the religious institutions. But, since
new subjects such as Ancient Literature, dramas,
Phonetics and History were taught in the new
educational centres which started after the 12th
century, there was a new group of scholars by
the time of Renaissance. Another reason that
caused the intellectual revival of the Europeans
was the printing industry. After the invention
of the printing machine by Gutenberg in 1454,
printing shops were started in a number of areas
in Italy. Therefore printed books were abundant
and much interest grew in Greek and Roman
literature and drama.
By the mediaeval era, both the Pope and the
church had a great power. Therefore, the religion
had affected many aspects of human life to a great
extent. Some of the priests in the Catholic council
had tended to a more worldly life. As a result
of the revival of thinking in the Renaissance,
some weaknesses in the Catholic council were
criticized. John Wyklip in England, John Huss in
Bohemia, Irasmus in France and Martin Luther
in Germany were prominent among such critics.
How the Renaissance Transformed Europe
The Renaissance affected much to transform the
course of Europe. It transformed every section
such as academic, political, economic and
scientific.
Academic Renaissance
The Academic Renaissance means the
revival that took place in the fields of
language,
literature, arts, sculpture,
and architecture in Europe in the 15th
century.
The Revival of Language and Literature
The languages used in the mediaeval
period were tribal
languages. Latin
language was used in the affairs of
religion and law to a certain extent.
Greek language had the state of a dead
since
language. However,
studying
the books written
in Greek and
Latin languages increased during the
Renaissance, there was a revival in
those languages. This was an important
thing that happened in the Academic
Renaissance. And also, learning Latin
and Greek languages became a fashion.
Therefore, the provincial languages used
so far went into disuse.
There was a revival in literature after
the studying of books written in Greek
and Latin languages. Specially, there
was a great interest in Greek dramas.
A number of authors, who made a great service
to literature, emerged during this time. Dante,
Petrach, Baccasio in Italy, Sir Thomas Moor,
Francis Bacon and William Shakespeare in
England and Irasmus in France were prominent.
They wrote a number of books. Divine Commedia
written by Alguri Dante and the Sonnets for Lora
written by Petrach can be taken as examples.
Humanism
Humanism or considering man as noble was
a prominent feature in the Renaissance. In the
mediaeval period everything was based on
religion and therefore, everything happened
framework. But, with
within a religious
Fig 9.2 A drawing, which displays how Galileo Galili examined the space
through his telescope. Scientific inventions was a prominent feature in
the European Renaissance.
humanism Europe started to look at everything
critically. Humanistic subjects were taught
instead of theological subjects. For example,
subjects like literature, history, art, law and
ethics were taught. Therefore, many authors who
had the Greek and Roman influence and tended
to humanism, emerged in this period.
Arts and Crafts
Transformations that took place in the fields
of Arts and Crafts
All the craftsmen were organized in grades in
the mediaeval period. Therefore, the creations
of the mediaeval period were called by grades.
Another special feature was that arts and crafts
had religious characteristics. The reasons for that
were that only the church had the strength to
support the arts and the mediaeval thinking had
been built upon religious teachings. Therefore
the artists were not independent enough to
make creations according to their talents. But,
during the Renaissance everything changed. The
rich, who appreciated worldly pleasure, offered
to support the artists during the Renaissance.
As individualism was appreciated during the
Renaissance, the artists started making their
their
creations
talents. They started to produce the artworks by
the names of artists, which had been introduced
by the grades so far. Therefore, a number of
artworks, which displayed worldly pleasure
instead of religious thoughts, were produced.
independently by showing
Paintings
Paintings, among other arts and crafts, had a
broad transformation during the Renaissance.
The city of Florence was a centre which produced
a new art of painting. As the creations were made
giving priority to the worldly pleasure, paintings
and sculptures in this period displayed nude
and half nude figures. So far the personalities
related to religion like Jesus Christ and Mother
Mary were the subjects of paintings. But in the
Renaissance the figures of wealthy people were
drawn. Leonardo Da Vinci, Micheal Angelo,
Raphael, Masekshio, and Botta Chelli were
important painters in this period.
Leonardo Da Vinci was clever at many fields in
addition to painting. He was a poet, a musician,
a scientist and a practical engineer. His paintings
such as Monalisa and last supper of Jesus Christ
have been considered as great masterpieces
even at present. Michael Angelo was also a great
painter as well as a sculptor and an architect.
The paintings which he drew on the ceiling of
the Sistine church displays the greatness of his
paintings. The painting ‘Last Judgement’ and
"The Painting of Adam" drawn in the Sistine
church itself are important among his paintings.
Sculpture
Sculpture too had an important place among
the arts and crafts during the Renaissance.
Sculpturing in alabaster was a prominent feature
at that time. Michael Angelo was a great sculptor.
He has sculptured Lorenso Medici of the Medici
family out of alabaster. The statues of Pieta,
Moses, and David are among his other creations.
Architecture
There were significant changes in architecture
during the Renaissance. The special feature of the
architecture in the mediaeval period was high
roofs in the shape of pointed cone and pillars in
the shape of pyramids. Instead, the main features
in the architecture during the Renaissance were
the circular archs, high pillars and half round
domes according to the Roman architecture.
luxurious castles were constructed
imitating the Romans.
The buildings such as Saint Peter’s Basilica
church, and Seat Church in Florence are among
the constructions which reflect their architecture.
Michael Anjelo, Leonardo Da Vinci and Raphael
were talented architects in the Renaissance
period.
Scientific Advancement
Another significant feature of the Renaissance
was the advancement of science. The scholars,
who were influenced by the Greek books, tended
to experiment scientifically without being
confined to one field. They observed everything
including the earth, the sun, the moon and the
stars. As a result, they put forward novel ideas on
the universe. And also there was advancement in
science too.
Novel ideas on the Universe

other planets rotate around the earth. Since he

and discovered that there are craters on the moon
and sub planets around Jupiter. He is known as
the father of experiment.

He discovered the law of gravitation.
Johannes Keplar (German)
He confirmed the propositions put forwarded by
Copernicus and he further discovered that the
planets in the solar system go round it.

Advancement in Medicine
There was a revival in the medicine during this
period.
William Harvey (English)
He discovered significant information regarding
the blood circulation system in the human body.
Paracelsus (Swiss)
He invented the telescope. He observed the
objects in the sky with the help of his telescope

obtained the assistance of these middle class
representatives in the administrative affairs. The
middle class gained the royal assistance for their
trade affairs.
Michael Certes (Swiss)
He discovered information on the process of
spreading blood throughout the body after being
purified by lungs after coming into it from the
heart and going out through the right side of the
heart.
Johannes Gutenberg (German)
The German national Johannes Gutenberg
invented the printing machine.
The Political Revival
During the feudal period ruling of each region
was assigned to provincial rulers. The land-
owning aristocrats acted as provincial rulers.
As they acted independently, they enjoyed more
powers than the king in the administrative
affairs. As the people then lived were under each
provincial ruler, they just thought of themselves
as the people of their own province but did not
act as one nation in one country.
The origination of national states during
the Renaissance was
the most significant
transformation experienced in the field of
politics. The separate provincial states were
united under one king. Therefore, the king
was significant in administrative affairs and all
powers centered on the king.
A middle class originated with the growth of trade
affairs in the12th century. The middle class was
those who became rich by earning money from
the trade by then. Traders, bankers, ship-owners,
and caravan owners belonged to the middle class.
When the middle class became more powerful in
the society, the land-owning aristocrats started
to lose the powers and the rights that they
enjoyed so far. The kings in the national states
Economic Revival
A broad transformation occurred in Europe
during the Renaissance. The self sufficient
economy in the mediaeval age declined and
a growth of trading happened in this period.
After the national states originated in Europe,
the governments extended their direct support
to widen the trade affairs. For that, national
trade policies and national tax policies were
implemented in the European countries. Further,
as a result of explorations, new sea routes were
discovered and it helped the Europeans to
travel to the East and the American continent.
Therefore, they could take the trade commodities
and items such as, spices, gold, silver, pearls,
gems, elephants, and tusks to Europe. Through
this their trading developed.
With the widening of trade affairs, the usage of
currency increased. Using monetary notes and
coins spread. As it was difficult and insecure in
taking money to distant areas for transactions,
exchange of cheques and banking system started
during the Renaissance. Further, the banks
supplied loan facilities to businessmen for their
commercial affairs.
Discovery of New Trade Routes
With the capture of the city of Constantinople
by the Turks in 1453 A.D, the trade affairs in the
East and West of the Europeans were disturbed.
All trade routes by sea and land came under the
Turks’ empire. Therefore, the Europeans tended
to find new sea routes to reach Asia to gain Asian
commodities.
By this time a conducive background to explore
new sea routes was setting in Europe. That is,
 The compass, which could be used for the
safety of navel journeys, had been invented.
 The fact that the world is round had been
discovered during the Renaissance.
 Proper understanding had been provided on
the world by Ptolemy’s world map.
 National states sponsored for this journey.
The first two countries which were interested
in the purpose of exploration were Portugal
and Spain. Prince Henry in Portugal (Henry
the Navigator) extended a huge support to the
explorative affairs.
Bertholamiudus who attempted to find a sea
route from Portugal to the East and was caught
in a tempest in the South cape in Africa, named it
the Tempest Cape and sailed back to his country.
Later the king of Portugal renamed it as Cape of
Good Luck.
Vasco de Gama, who sailed in the same route
travelled by Bertholamiudus, reached the Calicut
harbour in India. This was the first sea route to
Asia, discovered by the Europeans.
Christopher Columbus was able to discover
West Indies under the auspices of Ferdinand
and the queen Isabella in Spain. Amerigo
Vespuchi discovered America (The New World).
Ferdinand Magellan discovered Philippines and
Cabe brothers discovered Canada.
The Global Trend in the Renaissance
The Renaissance first started in the city of
Florence in Italy. Afterwards it spread in the
other regions in Italy and then throughout the
Europe. Europeans started travelling to discover
new countries as a result of the explorations in
the Renaissance. As a result of it, Europeans
spread their power in the Asian, African, and
American continents. Therefore, some countries
in the above mentioned continents were colonies
of several European countries for about four and
half centuries beginning from the 16th century.
Therefore, new relations developed with Europe
and other countries in the world commercially,
socially, culturally as well as politically. As a result
of these relations, printing industry spread over
the world. Through this, European thinking and
its literature spread in other countries. Sons and
daughters of the rich in the colonies migrated
to European countries for their education. The
Europeans propagated their religion in colonies
under them. Further, as a result of constructing
churches and other buildings in their colonies,
they received the architecture and arts and crafts
of the Europeans. Due to the relations between
the Europe and other countries the world
inherited scientific knowledge and technology
of Europe. By this, the Renaissance became a
global trend.
9.2 The Influence of the Renaissance on Sri
Lanka
The influence of the Renaissance, which took
place in Europe, reached Sri Lanka with the
arrival of Portuguese, Dutch and English nations.
Since the Kandyan kingdom was independent
during the period in which these nations ruled
in the coastal areas, they could not make a broad
change in the society of this country. However,
after the conquest of the Kandyan kingdom by
the British in 1815, Sri Lanka remained a colony
of the British until 1948. Therefore, a number
of broad transformations took place in this
country not only politically but also socially and
culturally during that time.
Political Changes
By the 19th century Europe had experienced a
broad thinking transformation as a result of the
Renaissance, religious reforms, advancement
in printing, rise of capitalism and industrial
revolution. Accordingly, we consider that the
transformations, which took place in this country
during the British ruling, occurred due to this
novel thinking. Though there was a traditional
system of king’s ruling until the Kandyan
kingdom was surrendered, that ruling system
ended after Sri Lanka became a colony. This
country received a parliamentary government
system due to governmental reforms introduced
by the English. During the British rule, the
then existed provincial ruling of this country
too underwent a change. They introduced a
new administrative system and a class of new
administrative officers instead of the traditional
leaders such as Adikarams, Disawes, Mohottalas,
and Koralas in the Kandyan kingdom. Further,
the ancient legal system which existed in this
country too went into disuse. During the Dutch
ruling, the Roman and Dutch law had also been
introduced to this country. During the British
ruling, they established a legal system, which
accorded with the fundamentals of the European
legal system, and a court system for justice in
this country.
Economic Changes
The cities close to the Mediterranean Sea such
as Venice, Genova, and Constantinople were
prominent in the European trade affairs during
the mediaeval period. However, after
Renaissance the countries close to the Atlantic
sea such as Portugal, Spain, France, Holland and
England were more important in the European
trade affairs.
With the arrival of European nations to this
country, direct trade relations started between
Sri Lanka and Europe. The Dutch cultivated
cinnamon in this country aiming at trading
and the British cultivated trade items such as
coffee, cocoa, cinchona, tea and rubber. As
this country got accustomed to a commercial
economic pattern under the Europeans, the
rural self sufficient economy, which had existed
so far in this country, collapsed. Due to the
economic reforms implemented by the English,
there started an import and export economy
in the country. As a result, even food items
were imported to Sri Lanka. Apart from this,
spreading the usage of money, starting a railway
and a road system, beginning of trade cities such
as Colombo, Galle and Trincomalee and a new
middle class which earned money from the new
means are examples for other transformations
which took place economically in this country.
Social and Cultural Transformations
The introduction of the printing industry to Sri
Lanka was another effect of the Renaissance to
this country. Though the printing industry was
first introduced to this country by the Dutch,
it became more popular during the British
ruling. With the advancement of the printing,
due to publication of books, magazines and
newspapers, the knowledge of the society
increased. Through that, this country inherited
the European thinking as well as its literature.
Some Sri Lankans migrated
to European
countries for education and returned to the
country. In this way too Sri Lanka acquired the
Western thinking.
Europeans came to Sri Lanka in a period in
which the unity of Christianity in Europe
had collapsed. The religious revolution which
took place in 1517 in Europe was the cause for
that. The Portuguese propagated the Roman
Catholic religion around coastal areas in this
country and the Dutch propagated their cult
in this country. Through this the religious sects
in Europe were propagated in this country. The
European education system was propagated in
this country due to the education which was
implemented in this country during the Dutch
and the British ruling; further, as the Europeans
constructed churches and other buildings in this
country, Sri Lanka received the architecture then
practised in Europe.

Activity
Explain how the Renaissance in Europe
influenced the political, economic and cultural
sections in Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka and the Western World
Introduction
The Europeans paid their attention to Eastern
countries as a result of the new revival in the
trade centred on the Southern Europe from
the beginning of the second millennium A.D.
The purpose of it was to use the resources in
those countries for trade.
Some specialties can be seen in the way
Sri Lanka, which had a long history in
connection with the trading in the Indian
Ocean, acted with the European nations. There
was a series of remonstrance in the relations
between Sri Lanka and the Western world in
this period since the political motives emerged
more than the commercial purposes. A series
of reactions between the remonstrances of
the natives against the domination of the
foreigners could be seen in this period. It is
expected to discuss those facts in this lesson.
10.1 Arrival of the Portuguese in Asia
There were three main routes through which
Asia and Europe continued their trade relations
from the distant past.
1. The Silk Route which led from the city of
Constantinople through Persia, the Central Asia
to China.
2. The route which led from Constantinople to
Egypt through the Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea
to the Indian Ocean.
3. The route which led from Constantinople
through Bagdad, the Persian Gulf to the Western
coast of India.
They used ships in the sea and the caravans on
land to transport the commodities when they
made their trade relations. By the mediaeval
period, the monopoly of trades in Asia was in the
hands of the Muslims. The Muslims made a great
profit by collecting the commodities including
spices in Asia and selling them to Europeans.
As all three trade routes above mentioned had
connected with the city of Constantinople, that
city which was under the European Christian
believers, had become the main centre of the
East and West trading. But, when this city was
captured by the Turks who followed the Islam
religion in 1453, it was a great blow to the
traditional trading between Asia and Europe.
The European Christians suffered a great loss,
due to the capture of the city of Constantinople
(present day Istanbul) by the Muslims. The
Muslims who captured the city created many
difficulties to the Europeans by increasing
the prices of Asian spices, creating a dearth of
commodities and not supplying the commodities
in time. As the Europeans had got used to
consume Asian spices for a long time, there was a
great demand for the spices including cinnamon
and pepper. The Europeans faced a challenge in
finding new routes to reach Asia since all the
aforementioned trade routes were under the
Islamic followers. In this effort, the Portuguese
acted as pioneers.
The motherland of the Portuguese was Portugal.
Portugal is a country situated in the Iberian
Peninsula in South-West Europe. And also
Portugal is located facing the Atlantic Ocean.
Therefore, the Portuguese had to run their
foreign relations through sea routes. As a result,
they showed a great competence in sea affairs
from the distant past. Prince Henry alias the
Henry the Navigator, who lived in Portugal in
Fig.10.1. The Dutch symbol which has been carved in an old building in Colombo.
the 15th century, was very interested in explorative
affairs.
He ran a naval school in Portugal and taught
subjects such as naval craft, mapping and
astronomy in that. Because of these reasons,
the Portuguese were in the forefront more than
other Europeans in the effort of finding a new sea
route to Asia. With the arrival of the Portuguese
national Vasco De Gama to Calicut in 1498
after travelling round Africa, the European
domination over Asia started. After the arrival
of the Portuguese to Asia, other Europeans such
as, the Dutch, the English, and the French too
arrived in Asia and spread their power over
various regions. Thus, the Europeans extended
their power over Asia for about 450 years from
the beginning of the 16th century.
The Europeans came to Asia with several
economic
objectives. Gaining
benefits,
propagating their religion and winning the
international reputation were major among them.
The objectives of the arrival of the Europeans to
Asia had differences according to the political
and economic changes that took place in Europe
during the period from the 16th century to the
20th century.
The major objectives of the arrival of the
Portuguese to Asia were gaining economic
benefits and propagating Roman Catholic
religion. Their purpose was to defeat the Muslims
and take over the trade monopoly in Asia since
the Muslims had the trade monopoly, when they
arrived in Asia. The Portuguese knew that they
could gain a huge profit by that. After the arrival
of Vasco De Gama to Calicut, the statement
they made that “we arrived here in search of
the Christians and spices” clearly shows their
economic and religious purposes. The second
Portuguese group, who came to India after
Vasco De Gama, had been given instructions
by Portugal to establish a store house for storing
commodities and to get permission from the
ruler of Calicut for five priests to come and preach
sermons. This clearly shows that the Portuguese
had the purpose of propagating their religion in
the areas where they would spread their power.
10.2 The Political Condition in Sri Lanka
when the Portuguese arrived in Sri Lanka
There was
and military
commercial
importance to Sri Lanka in the Asian affairs of
the Europeans as Sri Lanka was a significant
centre situated close to the sea trade routes in
the Indian Ocean. The Portuguese, who had
recognized this country as Seilan, knew that this
country produced cinnamon of good standard.
Therefore, the Portuguese paid their attention
to Sri Lanka within a short time period after
they had come to India. In the month of March
in1505, the king of Portugal sent Francisco De
Almeida appointing him as the viceroy in East.
Finding Seilan (Sri Lanka) was one among the
instructions that had been given to Almeida by
the Portuguese ruler. His purpose was achieved
when Lorenzo De Almeida, a son of Francisco
De Almeida, reached this country accidentally
after being caught in a tempest.
in 1505,
When Lorenzo De Almeida arrived in this
there was a conducive
country
background set for a foreign invasion as there
was not a political unity in Sri Lanka. Though
king Parakramabahu VI had united the country
and created a political stability by establishing
Kotte Kingdom, that unity collapsed after a
certain time of his demise. Therefore, when
the Portuguese arrived, there were two more
kingdoms named Udarata and Jaffna in addition
to Kotte kingdom. The Portuguese, who came
to Sri Lanka, first built their relationships
with the kingdom of Kotte. It is said that
when the Portuguese came to Colombo, their
representatives were accompanied to meet the
king through a road consisted of many bends.
This tact was used by the representatives of the
king in order to pretend them that there was a
great distance between Colombo and Kotte.
With this incident a proverb has come into
usage as “Parangiya Kotte Giya Wage” (like the
Portuguese went to Kotte).
The division of the kingdom of Kotte, which was
the largest kingdom when the Portuguese arrived
in this country, into three parts with the incident
called ‘Vijayaba Kollaya’ which took place in
1521, made easy for the Portuguese to spread
their power. After King Veera Parakaramabahu
VIII, one of his sons, prince Vijayabahu VI
became the king. King Vijayabahu had three
sons named respectively prince Buvanekabahu,
prince Mayadunne and prince Rayigam Bandara
from his first marriage. A conflict arose as there
was an attempt to confer the future kingship
to another prince called Devaraja without
conferring it to three prince-brothers. The three
princes heard that they were going to lose the
inheritance of kingship. Then they attempted to
capture the ruling power by coming to Kotte after
taking support from the then ruler of Udarata,
King Jayaweera Bandara. In this attempt a
person called Salman killed king Vijayabahu.
This incident, which occurred in attempting to
usurp the ruling power from king Vijayabahu
VI in 1521, is known as the ‘Vijayaba Kollaya’.
After the ‘Vijayaba Kollaya’ incident, the three
kings divided the kingdom of Kotte into three
parts amomg them and ruled. Accordingly,
Buvanekabahu VII came into power as the ruler
of Kotte. Prince Mayadunne was the ruler of
Seethawaka area and prince Rayigam Bandara
was the ruler of Rayigama area. In this way, when
the kingdom of Kotte was divided into three
parts, it provided the Portuguese, who were
expecting to spread their power in this country,
a great advantage.
Expansion of the Portuguese Power in the
Coastal Areas in Sri Lanka
Before long after the division of Kotte kingdom
into three parts, disputes started between king
Buvanekabahu VII and king Mayadunne. The
issues regarding the inheritance of future kingship
of Kotte and attempting to take over several areas,
which belonged to the Kotte kingdom, by king
Mayadunne were the causes for these disputes.
Though king Buvanekabahu had a daughter
named Samudradevi, he did not have a son to be
conferred the future kingship of Kotte. Veediya
Bandara, who was known as a great warrior at
that time, had married Princess Samudradevi
and they had two sons named Vijayapala and
Dharmapala. King Buvanekabahu’s expectation
was to confer the future kingship to his daughter’s
son prince Dharmapala. King Mayadunne, who
had future expectations to be the king of Kotte,
did not like this decision of king Buvanekabahu
at all. King Mayadunne, who played a major
role in the incident of ‘Vijayaba Kollaya’ was a
great warrior and he had the ability to get the
support of king Jayaweera Bandara, who was
the ruler of Udarata. King Buvanekabahu, who
had feared of an attack on the Kotte kingdom
from king Mayadunne, called the Portuguese
for his protection. As a result of the disputes
between the kingdoms Kotte and Seethawaka,
the Portuguese, who entered the capital as the
protectors in this way, implemented a tactful
campaign to extend their power by intervening
in all affairs of the kingdom.
Since there was a competition for trading between
the Portuguese and the Muslims, the Muslims did
not wish to see the construction of fortresses by
the Portuguese in this country. The Portuguese,
who took the maximum advantage from the given
opportunity, persuaded king Buvanekabahu to
take actions against the Muslims in the kingdom
of Kotte. Therefore, the Muslims, who lived in
the coastal areas, supported king Mayadunne.
At the request of the Sri Lankan Muslims,
Samorin, the ruler of Calicut in India offered to
provide the naval support to king Mayadunne to
attack the Portuguese. Though king Mayadunne
launched several attacks against the Portugese
with the support of Samorin, those attacks were
not successful due to the naval power and their
weaponry power.
There were several fights between Kotte and
Seethawaka kingdoms when king Buvanekabahu
was alive. In these conflicts, the Portuguese
fought for the protection of the Kotte kingdom
and the military expenses of the Portuguese had
to be paid by the king. Though king Buvakebahu
gained the support of the Portuguese, he did
not act as a puppet-ruler of them. Though the
Portuguese attempted to convert the king to
Roman Catholic religion, the king refused it.
Therefore, with time disputes between the king
and the Portuguese aggravated. Apart from
religious reasons, some economic reasons such
as, selling their commodities at a very high price
to the people in Kotte by the Portuguese and
buying Kotte products at a very low price too
affected. These disagreements ended when king
Buvanekabahu was shot dead by a Portuguese
soldier. As it was reported by the author named
Kutho, the king’s assassination occurred on 29th
December 1550.
When king Buvanekabahu was alive, he made
a statue of prince Dharmapala, his grandson,
and sent it to Portugal for coronation. By doing
that the king Buvanekabahu had provided
him necessary protection. Therefore, after
the demise of king Buvanekabahu, prince
Dharmapala became the ruler of Kotte amidst
the protection of the Portuguese. Since king
Dharmapala became a puppet-ruler under the
Portuguese, embraced Catholic religion, allowed
the Portuguese to propagate their religion in
his kingdom, did not take action to prevent the
harassments and injustices done to his people
in Kotte by the Portuguese, the king did not get
the support of the people. Therefore, even the
sacred Tooth Relic was taken to Seethawaka for
its protection. Though king Dharamapala was
on the throne from 1551 to 1597 as a nominal
king, the Portuguese was the real rulers in
the kingdom of Kotte. As king Dharamapala
assigned his kingship to the Portuguese from a
deed of gift, the Portuguese had a legal right to
rule Kotte after the king’s death.
Veediye Bandara
Veediye Bandara, who had married Princess
Samudradevi, who was the daughter of king
Buvanekabahu, was a great warrior. During the
very beginning of the ruling of king Dharmapala,
his son, he arose against the Portuguese due to
looting of the Kotte palace and various injustices
done to Kotte people by the Portuguese.
Therefore, he was arrested and imprisoned in
the Colombo fort by the Portuguese. But, the
wife of Veediye Bandara made a tunnel which
led to the cell where he was detained and freed
him. Afterwards he fled to Pelenda area in Pas
Yodun Koralaya and started a fight against the
Portuguese by building a fort there. The people of
Kotte, who were despondent of the Portuguese,
supported Veediye Bandara. The Portuguese
suffered many losses due to the attacks of Veediye
Bandara. Further, Veediye Bandara’s actions were
a great nuisance to the rulers of Seethawaka.
Therefore, king Mayadunne and the Portuguese
combined and invaded the fort of Pelenda and
defeated Veediye Bandara. Veediye Bandara,
who had fled to Kanda Udarata afterwards, was
killed in a conflict later in Jaffna.
Kingdom of Seethawaka
Mayadunne, who was the ruler of Seethawaka,
continued a policy against the Portuguese from
the very beginning of that kingdom. When
the power of the Portuguese developed in the
kingdom of Kotte, king Mayadunnne tended to
fight both with the Portuguese and the rulers of
Kotte. Therefore, the attacks of Mayadunne were
increased after king Dharmapala became the
ruler of Kotte. As prince Tikiri Bandara, the son
of king Mayadunne offered to give the leadership
to the Seethawaka army as a great warrior, the
army was more strengthened in about 1555. In
1557 Mayadunne launched an attack on the city
of Kotte using all his power. But the Seethawaka
army could not enter the city due to the attacks
of the artillery guns of the Portuguese. Later
Mayadunne followed a policy of attacking the
areas away from Kotte from time to time.
The Seethawaka rulers, who abstained from
massive attacks after the unsuccessful effort
of besieging and attacking the city of Kotte,
launched an onset to attack both Kotte and
Colombo fort at once. In this, there was a
horrendous fight between the Sinhala army led
by prince Tikiri and the Portuguese in the paddy
field in Mulleriyawa. The Portuguese suffered
a debacle in this fight which lasted for a whole
day. It is reported that around 1600 Portuguese
soldiers were killed in this fight. This is one of the
biggest battle losses of Portuguese in an Asian
country.
Due to the occasional attacks from Seethawaka
on the city of Kotte, King Dharmapala abandoned
the city and shifted to the Colombo fort around
1565. And also, in about 1581 king Mayadunne
died and prince Tikiri acceded to the throne
of Seethawaka in the name of ‘Rajasighe’. No
sooner he became the king, he repulsed the
then ruler of Kandy, Karaliyedde Bandara, and
annexed the Kandyan kingdom to Seethawaka.
Accordingly, king Rajasinghe was able to confine
the Portuguese power to the Colombo fort and
a few other areas by about 1582. Therefore,
many areas of the Kotte kingdom, kingdom of
Rayigama and the whole Kandyan kingdom
were under the Seethawaka kingdom.
King Rajasinghe attempted to besiege and
repulse the Portuguese from this country twice.
But, king’s effort was unsuccessful due to the
weaponry power of the Portuguese and the
support they had from Gowa, which was the
east headquarters of the Portuguese. Though
in 1587 king Rajasinghe attempted to enter the
Colombo fort by digging a canal to send the
water of Bere tank to the sea in his second siege,
it too was abortive. One of the reasons for these
fights to be unsuccessful was that Seethawaka
kingdom did not have adequate naval strength.
King Rajasinghe, who was on a constant battle
with the Portuguese, died of being wounded
by pricking a bamboo thorn in the Pethangoda
garden on his way back to Seethawaka after
being defeated in a battle with the king of the
Kandyan kingdom, Wimaladharmasooriya.
Afterwards, the kingdom Seethawaka collapsed.
There were many reasons that caused the collapse
of the Seethawaka kingdom; engaging of the
Seethawaka rulers in a constant battle, following
anti-Buddhist policy by king Rajasinghe in his
later time, killing Veerasundara Bandara, who
assisted King Rajasinghe to surrender the Kadyan
kingdom and therefore, getting less support from
the Kandyans, acceding of Konappu Bandara,
who was the son of Veerasundara Bandara, to
the Kandyan throne, having no proper heir to
the Seethawaka kingdom were some of them.
However, the attempt of the Portuguese to
extend their power in this country was limited
due to the patriotic fight against the Portuguese
by the Seethawaka rulers.
The Portuguese, who become stronger again
during the period of decline of Seethawaka
kingdom, established their power in many
coastal areas in this country by capturing the
areas of the kingdoms of Kotte and Rayigama and
some of the areas which were under Seethawaka
after the collapse of Seethawaka.
Jaffna Kingdom
The Jaffna kingdom, which started after the
downfall of Rajarata civilization, was ruled
by a dynasty called Arya Chakrawarthi. King
Pararajasekaram, who belonged to that dynasty,
was ruling Jaffna during the period in which the
Portuguese came to this country. The Portuguese
did not pay much attention to Jaffna during the
first decade after their arrival to this country
because Jaffna did not produce trade items
such as cinnamon and pepper. In 1519 a prince
named Sankili captured the power of Jaffna and
ruled the area until 1561.
There started conflicts between King Sankili and
the Portuguese because the trading ships of the
Portuguese were disturbed and the king acted
against their attempt to spread Catholic religion
in the areas in Jaffna during the king Sankili’s
ruling period. Accordingly, the Portuguese
invaded Jaffna against the king in 1543. But, the
battle was prevented as king Sankili agreed to pay
the ransom without going to a battle with them.
After coming to a peaceful agreement with the
ruler of Jaffna, the Portuguese acted to propagate
Catholic religion in the areas of Jaffna. As the
Hindu priests rose against this, king Sankili
disturbed the Portuguese affairs of propagating
their religion in the Mannar area. King Sankili
went to the area of Mannar with his army and
ordered all the people, who had embraced
Catholic religion, to embrace their traditional
religion. He administered severe punishments
to those who did not obey his order. As it was
an impediment to spread Catholic religion in
Mannar area, the Missionary priests requested
the Portuguese to dethrone the Jaffna ruler.
Therefore, king Sankili came to an alliance with
Seethawaka Mayadunne in 1548. When Veedeye
Bandara, who was an anti-Portuguese, fled to
Jaffna, king Sankili welcomed him. But nothing
of these was successful.
In 1560 the Portuguese invaded Jaffna again,
king Sankili had to abandon the capital and flee.
Afterwards, though he protected his power once
again on the strict conditions of the Portuguese,
at this time the Portuguese captured Mannar and
built a fortress there. The deprivation of Jaffna
was a great loss to the Jaffna ruler. As a result of it,
he not only lost a considerable land, but also the
income that Jaffna received by diving for pearls
in the Mannar area. Further, the Portuguese
had the opportunity to intervene in the political
affairs of Jaffna from Mannar.
In 1561 a prince named Puvirajapandaram
dethroned king Sankili and captured the power.
Hereafter, a struggle started among the heirs for
the throne of Jaffna. In this effort, since some
sought the assistance of the Portuguese, the
Portuguese could bring those who were in favour
of the Portuguese to power. Even some of those
rulers acted against the Portuguese when they
had the opportunity, the Portuguese invaded
Jaffna once again and appointed a person called
Edirimannasinham, who was loyal to them, to
the throne of Jaffna. Though he ruled obediently
to the Portuguese, several times he allowed king
Senarath, who was the ruler of the Kandyan
kingdom, to maintain trade relations with South
India through Jaffna sea. With the death of the
Jaffna ruler in 1617, once again power-struggles
started. As a result of it, one prince Sankili
Kumara, who was a member of the royal family,
captured the power. The Portuguese never
tolerated the occasional supports of the Jaffna
rulers to the Kandyan king for his trade affairs
and his relations with South India. Accordingly,
a Portuguese army under the leadership of Philip
De Olivera seized Jaffna in 1621. Afterwards,
though there were some rebellions against the
Portuguese, the Portuguese suppressed them
and established their power by in Jaffna 1621.
The following facts caused the collapse of the
Jaffna kingdom; the division of Jaffna people due
to the power-struggles of the heirs to the throne
of Jaffna, there was not an adequate army for its
rulers, and Jaffna was not naturally protected as
the Kandyan kingdom.
The Attempts of the Portuguese to expand
Their Power in the Kandyan Kingdom
Since the Portuguese had spread their power
in many parts of the low-country after the
collapse of Seethawaka kingdom, the Kandyan
kingdom was held responsible of protecting
the independence of the country. The Kandyan
kingdom was able to keep that responsibility by
facing various challenges from the Portuguese,
Dutch and the English until 1815. Here, let’s
consider the attempts of the Portuguese to extend
their power in the areas in Kandy and the actions
that the Kandyan people took against them.
The attempts to extend their power in the
Kandyan kingdom alias Udarata kingdom was
started by the Portuguese during the same time
in which they were interfering in the political
affairs of Kotte. We described in the eighth
chapter how the Portuguese attempted to spread
their power in the Kandyan kingdom even before
king Wimaladharmasooriya came to power in
the kingdom.
The Battle of Danthure
The Potuguese was never pleased with acceding
Konappu Bandara, who was well aware of
warfare and other strategies of the Portuguese
by staying under them for a certain period of
time, to the throne of Kandyan kingdom in the
name of Vimaladharmasooriya I. Therefore,
the Portuguese attempted
to accompany
Kusumasana Devi (Dona Kathirina), who
was in the care of the Portuguese and was the
daughter of Karaliyadde Bandara, to Kandy
and bring her to power. By doing this they tried
to establish a ruling which was loyal to them.
In the invasion made under the leadership of
Captain General Gero Lopes De Susa, they
made Kusumasana Devi the queen of Kandy in
1594. But the Kandyans, who hesitated to accept
one appointed by the foreigners as the queen,
supported the king Vimaladharmasooriya I.
Pero Lopes De Susa had to withdraw with his
army. In October in 1594 there was a great battle
between the Portuguese army and the Kandyans.
The whole Portuguese battalion was destroyed
in this battle and even Pero Lopes De Susa, who
led this invasion, too was killed. Kusumasana
Devi was arrested by the Kandyans in the battle
and afterwards king Vimaladharmasooriya I
wedded her. As a result of this marriage, a new
dynasty started in Kandy. The attempts, which
the Portuguese made to establish a ruling which
was loyal to them, were unsuccessful with a
great debacle. Military manoeuvres of king
Vimaladharmasooriya I, support of the Kandyans
to the king, and rejoining the army, which went
from low country to assist the Portuguese, to
the king in Kandy caused the victory of king
Vimaladharmasooriya I.
The Battle of Balana
After the death of Pero Lopes De Susa, Don
Geranimo De Asavedu was sent here by making
him the Captain General by the Portuguese.
With the defeat of the Portuguese in Danthure,
a rebellion sprang in the areas in the low country
under the leadership of Edirille Rala. King
Vimaladharmasooriya I supported this rebellion.
Therefore, the Portuguese defeated the rebels by
killing the leaders of the rebellion and setting fire
to the villages and property. Afterwards Asavedu
prepared for a battle with Kandy. In 1602 Asavedu,
who brought an additional army from Gowa,
invaded Kandy with a battalion of thousand
soldiers. But the Portuguese army reached only
the Balana pass. In this place, the Kandyans,
who besieged the Portuguese in accordance with
a manoeuvre of king Vimaladharmasooriya I,
launched a horrendous attack on the Portuguese.
The people from the low-country who had
gone to support the Portuguese, joined the
king’s party at this time too. A considerable
number of Portuguese soldiers were killed due
to the attack of the Kandyans and their weapons
were arrested by the Kandyans. With this
defeat Asavedu withdrew to Colombo through
Malwana. After the unsuccessful invasion of
Asavedu, the Portuguese followed a policy of
attacking the Kandyans and their villages from
time to time instead of invading Kandy using
a big army. Therefore, king Senarath, who
became the Kandyan ruler after the death of
king Vimaladharmasooriya, entered into a peace
agreement with the Portuguese in 1617. But it
did not work properly.
The Battle of Randeniwala
As the Portuguese Captain General Constantinu
De Sa invaded Kandy via Uva area, the Battle
of Randeniwala started. Constantinu De Sa led
this invasion with about 600 Portuguese soldiers
and another battalion of about 4500 mercenary
army in the month of July 1630. The Portuguese
captured the city of Badulla and destroyed it. The
Kandyan king Senarath had come to Badulla with
his army and started attacking the Portuguese.
Prince Maha Asthana (later he became the king
of Kandy in the name of Rajasinghe II), who was
a son of king Senarath, provided the leadership
to the Kandyan army. When the Kandyan army
besieged the Portuguese, the Mudalis who
had gone from the low country to support the
Portuguese, rejoined the king. As a result of
this, the Kandyan army became stronger and
the Portuguese was helpless due to the attacks
of the Kandyans. Therefore they withdrew to
Randeniwala which was close to Wellawaya. In
this the Kandyans encircled the Portuguese and
attacked them resulting in killing about 350
Portuguese soldiers. Another group of soldiers
were arrested. Even Captain General Constantinu
De Sa was killed in the battle. This invasion was
not done suddenly by the Portuguese. They had
planned it for about two years. But all the plans
of the Portuguese went awry in the face of the
manoeuvres of the Kandyans.
The Battle of Gannoruwa
In the month of March in 1638, Kandy was once
again invaded by the then Captain General Diago
De Melo in Sri Lanka. The Portuguese, who went
with about one thousand of the Portuguese
soldiers and other thousands of mercenary
soldiers, entered the city of Kandy without any
difficulty. King Rajasinghe, who had come to
the throne after king Senarath, abandoned the
city tactically. Afterwards, the Kandyan army
encircled the Portuguese at the right time.
There was a horrendous battle between the two
parties in Gannoruwa. However, the Portuguese
Map 10.1 The distribution of the Dutch Fortresses in Sri Lanka.
suffered a debacle in this battle too due the usual
attacks of the Kandyans. Even Diago De Melo,
who led the battle, was killed. There are records
about the number of the Portuguese soldiers left.
Everyone of them mentions that only less than
one hundred Portuguese soldiers were left. And
also, it was the last invasion of the Portuguese led
to capture the Kandyan kingdom.
There are reasons which affected the failure of
the invasions of the Portuguese and protection
of the Kandyan kingdom further.
• The frequent support of the Kandyan people
to the king.
• The people from low - country, who went
to support the Portuguese in the invasions,
rejoined the king.
• The warfare of the Kandyan people and the
strategies of the kings.
• The natural

10.3 Sri Lanka and the Dutch
Holland is the motherland of the Dutch. After
about a century of the Portuguese arrival to Asia,
the Dutch started to come to Asia by finding the
sea routes of the Portuguese. In early period,
various trade companies in Holland had come to
Asia and since there was a competition among
the Holland trade companies, the Dutch could
not establish a strong power in Asia. Therefore,
in 1602 several Holland companies got together
and established East Holland Trade Company
alias VOC Company. From then on the political
and commercial affairs in Asia for the Dutch
were conducted by the VOC Company. As the
prime purpose of a trade company is to make
profits, it is clear that the main objective of the
Dutch to come to Asia was to gain economic
benefits.
The Dutch, who came to Asia, made their centre
in Batavia on the Island of Java and started their
power in the east. Before long after the arrival
of the Dutch to Asia, they paid their attention
to Sri Lanka, which had trade items such as,
cinnamon and pepper of good standard. As the
kings of Kandy, who were suffering from the
struggles from the Portuguese, wished to build
relations with the Dutch, they could know more
information about Sri Lanka by coming to this
country.
In 1602, Jorris Van Spilbergeon, a representative
of the Dutch came to Sri Lanka and met king
Wimaladharmasooriya I. Afterwards another
representative named Sibil De Vert came. But
these missions did not give any successful
results. The successful relationships were
started between the Dutch and the Kandyan
rulers during the time of king Rajasinghe II.
The purpose of king Rajasinghe II was to expel
the Portuguese from this country because they
always fought with Kandy. Since he did not have
enough naval power to do that, he thought of
getting assistance of the Dutch.
As a result of the letters which exchanged
between king Rajasinghe II and the Dutch and
the missions, the Dutch agreed to assist to expel
the Portuguese from the country. According to an
agreement between the Lankan representatives
and the Dutch naval commanding officer
Westworld, both sides got together and attacked
the Portuguese fort in Batticaloa in 1638. But,
the Portuguese in the fort surrendered before
it turned to be a disastrous battle. Therefore,
king Rajasinghe II, who was overjoyed with this,
entered into a bond with the Dutch.

Fig: 10.2 The meeting between the Kandyan leaders and the Dutch.
It took 20 more years to expel the Portuguese
from the country since the seizure of the
Batticaloa fort in 1638. During this time the
the Portuguese forts in Trincomalee, Negambo,
Galle, Kalutara, Colombo, Mannar and Jaffna
were captured by the Dutch and the Sri Lankan
army. Thus, this combination was able to expel the
Portuguese from Sri Lanka by 1658. According
to the bond signed between the king and the
Dutch, occupying the Dutch army in the forts
captured from the Portuguese should have been
done according to the king’s agreement. But, the
Dutch, who forgot that sentence in the bond,
avoided handing over the forts which located in
the areas advantageous for them. Therefore, this
damaged the goodwill between the king and the
Dutch.
King Rajasinghe II brought the Dutch to this
country in order to achieve two objectives.
1. Expelling the Portuguese from Sri Lanka with
the support of the Dutch.
2. Making Sri Lanka an independent and free
country by annexing the areas which were
under the Portuguese.
Though the king was able to achieve the first
objective out of these two, he could not achieve
the second one as the Dutch had spread their
power in many areas which were saved from the
Portuguese. Therefore, the king implemented a
strategy by attacking the Dutch and minimizing
the number of areas that they could take. Due to
this strategy of the king, by 1658 the Dutch was
able to gain only a lesser quantity of land than
the Portuguese had possessed.
King Rajasinghe II was one who gave a new
significance to the Kandyan kingdom after king
Vimaladharmasooriya I. The king claimed that
he was the emperor of Sri Lanka in exchanging
letters with the Dutch. The Dutch too had
accepted the king as “Thrisinhaladeeshvara”
even nominally in such exchange of letters.
When the king wrote letters to the Dutch he
used the phrases such as “ Mata Hithawath
Landesi Jathiya (Dear Dutch who serve me)”
and the Dutch too used the phrases such as “
Oba Vahanseta Suvacha Keekaru Sevaka (the
most obedient servant to you, Lord)” when
they wrote to the king. The Dutch launched a
series of attacks and seized several areas that
belonged to the Kandyan kingdom during the
time between 1665 and 1668. But due to a series
of attacks launched by king Rajasinghe II during
the period between 1670 and 1675, the Dutch
lost a number of areas that they had possessed.
Therefore, the Dutch, who realized that fighting
with the Kandyans would cause their destruction,
attempted to avoid fighting with the Kandyans
for about a hundred of years after 1670.

■ The Dutch’s policy of getting maximum
economic benefits
I. The Dutch impeded the king’s relations with
the other foreigners as much as possible.
II. Closing the city boundaries between up
country and low country when disputes started
with the king.
III. The Dutch tried to develop the paddy
cultivation in some of the areas in the low
country. By doing this, the Dutch expected to
minimize their expenses to import rice from
foreign countries.
IV. Getting people to grow cinnamon and taking
action to preserve cinnamon cultivation. The
Dutch implemented this policy because they
could make a huge profit from selling cinnamon.
V. The Dutch took steps to grow sugar cane,
coffee and cotton etc, which brought them
profits.
The Conflicts between the Kandyan Kingdom
and the Dutch
low-country people, who had been
oppressed until then by the time of King Keerthi
Sri Rajasinghe, requested the Kandyan king to
intervene for them. In latter part of 1760 the
rebellions arose against the Dutch in Negambo
and Matara. The king sent an army to the low
country area and the army made several instant
attacks and captured several places including
Katuwana fort and Matara fort. Later, the Dutch
recaptured these places.
In 1764 the Dutch invaded Kandy using 6
brigades led by the Dutch governor Barron
Van Ek. But none of these brigades could reach
Kandy. The Kandyans defeated these brigades
launching their usual attacks.
In 1765 the Dutch invaded Kandy once again.
The Dutch managed to enter the city of Kandy
by facing the attacks of the Kandyans. As king
Keerthi Sri Rajasinghe agreed to have a peaceful
condition, the Dutch presented a series of
conditions advantageous for them. But the
king did not like to accept the unreasonable
conditions of the Dutch. As a result, the Dutch,
who robbed the city, stayed there more than one
month. But, they abandoned Kandy and went
back to Colombo because of the lack of food,
diseases, and rainy season.
Due to the invasion, threats of the Dutch and
the suffering of people from the prolonged war
for years king Keerthi Sri Rajasinghe signed a
peace pact with the Dutch in 1766. The Kandyan
kingdom lost one coastal area due to the peace
pact. This was a blow to the traditional trading
in Kandy. The pact acknowledged the Dutch’s
righ to the areas which they had possessed in Sri
Lanka. A number of sentences in the peace pact
gave more advantages to the Dutch. Therefore,
though the Kandyans held some discussions to
make the pact lenient, the Dutch did not agree
with it. Finally, the Kandyans tended not to make
it work practically.
