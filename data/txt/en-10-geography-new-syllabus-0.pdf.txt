The Composition of the Earth
1
The earth occupies a unique place among the planets in the solar system as it is
the only planet which sustains life. The reasons for the existence of life are the
availability of air, water and solar energy.
The objective of this lesson is to examine in detail the
composition of the earth which is our habitat.
Composition of the Earth
The area of the surface of the Earth is about 510 million square km
(www.universetoday.com) and it is considered a very large system.
The earth system is composed of four sub systems. (Figure 1.1) They are the,

² The water in the hydrosphere is added to the atmosphere through evaporation.
² That water falls again to the earth as precipitation.
² The bio-environment in the biosphere is composed of soil, air and water.

The components of the bio-environment, has impacts on the
hydrosphere, atmosphere and lithosphere.
Lithosphere
Lithosphere is the layer that
includes the Earth’s crust and
the upper mantle. Continents
and oceans are located in the
lithosphere.
The lithosphere consists of two
parts according to its structure.

The lithosphere is the home for living beings. Most of the human activities
occur here. The living and non living resources which are found in the lithosphere
are utilized to fulfil human needs.
When the resources found in the lithosphere are utilized by man, the lithosphere is
affected in various ways. Examples of such effects are shown below.
² The occurence of land degradation due to excavation of land to obtain mineral
²
resources.
Intensification of soil erosion as a result of exposure of land due to clearing
of forests .
² Changes seen in the surface landscape.
² Changes in the ground water level.
² Damage to certain layers of the lithosphere as a result of disposal of domestic
and industrial waste.

Atmosphere
The atmosphere is the thin blanket of air around the earth that consists of various
gases. The atmosphere is held by the earth due to its gravitational pull. The most
important layer of the atmosphere is the area that extends up to 120km from the
surface of the earth. 50% of the total air content of the atmosphere is present in the
region that extends up to 5-6km from the earth’s surface. (David Waugh-2000)
The atmosphere is immensely important for the existence of living beings and
plant life as it provides oxygen for respiration of living beings and the necessary
carbon dioxide for the process of photosynthesis.

Hydrosphere
The entire body of water on the
surface of the earth in various forms
is termed the hydrosphere. The total
volume of water on earth is calculated
as 1386 million cubic kilometers
(Environmental Geography 1996).
Water is essential for the sustenance
of all the bio systems. Water is utilized
for drinking and domestic purposes as
well as for agricultural, industrial and
transportation activities.

At present, the quality of water is deteriorating due to the impact of various human
activities.
Some of the examples are,
² Addition and release of various chemicals and carbonic matter into the water
used and released by industries.
² The mixing of fertilizers and chemicals added to soil in agricultural activities
with the water.
² Addition of bacteria to ground water and surface water on the land as a result
of the irregular disposal of waste matter and sewage.

The Water Cycle
²
The continuous process by which water is circulated throughout the earth
and the atmosphere through evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and the
transpiration of plants is known as the water cycle.(Figure 1.7)
² The atmosphere gets the water that is evaporated from the surface of the
land and water bodies and also the water transpired from plants. This water
which exists as water vapour in the atmosphere is subjected to condensation
and returns to the earth as rainfall through the process of precipitetion.
² A part of the water received on the surface of the earth flows as surface runoff
and another part of it is infiltrated into the land. The infiltrated water is stored
in the earth as ground water and the springs and wells are fed by this infiltrated
water.

In the hydrosphere - The ocean bed in which sufficient amount of sunlight
penetrates for the process of photosynthesis.
In the atmosphere - The limits where birds fly (Approximately about
5000 m in the upper sky).
The process of photosynthesis which is necessary for the existence of man occurs
in the biosphere . A process of interaction between plant and animal life is visible in
the biosphere. Hence, plant life cannot exist without animals and animals cannot
live without plants. At present, most of the human activities have become a
strong threat to the biosphere. Accordingly, the equilibrium of the biosphere has
been disturbed due to these human activities. For example, the loss of animal
habitats due to the destruction of forests, destruction of the bio-systems,
erosion of the surface soil and infertility of soil.

The Major Physical
2
Characteristics of the Earth
Climate and relief are the major physical characteristics of the Earth. Relief
is the variety of the physical features found on the Earth. The Earth consists of
various physical features and a large number of such features are seen on the
Earth. Hills, mountains, mountain ranges, plateaus and plains are examples of such
features. Similarly, there is a variety of climatic conditions on the Earth.
The objective of this lesson is to study the relief, the nature of the main
types of climate and their distribution on the Earth.
The landforms or physical features of the Earth differ from each other in magnitude.
The largest features according to magnitude are the continents and oceans. Within
these large landform features, there are a number of smaller features.
Continents
Land covers 29% of the total area of the Earth. These lands are located as either
continents or islands. The large land masses which have risen from oceans are
called continents. There are seven such continents in the world. Table 2.1 below
includes information about the magnitude of those continents.

from
The shallow sea strip that stretches
the
the ocean
towards
continental boundary is known as
the continental shelf. A continental
shelf is not seen at the boundary of
every continent. The edge of the
continental shelf slopes abruptly
towards the ocean and it is called
the continental slope.
Islands

Islands are small land areas of various shapes surrounded by water. Many islands
are located in the continental shelf close to continents.
For example :-
²
²
Islands located in the continental shelf of Asia - Borneo, Java, Sumatra and
Sri Lanka
Islands located in the continental shelf of Australia - Papua New Guinea and
Tasmania
² An Island located in the continental shelf of Africa - Madagascar
When observing a world map or a model globe you would be able to identify islands
located in the central regions of the oceans too. The islands of Hawaii and Iceland
which were created as a result of volcanic activities that occurred in the deep
ocean are examples for that.
Activities
1. What is a continental shelf ? What is a continental slope? Explain with the
help of a diagram.
2. Mark and name ten islands of different sizes in a world map and five islands
that belong to Sri Lanka in a map of Sri Lanka.
Assignments
1. Identify the islands of the world with the help of an Atlas and prepare a list.
2. Tabulate the advantages and disadvantages of a country being an island.

Mountain ranges
The mountain ranges are landform features
that stretch with a higher elevation having a
variety of slopes and several peaks. When
several mountains are distributed in a
large region it is called a mountain range
system. Himalaya, Rockies and Andes are
examples of large mountain systems. Map

Plains
The flat lands extending in a very large area at a low elevation are called plains.
The Great Siberian plain, North American plain and Nullabar plain in Australia
are some examples for plains. (See map 2.3). Sometimes, these plains may show
a slightly undulating nature. These plains have been used for various human
activities more than higher mountainous areas. These plains are called by specific
names according to their formation or location. Coastal plain, glacier plain, fluvial
plain and alluvial plain are examples.

Rivers
A river is a natural water resource flowing throughout the year along a clear cut
valley into an ocean, a sea, a lake, a basin or a marsh. A river originates from a high
area and flows according to the gradient of the land. A few major rivers in the world
are shown in map 2.4. The source of a river may vary. Some rivers originate from
mountainous areas while some other rivers may originate from a spring or a lake.
Examples for such rivers
River Thames - From a spring
River Nile - From a lake
River Rhine - From melted glaciers
River Mahaweli - From a spring in a
mountainous area
Lakes

A depression (a crater) located on land which is filled with fresh water is
known as a lake. Lakes are located in almost all the continents in the world.
Lake Baikal in Asia, The Five Great Lakes in North America, Lake Ayre in
Australia, Lake Ladoga in Europe, Lake Titicaca in South America and Lake
Victoria in Africa are examples. Certain lakes are large water bodies filled
with salt water and they are considered as inland seas. Lake Superior is the
largest lake in the world while Lake Titicaca is located at the highest elevation.
Map 2.4 shows several lakes in the world.
Activities
1. Mark and name ten rivers and five lakes on a world map. (Select lakes and
rivers from all the continents except Antarctica).
2. Explain with examples how rivers and lakes become important in human
activities.
Assignment
Study map 2.4 and prepare a list of rivers and lakes according to their
location in each continent.

Distribution of the climatic types and their basic features
Climate is the general condition of the atmosphere that prevails within a long
period of time. Data on weather conditions for a period of at least 30-35 years
should be studied to get a clear idea about this generalized condition.
Various types of climates in the world have been identified according to different
climatic conditions that prevail in different geographical regions within a long
period of time. A particular type of climate is determined by some important
factors such as temperature, the rainfall, means of rainfall and the duration of
rainfall.
The first idea about distribution of climates in the world was originally put
forward by a Greek philosopher, Aristotle around 384 BC. He divided the world
into three broad climatic zones. He used the distribution of temperature that
changes according to the latitudinal location of the world as the basis for this
division. Later, persons like Austin Miller, Thornthwaite and Keppen have
presented wide climatic classifications at global level. Sub-climatic types have
been identified according to the specific features within the main climatic zones.
The three main climatic zones which are based on the distribution of the latitudinal
temperature in the world are emphasized here.
The main climatic zones
1. The Tropical zone
2. The Temperate zone
3. The Frigid or Polar zone (See Figure 2.9 and Map 2.5 )

Tropical climate
The zone located between the Tropic of Cancer (231/2
0 North latitude) and Tropic
of Capricorn (231/2
0 South latitude) is known as the Tropical Zone. Generally, the
highest temperature is reported in this zone and a very high temperature prevails
throughout the year (over 180 C).There is no winter. Therefore, warm climatic
conditions can be seen. Most of the areas located in this zone receive a very
high rainfall throughout the year. Various types of climates in the world have
been identified according to different climatic conditions that prevail in different
geographical regions within a long period of time. A particular type of climate is
determined by some important factors such as temperature the rainfall, means of
rainfall and the duration of rainfall.

Major Types of Agricultural
Land Utilization in the World
3
People have been engaged in agriculture to produce food since the ancient times.
Utilizing the land for cultivation is known as agricultural land utilization. Various
characteristics are seen in agricultural land utilization. The main feature is the use of
land for subsistence agriculture and commercial agriculture. Although various changes
have taken place in agriculture over a long period of time, its value has not reduced. The
factors for this are given below;
² Providing food for people i.e. producing crops, animal products and beverages
to satisfy the needs of people.
² Supplying necessary raw material for the developing industrial sector.
² Majority of the world population being engaged in agricultural activities.
² The importance acquired by agro-products in world trade.
The objective of this chapter is to study the major types of agricultural
land utilization in the world and their specific characteristics.
Figure 3.1 depicts some products related to agro-crops which are manufactured in
various countries in the world.

4 Agriculture in Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka, being endowed with favourable environmental conditions for agriculture
could be identified as a country which had an agricultural economy since ancient
times. Early settlements were also established near river valleys suitable for
agricultural activities and the Sri Lankan economy and culture are entwined with
agriculture since then.
The objective of this chapter is to
study agriculture, livestock
farming and the fishing industry
in Sri Lanka.

Paddy Cultivation
Paddy is an important staple food crop cultivated in Sri Lanka from the past. Prince
Vijaya and his followers also, who came from North India established settlements
in the plains around river valleys which were suitable for the cultivation of
paddy. There was a decline in paddy cultivation during the colonial era, but many
steps were taken to uplift it after independence. Setting up farming colonies in the
dry zone and the reconstruction of tanks were some examples for such measures.
Towards the end of 1960, paddy cultivation expanded rapidly due to the Green
Revolution. At present, it has expanded even as a commercial crop.
Significance of Paddy Cultivation

Introducing many subsidiary products related to rice such as diverse food
products and various type of animal food to the market
² Provision of raw materials for many industries
² Production of organic fertilizers
² Emergence of different kinds of jobs related to paddy cultivation
Due to the reasons stated above, greater attention has been paid on paddy
cultivation. Much research is being done in Research Institutes at places such as
Bombuwela, Mahailluppallama, Batalegoda, Hingurakgoda and Ambalantota.
In addition, seed paddy and necessary instructions for cultivation are also provided
by those institutions.
As shown in map 4.1, paddy is cultivated in all the areas of Sri Lanka. Among them,
paddy is the prominent crop in a few areas. These areas can be categorized into

Coconut Cultivation
The coconut tree is considered a special tree entwined with Sri Lankan folk life.
Coconut tree is called the 'Kap Ruka' (Tree of Bounty) because every part of
the tree is used in preparation of food, beverages, decorations, furniture, curios/
ornaments and animal food. Things taken from coconut tree are used during
festive occasions too. For example, coconut flowers and "Gok Kola' (tender
leaves). Study Figure 4.4 and indentify coconut based products.

About 28% of the cultivated lands in Sri Lanka is under coconut cultivation, and
this land area is placed second only to paddy cultivation. The Coconut Research
Institutes at Lunuwila and Embilipitiya have taken steps to expand coconut
cultivation.
The physical factors that influence coconut cultivation are as follows;
² Annual rainfall between 2000 mm - 2500 mm.
² Average temperature between 200 C - 270 C.
² Saline, sandy soil and undulating land
² Availability of labour
² Availability of local and foreign markets
Table 4.3 shows the quantity of coconuts
produced in Sri Lanka.
In 2012, out of the lands under cultivation,
about 395 000 hectares of land were utilized
for coconut cultivation. In 2012, according to
the lands cultivated and the nuts produced,
Sri Lanka is ranked the fourth among the
countries that grow coconut in the world. The
income received from coconut cultivation
was 65551 million rupees during that year.

Rubber Cultivation
Rubber cultivation which was started as a minor plantation crop in Sri Lanka had
expanded to many areas within a short period of time. In 1890, a British national,
Sir Henry Wickham planted the first rubber plant in Henerathgoda Gardens in
Gampaha. At present, rubber has become one of the main cultivated crops under
plantation agriculture in Sri Lanka. Rubber occupies an important place in land
utilization in Sri Lanka. It is also important as a source of employment opportunities
linked to rubber production and, as a source of good export income. This becomes
very clear when you study the following information.
In 2012, the extent of land cultivated with rubber was 131 000 hectares.
The production was 152.0 million kilograms. The income earned was
50 255 million rupees.
Source - Central Bank Report - 2012
There was a high demand for rubber during World Wars I and II and that was a
reason for the expansion of rubber cultivation and development in production of
rubber.
According to Map 4.6, rubber cultivation is mostly distributed in the Wet Zone.
It is mostly done in the districts of Kegalle, Rantnapura, Kalutara, Colombo,
Gampaha and Galle. It is done on a small scale in the districts of Matale, Kandy,
Matara, Badulla, Hambantota and Monaragala. Action has been taken to expand
rubber cultivation in the districts of Mullaitivu and Vavuniya.

Minor Export Crops
Minor export crops are the small-scale products for exportation in addition to the
main traditional commercial crops.
After 1960s the Government of Sri Lanka has paid special attention to promote the
cultivation of minor crops. It is because,
² Traditional exports are subjected to price fluctuation
²
It was impossible to depend entirely on traditional exports like tea, coconut
and rubber
² Problems arising with regard to foreign exchange earnings

Livestock Farming
Livestock farming is a process related to agriculture. Special attention has been paid
on livestock farming in Sri Lanka from recent times, for the following purposes.
² For the upliftment of nutrition of the people.
² Providing employment opportunities for people in rural areas.
² To get maximum use of marginal lands that cannot be cultivated.
² To provide an additional income for farming communities.
² To provide organic manure for agriculture.
² To earn and save foreign currency.
Under livestock farming, attention is focussed only on dairy farming in this lesson.
Dairy Farming
The need for improving the local production of milk has arisen in order to save
the foreign exchange spent on the import of milk powder and to develop adequate
nutrition levels of Sri Lankans. Therefore, the Sri Lankan Government and the
people have focused their attention on dairy farming.
Cattle rearing is mainly done in areas such as Nuwara Eliya, Badulla, Polonnaruwa,
Hambantota, Ampara, Anuradhapura, Kurunegala and Batticaloa. About 2/3 of the
buffaloes are reared in the areas of Dry Zone in Sri Lanka.
Research institutions at Ambewela, Kananwila, and Walpita have introduced
new breeds of cattle and new varieties of grass as well as provided instructions
when necessary. 'Meevanapalana' Dairy Cattle centre has been set up to exchange
lactating cows.

Importance of Fishing industry
To provide required amount of protein for people.
²
² Existence of a wide local and foreign market for fisheries products
² Provision of employment opportunities
² Ability to earn foreign currency by selling fisheries products.
²
Availability of resources to improve the fisheries industry.
Hence the fisheries industry can be considered as an important part of the ecomony
of Sri Lanka.
The fisheries industry can be categorized into three parts according to the regions
where it is distributed.
1.Marine water fisheries
2.Fresh water fisheries
3.Brackish water fisheries
Marine fisheries industry (Ocean fishing)
Fishing in the Exclusive Economic Zone is called ''Marine Fishing''. It has two
main sectors.
² Fishing in coastal sea or in the continental shelf
² Deep sea fishing
Fishing in the coastal sea
The largest quantity of fish is obtained from the coastal sea. Fishing industry is
distributed widely from Mannar to Hambantota and Batticoloa to Jaffna in the
shallow sea. The reasons for the abundance of fish in the shallow sea are given below.
² Availability of plankton for fish in abundance.
² Organic particles brought by the rivers, streams and canals have deposited in
the coastal areas.
² Fish food at the bottom of the sea is brought to the surface water by the action
of ocean currents.
As a result plenty of small fish such as Salaya, Sprat, Herring, Etawalla, Sudaya,
Mullet and Alagoduwa are bred in this coastal area,
For Free Distribution
73
Deep sea fishing industry
Large fish such as Thalapath (Sword fish), Thora (seer), Mora (Shark), Koppara,
Kelawalla, Balaya (tuna) are caught in the deep sea. Deep sea fishing is done under
state patronage as well as under private enterprise. Various kinds of fishing gear
(tackle) is used to harvest such kinds of fish. Figure 4.10 shows such tackle.
Figure 4.10
Tackle used in the fishing industry
Fresh water fishing industry
Fresh water fishing comprises fishing in inland water bodies such as rivers, streams,
canals, tanks and ponds in Sri Lanka. Fish such as Lula, Kanaya, Magura, Koraliya,
Godaya, Hunga, Maspetiya, Kavaiya, Thadalaya are important varieties of fresh
water fish.
Fish such as Grass Carp, Big head Carp, Silver Carp, Catla, Rohu, Thilapia and
Gurami are being bred at present in tanks and ponds. Breeding of ornamental fish
and aquaculture for fish food are done under fresh water fishing industry.

Brackish water fishing industry
Brackish water fishing is carried out in many places along the coast which is about
1760km in length. The main areas where brackish water fishing is carried out are
Jaffna, Puttalam, Mundala, Chilaw, Negombo, Polwatta river, Malala lagoon and
Arugam Bay. Estuaries and lagoons are the most suitable places for brackish water
fishing as there is both sea water and fresh water in those areas. Existence of mangroves
and organic matter brought by rivers, streams and canals have contributed for the
abundant breeding of fish that can withstand changes in salinity. In places like Chilaw,
Negombo and Puttalam, prawns and crabs are bred on a commercial scale. Multi
National Companies provide aid to breed prawns at present.

5 Manufacturing Industries
Manufacturing industries occupy a very important place among economic activities
of man. Industries which produce both finished and semi-finished products with the
knowledge of technology and skills of man, utilizing the raw materials and other
factors of production are called manufacturing industries. "During this process goods
are produced by using essential raw materials in such a way that a value is attributed to
them, so that they would provide maximum utility".
With the dawn of the Industrial Revolution during the 18th century there was
a revival in the field of industries in many countries of the world. During this
period, certain industries which existed as cottage industries were transformed
into factories producing high quality industrial goods using machinery and new
technological methods.
The objective of this chapter is to study the main
manufacturing industries of the world, their distribution,
production, trade and the modern trends.
Attention is paid on the following manufacturing industries for the purpose of this
study.
²
Iron and steel industry
² Automobile industry
² Ship building industry
² Electronic industry
² Cotton textile industry
The location of an industry is influenced by a few factors. Those factors are shown
in Figure 5.1.
The factors depicted in Figure 5.1 influence different industries in various ways.
The impact of these factors of production may change according to the nature of
the industry, the technology utilized and also according to the period of time. In
addition, other factors too may emerge to influence the location of an industry.

Iron and Steel Industry
The iron and steel industry is a very ancient industry. Due to the Industrial
Revolution which began during the latter half of the 18th century, there was an
accelerated development in the iron and steel industry. During the early stages,
though this industry was located in countries where iron ore, coal and limestone
deposits were in abundance, there are also countries where the iron and steel
industry is maintained at a highly developed level using imported raw materials. As
this industry is decisive in determining the technical strength of a country and in
addition as iron and steel are used as a raw material for production of equipment,
this industry has an important position. In this industry, basically iron ore is used to
produce iron. Pig iron is mixed with other metals and seasoned further to produce
steel. During the early stage of the Industrial Revolution, 90% of the raw material
used, for production activities in the fields of machinery, electrical products and
transport, was iron and steel . Later, when aluminium was discovered, the demand
for iron and steel dropped to 65%. Iron and steel industry which is linked to different
economic activities in the world is also important as a base industry for many other
industries.

Study Graph 5.2 and list the steel producing countries according to the
continents in which they are located.
Although, the iron and steel industry was located in the regions where raw
material was found in the past, there is a trend at present to locate the industry
outside the places where raw material is available depending on other diverse
facilities. Refer to Table 5.1.

Features and trends of the Iron and Steel industry
² Diverse qualitative features of Iron and Steel (durability, capacity to bear
weight, flexibility, ability to withstand shocks, profitable production)
² Ability to improve quality by mixing with other metals (Aluminum, copper)
² Ability to recycle after discarding (old iron, scrap iron)
² All the countries use iron and steel as a base metal for various products.
² Production activities have become modernized after moving away from
traditional technology.
² Ability to smelt iron using alternative source of energy. For example; an
electric furnace could be used as an alternative for smelting iron ore.
² Some countries which were prominent in production of iron and steel in the
past have gradually receded from the market.
² As there is an increase in
demand for steel from East
Asian countries, a new market
has been created (China, South
Korea).
² With
the development of
electronic technology, various
utilities are created.
² Certain countries export steel
as well as import steel in
the international trade. (For
example China and South
Korea).
² There is a tendency to locate
industries based on factors
such as capital and availability of a market rather than focusing on factors
such as availability of iron-ore, raw materials and coal.

The Automobile Industry
The automobile industry in the world is changing fast. Automobiles which are
required for goods and passenger transport are produced by the automobile industry.
Further, at present, the automobile industry is showing a tendency to develop as
an assembling industry as well. Various parts which are essential for a certain
product are manufactured under specialization in different places or countries,
are brought to one place and the final product is manufactured in an assembling
industry. The basis for this system is the division of labour, specialization and
technological advancement.
Automobiles manufactured for various requirements are shown in Figure 5.4 The
internal structure, the strength to resist weight, size and the shape of the vehicle, will
differ from one another depending on the type of goods expected to be transported.

The Ship building Industry
The ship building industry which has a long history, progressed simultaneously
with the development of the iron and steel industry and also with the
exploration by the European nations in the latter half of the 18th century.
There were a few factors that contributed to the development of the ship
building industry in Europe.
² The high demand for ships due to explorations by European nations after
the Renaissance in Europe and for trade, fishing and warfare activities.
² Availability of timber and steel required for ship building.
² Availability of indented coasts required to make shipping docks.
² State patronage
In the early stages, ships were built for transporting both passenger and goods.
But, with the development of air transport the number of passengers using ships
reduced and therefore more attention was directed towards building ships suitable
for transporting goods (Cargo ships). However, even at present ultra luxury ships
specified for transporting passengers are being built. Ship building industry has
undergone several changes and it has gained a huge progress at present.
When we consider the ship building industry in the present world, it is clear that
ships are being built, considering the types of goods that are transported. Eg: - Bulk
carriers, Tankers, Container ships.
During the early period, only the developed countries paid attention on the ship
building industry. The reasons being given are follows.
² The ability to invest a large sum of money as capital.
² The availability of iron and steel as raw materials.
² Having a great reputation and experience.
However, this situation has changed and Graph 5.3 makes it clear that today,
countries like China, South Korea and Japan have come to the forefront in the ship
building industry.
² Availability of cheap and skilled labour required for the shipbuilding industry.
² The presence of new technology.
98
For Free Distribution
² Presence of ice-free deep sea fronts to facilitate the dockyards, have
contributed to that situation.
Recently, Sri Lanka too has begun boat and yacht building as an assembling
industry.
When the ship building industry developed as an assembling industry, the
countries that built ships in the past, lost the position they held as shown in
Graph 5.3.

The Distribution of a few Industries
in Sri Lanka - Problems and Trends
6
The history of industries in Sri Lanka
Although Sri Lanka was known as an agricultural country from the past,
different historical evidences reveal that there was a certain development in
the field of industries too. The fact that some industries, especially. The textile,
construction, irrigation, sculpture, painting and metallurgy were at a higher
level of development also implies that there were fine tools and instruments and
a technological methodology connected to them. There is historical evidence to
suggest that iron ore was smelted to make metals in the area around Samanalaweva
and that there was a ship building industry near Mantai (Mannar). Accordingly,
we can identify a technological development which was indigenous to Sri Lanka.
However, that traditional industrial knowledge did not last continuously due to
several invasions this country had to face and also because of the effects of West
European Colonization.
Under the British rule, there was a progress in some industries such as processing
of raw material and extractive industries like the mining industry. After
independence, many industries were established under state enterprise. A number
of industries such as the production of
metal goods, paper,
tubes
and plywood can be shown as examples.
Even then, there was no continuous
progress in these industries.

The Graphite Industry
The graphite industry in Sri Lanka has a history of about 160 years. The finest
quality graphite in the world with a carbon percentage between 97% and 99% is
found in Sri Lanka. It is found in different areas in diverse amounts mainly in the
Central, North Western, Sabaragamuwa, Southern and North Central provinces.
About 97% of graphite is exported as an industrial raw material, while only a tiny
proportion, around 3% is used for local use.
Mining minerals, processing, exporting and production of small commodities for
the internal markets are the main sectors of the graphite industry.
Graphite found in Sri Lanka can be categorized as vein Graphite and mica.

Tables 6.3 and 6.4 show the main countries to which Sri Lanka exported graphite,
the amount exported and the income earned between 2009-2011. Accordingly,
we can notice that the income earned from exports and the amount exported has
undergone changes within that period. Japan, U.S.A and China are the countries
which have bought the largest amount of graphite from Sri Lanka.

Problems related to the Graphite Industry
² High costs of mining graphite.
² Labour problems (wages / health / technology / risks)
²
²
Damage to environment during mining
Though graphite resources are fairly well distributed within the country, there
are only two mines at work at present.
² A decrease in production at a regular rate for example-Although 6615 of
metric tons vein graphite were produced in 2008 the production has decreased
up to 3357 metric tons in 2011.
Only a minimal amount of these valuable resources is utilized as a raw material
for local industrial purposes.
²
Trends
²
Graphite mining which was under state control is now being maintained
under private sector.
² Use of modern techniques and methods in mining.
² By using such technology, steps have been taken to minimize risks to labourers.
²
Asian countries too have become new buyers in addition to European buyers.

The Industry related to China clay
There are two main raw materials used in China clay related industry in Sri Lanka.
One is Kaolin (Kiri meti) and the other is feldspar (Bola meti). Kaolin is needed to
make high quality porcelain and feldspar is used to make floor tiles and ceramicware.
In producing goods related to china clay, minerals other than clay like feldspar,
silica, quartz and calcite are also used as raw materials. The availability of all these
raw materials in the country is also a reason for the development of this industry.
Very often , distribution of China clay deposits are found in the wet zone lowland
areas. There are also Kaolin deposits in Rattota and Matale. The easy accesibility
of clay has caused the industry to be located in the same areas where it is found.

Products related to the electronic industry
Electronic goods differ from electrical equipment because they are high-tech
components and are cordless, (wireless) and need electricity to operate them. Often
it is seen that some electrical equipment too includes electronic components.
As the local demand for electronic goods is growing, the industry too is
developing. The electronic industry exists especially as an assembling industry
and some electronic goods are exported to the foreign market. In 2009 the export
of electronic goods brought a revenue of 187.51 million USD while in 2011 the
revenue has gone upto 312.61 million USD.
Distribution
Very often, the electronic equipment industry is considered as a medium scale
industry. Hence, it is distributed in Colombo and the suburbs and also in the
Investment Promotion Zones.
Problems

The Petro Chemical industry
The petro chemical industry is defined as an industry where the residue left over
after obtaining petrol, diesel, kerosene and liquid fuel at the refinery is used to make
other by-products.
Since Sri Lanka obtains a major part of the necessities of mineral oil from imported
crude oil, the raw materials for the petro-chemical industry depends on the capacity
of the crude oil refinery. Hence the size of this industry too is decided on the quantity
of raw material available. This industry can be especially considered as a capital
intensive industry, where new technological systems and machinery are used in
abundance.
Among the export composition in the year 2012, mineral oil related products
were in the range of 5 % and the revenue brought in was 463 million U.S dollars
(Central Bank Report of Sri Lanka 2012) Refer Graph 6.2. Accordingly, a number

Automobile Assembling and Boat Building Industries
Automobiles
The automobile assembling industry, though started recently, is an industry
that shows signs of progress in Sri Lanka.The high demand for automobiles in Sri
Lanka, and the exorbitant price of imported vehicles, resulted in the establishment
of the automobile assembling industry. Although Upali Fiat and Mazda automobile
assembling industry started about four decades back, this industry failed to make
a continuous progress.
The Micro automobile industry which began in 2001 too, started as an assembling
industry. The main, Micro automobile assembling factory is located at Polgahawela.

Boat building
Due to the expansion of fisheries activities and the development of the tourist sector
in Sri Lanka, the local demand for medium and small sized boats increased. The
traditional experience in boat building using timber in the country too helped in
building boats of high quality. The foreign demand for boats built in Sri Lanka is
also rising. A large number of private entrepreneurs make boats both for the local
and foreign markets.
In 2006, Sri Lanka earned 7.64 million U.S. Dollars by exporting boats to countries
like India, Maldives, Singapore, Norway, South Korea and Seychelles. By 2010 the
earnings increased to 97 million U.S Dollars. (Source: www.Sri lankaexpo.com)

Food and Beverages producing Industry
The food and beverages that are processed and produced in Sri Lanka come under
this industry. There is a large number of investors engaged in this industry. They
are distributed throughout the country, as medium and small scale industries as well
as industries at cottage level. The number of such industries seems to be rapidly
growing. Similarly, when the market is observed, it is clear that there is a large
number of food and beverage items available.
As people are extremely busy within the changing socio-economic set up in Sri
Lanka, there is a gradually growing demand for packeted food and beverages. The
demand for such goods has also grown with the rise in the purchasing power of the
consumers. The importance of this industry is clearly shown by the contribution
of 31% in the composition of the industrial products in 2012 (Refer Graph 6.1) A
considerable amount of foreign exchange had been earned by the export of processed
food. In 2011 the earnings from such exports were 94.88 millions U.S.Dollars.

Cottage industries
Cottage industry is a specific small industry based on family labour and carried
out either within a household of the investor or in his vicinity with a small amount
of capital invested. Sometimes, small hand-operated machines and also light
electrical machinery are used, but mostly the use of traditional skill techniques
is a prominent feature. Preservation of local art, traditions and cultural heritage in

The Tourist Industry
There is a long history about the arrival of travellers in Sri Lanka. The travelogues
written by various travellers confirm that even in the past, Sri Lanka has been
identified as an attractive country.
Sri Lanka is famous as a country that has acquired a historical heritage, an
environmental heritage, a heritage of tangible innovations as well as an intangible
heritage of hospitality and compassion. The tourist industry has an important place
in the economy of Sri Lanka.
Table 6.7 depicts the number of tourists arrived in Sri Lanka in the recent past, the
revenue accrued from tourists and the number of people employed. It shows the fast
development that has taken place in all three sectors.

Introduction to Maps
The universal media of expression in which, the geographical information of
the earth is represented to a scale on a flat surface is known as a map. Maps
occupy a prominent place among the methods and techniques used to present
geographical data and information. Hence, it is important to be aware of map
reading, construction of maps and uses of maps.
The main objective of this chapter is to create an understanding about,
Introduction to a map.
²
² Types of maps and their uses
² Basic features of the 1: 50 000 Topographic maps used in Sri
Lanka.
Using maps for various purposes has taken
place since ancient times. A map drawn on
a clay tablet by a Mesopotamian to show the
location of the region where he lived over
5000 years ago is considered as the oldest
map discovered so far. Even in such eras, man
was enthusiastic to map some features found
in his surroundings. Cartography which
began in that manner, has evolved up to the
present, to become a developed science.

Topographic maps of Sri Lanka
Among the maps of different scales, the 1:50 000 Topographical map occupies
a prominent place. It is accepted as a medium scale map. At the beginning
of the 1980 decade, the Survey Department of Sri Lanka began to construct
a map of Sri Lanka using metric measurements. The scale of this map is
1:50 000 and contour interval is set 20 metres. The distance of 1km on
land is represented on this map by 2cm. The longest distance of Sri Lanka

from Point Pedro to Dondra Head is 432km. The
maximum breadth from Colombo to Sangamankanda
Point is 224km. (Refer Map 7.4) According to 1:50 000
scale, the length of this map is (432km ×2) 864cm
(8.64m) and width of this map is (224km× 2) 448cm
(4.48m). Since it is difficult to handle such a large map,
it has been printed in 92 map sheets for the convenience
of use (Refer Map 7.6).
The land area covered by such a map
sheet is
Length - 40km
Width - 25km
Area of the region -40×25=1000km2

Absolute location of S ri Lanka
On the 1:50 000 Topographic maps values of latitudes and longitudes have been
marked at 5 minute interval.
Example
In Vavuniya metric map, latitudes are marked as 80. 35', 80.40', 80.45'
and longitudes are 800.25', 800.30', 800.35', 800.40',and 800.45'.
While values of latitudes and longitudes are marked along the border line, places
where the latitudes and the longitudes intersect are marked by the symbol of ┼ on the
map face. This information is useful to find the absolute location of any place in Sri
Lanka. When the absolute location of a certain place in Sri Lanka is shown, it should
be expressed in north latitudes and east longitudes.
Activities
1. Take 1:50 000 Topographic map and write down the values of the
latitudes and longitudes found there.
2. Select two points where the latitudes and the longitudes intersect and write
the absolute location of those points.

Activity
Refer to an 1:50 000 Topographic map available in your school and select
two places where the coordinates intersect. Show the location of (national)
coordinates of those places.
Indicating Directions
The direction is helpful to understand the information included
in the map correctly. Generally, the north of a map is indicated by
an arrow (Figure 7.4). Accordingly, other main directions and sub
directions can be identified. On the 1: 50 000 Topographic maps
a special figure is included to indicate the directions at the lower
margin where the peripheral information of a map is included.

True North
The true north is shown by a line that ends in
a star. It is known as geographical north too.
The direction where the North Pole in the globe
is located is indicated by this.
Magnetic North
The north that is based on the magnetic field
of the earth is called the magnetic north. It is
shown by a line that ends with one half of an
arrow point.
Grid North

Location of true north and
magnetic north
The grid north that is indicated by a vertical line with a full arrow head is the
north of the grid of the map. There is a small angular difference (3˚) between
the true north and the grid north. This angular difference between true north and
grid north can be observed declined towards left on the map located east of
Pidurutalagala mountain range and declined towards right to the grid north on
the map showing west of Pidurutalagala mountain range.(Figure 7.7)

Orienting
Orienting is very essential to read and understand a map accurately. Orienting a
map means setting the direction of the map to the corresponding direction of the
area shown on the map. A compass is required to do this accurately. When there
is no compass, orienting the map can be done roughly identifying the direction
according to the sun rise.
Scale
The ratio of the distance between two places on the map and the true distance
between the corresponding places on the land is called the scale. In map reading
the scale is very essential.
In 1: 50 000 Topographic maps, the scale is depicted in two ways
1. Linear scale
2. Representative fraction
Linear Scale
Construction of a scale on a horizontal line is linear scale. By the scale of
1: 50 000 Topographic maps, 1cm on the map represents 50 000cm (0.5km) on the
land. Accordingly, 1km on land is represented by 2cm on map.
The figure showing the linear scale on a 1:50000 Topographic map
Figure 7.8
For Free Distribution
149
When constructing the linear scale
² Draw a horizontal line of 10cm in length and divide it into sections of 2cm (1km)
² Omit the first 2cm and number the others as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
² To the left from the zero, mark 1. Divide that section into 10 sub divisions
of 2mm to indicate the distance of 1/10 of a kilo metre. 100m on land is
represented by one such part. (to show very short distance)
² Write km at the two ends of the line.
Representative Fraction
² To state scale as a ratio is the representative fraction.
² On topographic maps representative fraction is shown as 1:50 000.
² The special feature of showing this scale as a ratio is the ability for any person
who uses any type of measuring unit in the world to measure the real distance
between two places accordingly.
² According to the scale, the distance and area of the land can be calculated.
²
In 1: 50 000 Topographic maps, the scale is shown in the lower margin of the
outer border.
Calculation of Distance
² 1 km on the land is represented by 2cm on the map. Accordingly, the actual
distance of a road that runs over 10cm on the map is (10cm ÷ 2) 5km.
² According to 1: 50 000 scale when a 7 km long road is mapped the length of
it on the map is 14cm (7km× 2).
Activities
1. Select a segment from a Topographical map. Measure the length of a
selected road or part of it and calculate the true distance in kilometres.
2. State the following in centimetres according to the scale of 1: 50 000.
A grade road of 3km long.
An irrigation canal 4km long.
Area (Extent)
According to the 1:50 000 scale, the area of 2 cm×2cm square is 4cm2. True area
represented by 4cm2 on the map is 1km length and 1km in width. The area of this
land is 1km2.

2cm on map= 1km on land
4cm2 on map= 1km2 on land
Accordingly, a simple method can be followed to convert the area of a part of a
map into the area of the corresponding land. According to the above example, the
area of 2cm × 2cm part in a map that is constructed to the scale of 1:50 000 is 4cm2.
When it is divided by 4 the answer is 1. Hence, this value should be considered as
1km2 and not as 1cm2. In the same manner, when the area on the land is multiplied
by 4, the area on the map of the corresponding land can be obtained. It must be
considered as cm2 , but not as km2 .
On land, length of a side of square
shape paddy field is 2km. The area
of paddy field is 2km×2km= 4 km2.
When this paddy field is represented
on the map the length of one side
is 4cm. The area of it on the map
4cm ×4 cm= 16cm2.

The Key
The physical and cultural features of the relevant area are included on a map. A key
is needed to read and understand the information on the map. The symbols which are
used to represent such information are included in the key. On 1:50 000 topographic
maps, the key is organized under eight main headings. (Figure 7.9)
1. Boundaries.
2. Tourist Information.
3. Roads and associated features.
4. Railways and associated features.
5. Drainage.
6. Relief.
