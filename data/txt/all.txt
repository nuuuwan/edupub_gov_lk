INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS' CONFERENCE 
 MOSCOW

Vageesa  and  Yoga  were  selected  to  represent  Sri  Lanka  at  the  International 
Students'  Conference  in  Moscow.  After  the  inauguration,  each  pair  of 
representatives had to make  a presentation about their country.

 Activity 05

Read the following presentation made by the two representatives from China 
and complete the data sheet given at the end.

Ni	Hao	(	nĭ	hǎo)!	Hello,	friends.	I’m	Ming	
and this is my friend Yong. We are from the 
People’s Republic of China, a country with 
an  ancient  civilization  and  a  great  history. 
Our  traditional  greeting  is  something  like 
this: (cupped hands; left over right at chest 
height),  but  now  we  would  mostly  bow  or 
shake hands. 
The  people  of  our  country  are  called  the 
Chinese and our inventions such as the compass, gunpowder, the art of paper-
making  and  block  printing  have  contributed  immensely  to  the  progress  of 
mankind. China is the country with the largest population in the world. It is also 
the second largest country in the world with a land area of 9,706,961 square 
kilometres (km²). Beijing is the capital city of China. Now, my friend Yong will 
show you some pictures of  our country. Over to you Yong.

Thank	you	Ming.	This	is	the	national	flag	of	our	country	which	has	five	stars	
in	a	red	background.	Mandarin	Chinese	is	the	official	language	of	China	and	
here are some Chinese characters. Renminbi is the currency of China. We have 
a fast growing economy as we export, import and manufacture many goods. 
Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism are the major religions practised in our 
country. Over to you from here Ming.

Thank you Yong. If you come to China, there are many things for you to see, 
learn and enjoy. Look at these pictures. They are the main tourist attractions of 
our country. This is the Great Wall of China. This is the Forbidden City, a world 
heritage site that you can see in Beijing. You may have seen pictures of these 

16

For free distributionlovely  animals.  They  are  the  giant  Pandas,  which  are  a  threatened  species. 
Our  government  along  with  its  people  are  taking  many  steps  to  protect  this 
endangered species. Yong, can you say something further about these tourist 
attractions?

Well, as Ming said, there are many tourist attractions in our country. Tourists 
can  learn  many  different  things  here  in  China. We,  the  Chinese,  are  good  at 
many things. One of them is the art of self-defence i.e., martial arts like Kung 
Fu and Wushu. Kung Fu originated in the Shaolin temples. Chinese circuses 
and chinaware are also famous all over the world.

If I told you that this is the end of our presentation, you might think that this is 
all we have to say about China. It is obvious that this single presentation done 
by the two of us will not cover everything about a great country like China. 
With	that	we	conclude	our	presentation	on	China.	Thank	you!	xiè	xiè!*

*	xiè	xiè	(syeh	syeh)	–	the	Chinese	way	of	saying	“Thank	you”.

During  the  school  vacation,  I  went  on  a  trip  with  three  of  my  friends  to  my 
uncle's farm in Bandarawela. This is what I wrote in my diary about what we 
saw on the farm.
It	was	a	fine	morning	when	we	arrived	in	Round	Hill	Park.	The	surroundings	of	
the farm was beautiful. I took many photos with my new camera. 
On arrival at the farm, we saw a herd of cattle grazing	in	the	field.	My	uncle	
came  out  to  greet  us  and  took  all  of  us  to  the  farm.  There  was  a  bunch  of 
ducks	swimming	in	the	stream	which	flows	behind	the	farmhouse.	We	sat	in	the	
garden and enjoyed a cup of tea.

There were different types of animals on the farm. We saw a brood of chicken 
and a herd of goats in the backyard. There was a drove of pigs in the pigsty.

My Hometown

Jersey City is where I was born
I woke up to see many a dawns
It's not a bad city, it was a place to live
But there were many times it didn't forgive
The streets were tough, the winter's cold
It's city you can embrace, but one you can never hold
The streets will own you and rule you
There's not too much one can do
After some years you'll be ready to leave
It will no longer have the things you need
That's when you know it's time to leave
Because in the city you can longer believe
Now people grow up there and decide to stay
But so many many more just go a different way

  went to a job interview for the first time.
- Is that so? Even Asitha went to one last week. He had been told  
  about the particular vacancy by his uncle. Tell me how it was.
-My father had seen this advertisement in the last week's paper    
  calling for trainee computer operators. After he had discussed it  
  with my mother he asked me to apply.
- Had they asked for any particular qualifications?
- Of course. They had invited hardworking and talented young    
people with basic computer skills to apply. They had not asked for  
any experience but they had specified a B pass for English at the 
O/Ls.
- So, what happened at the interview? Were you selected?
- I don’t know yet. When I went there, the interview had already  
  started. I was the last to go in. Well, I think I answered all the    
  questions well. I’m hopeful that they will take me best.
- Wish you all the luck, Radha. I hope you’ll get the job.

Reading

Given below is a part of Yoga’s essay. Read it carefully paying attention to the 
highlighted words.

The person who inspired me most

  There are many famous people in this 
world.  People  can  be  famous  for  many 
reasons. First, a person can excel in one 
area and become famous. Also he/she can 
invent  something  and  become  famous. 
However there are some practical people 
arround us who show us that we can do 
many  things.  Moreover  they  prove  us 
that one can become successful not only in one area but also in many different 
fields.	Sir	Charles	Spencer	Chaplin	or	commonly	known	as	"Charlie"	was	an	
English	actor,	comedian	and	filmmaker,	who	became	world	famous,	has	proved	
this  very  fact.  Recently,  I  read  about  him  in  a  newspaper. This  great  person 
once	said,	“You'll	never	find	a	rainbow	if	you're	looking	down”.	This	statement	
shows how optimistic he is. 

  Sir  Charles  Spencer  Chaplin  was  born  on  16th April  1889  in  Walworth, 
London, in the United Kingdom. His parents were singers and actors. After  his 
father’s death, his family had to face many challenges. As a result his mother 
struggled	financially.	Hence Charlie’s childhood can be described as one with 
poverty and hardships. However his mother earned the living by performing on 
stage. The situation became worse after the illness of Charlie’s mother, Hannah 
Chaplin. He had to start work at the age of nine. All what he inherited from both 
his parents were put into practice. Small Charlie’s will power and talent made 
him a stage actor and comedian. At the age of 19 he moved to the United States 
and joined Fred Karno Company. Charlie could win the hearts of the audience 
very soon. In 1913, he entered the cinema world.

  FUTURE

What is Earth Hour?

13

Earth  hour  is  held  annually  to  encourage  individuals,  communities, 

households and businesses to turn off their lights for one hour, from 8:30 
to 9:30 p.m. on the last Saturday in March. This is done  as a symbol of  our 
commitment to the planet we live in. Hundreds of millions of people from all 
over the world show their support by switching off the lights for one hour on 
this particular day.
They engage in this activity irrespective of all thebarriers such as race, religion, 
culture, society, generation and geography. Therefore, it is a global celebration 
showing the commitment of people towards one thing that unites everyone – 
the planet.
Earth  Hour  generally  aims  to  show  the  actions  people,  businesses  and 
governments world-wide are taking to reduce 
their  environmental  impact.  This  helps  to 
encourage  others  to  join  an  interconnected 
global community motivated to find solutions 
to environmental challenges.

128

For free distributionOne Hour or More?

However  Earth  Hour  is  not  merely  for  saving 
an hour’s electricity; it is a broader concept that 
helps us to understand that most of our actions 
have  an  effect  on  the  world.  For  example,  the 
energy we use, the food we buy and the water 
we drink have an impact on our planet. We all 
depend on our planet and need to look after it – 
not just for an hour a year, but every day.
So, when we switch on the lights again, if we stop to think about the things we 
can change in our daily life, it will benefit the planet in many ways. Across the 
world, biodiversity and natural habitats are disappearing at a greater rate than 
ever before. If we are not careful, we will be depleting the earth of wild animals, 
water,  wood  and  other  natural  resources  faster  than  they  can  be  replenished. 
Things will only worsen if we continue in the same direction.

Conditional Sentences

  A conditional sentence is a sentence structure used to talk about something 
(a result) that may happen ONLY IF something else happens first (a condition).

 “IF” type one (Possible situations)

This is a picture of a market in an imaginary 
island.  In  this  island  people  do  not  use  a 
monetary system. Instead they still use the 
barter  system  which  is  an  old  method  of 
exchanging  services  and  goods  for  other 
services and goods in return.

This is how they exchange their goods.

Luke - 

If I give you my cow, will you give me honey for the value? My cow 
will give you a lot of milk.

George -  Oh sorry, Mr. Luke. I don’t have enough honey to match the value of 

your cow. How about something smaller? A chicken perhaps?

Luke -  What can I do? This is all I have. If I had a chicken, I would give it 

to you.

George -  Then there’s no deal. If I were you, I would give this cow to farmer 

Luke - 

Stephan. He would give you some bags of rice.
If I needed rice, I would give it to him. I don’t need rice since I’ve 
more than enough in the cellar. See you then.

In this dialogue, there are unlikely conditions. Fulfilling these conditions is 
theoretically possible but practically it is highly unlikely to fulfil them.

In type two of the conditional sentences, we talk about unlikely conditions 
that are unlikely to be fulfilled. The tense in the 'if' clause is in the simple 
past, and the tense in the main clause is ‘would + infinitive’.

Condition (IF Clause)

“IF” type three (Impossible situations)

  After returning from the market Mr. Luke felt sorry because he could not 

get what he wanted. This is how he told his experience to his wife.

If I had got something smaller, I would have exchanged it for honey.

In this situation, it is impossible that the condition will be fulfilled because 
it refers to the past. The tense in the  'if ' clause is in the past perfect, and 
the tense in the main clause is 'would + have +past participle'

Reading

Read  this  story  about  Mr.  Mumble  Jumble.  Then  decide  the  things  that 
could have been different for him on this particular day. Write them in your 
notebook. Follow the example given.

Eg  :-  If  he  had  checked  the  bag  before  leaving  the  counter,  he  would  have 

seen the saree. 

One  day,  Mr.  Mumble  Jumble  had  a  series  of  misfortunes.  He  was 

invited to attend the wedding ceremony of one of his close friends. He decided 

to go shopping to buy a new shirt to wear on that day. At the shop, the salesman 

showed him a number of shirts. Mr. Mumble Jumble selected a nice, blue shirt. 

It  was  just  the  colour  he  liked.  He  gave  it  to  the  salesman  who  volunteered 

to take it to the cashier while Mr. Mumble Jumble looked for the credit card 

in  his  pocket.  When  Mr.  Mumble  Jumble  arrived  at  home,  he  unpacked  his 

shopping, and found that the cashier had given him a blue saree instead of the 

shirt!  Unfortunately, he had not checked his bag before leaving the counter.

“No problem,” Mr. Mumble Jumble thought. “I will take it back to the shop 

tomorrow and exchange it”

However, when he went back to the shop, it was crowded and there was 
a long queue at the cashier. Mr. Mumble Jumble decided to walk round the shop 

until he was able to speak to the cashier.

It was then that the security officer became suspicious of him. He asked Mr. 

Mumble Jumble to show the contents of the bag. When he asked for the bill, 

he produced it but unfortunately, the contents of the bag did not match the bill.

Poor  Mr.  Mumble  Jumble  was  called  as  a  shoplifter  and  taken  to  the  Chief 

Security Officer, becouse they thought that he had stolen a saree from the shop

“You have stolen this expensive saree, haven’t you?” he asked.

The  Chief  Security  officer  was  even  more  suspicious  as  it  was  not  a  clear 
answer. He detained Mr. Mumble Jumble for two more hours until the manager 
of the shop arrived. After some more mumbling Mr. Mumble Jumble managed 
to explain what really happened to him.
After two more hours, Mr. Mumble Jumble went home with his new, blue shirt 
securely tucked under his arm.

Good morning everybody.

*Madam Principal, dear teachers and friends,
All  of  us  know  that  our  inter-house  netball 
tournaments are commencing next week. So I think 
it’s a good time to tell you something about netball 
to make you aware of the sport.
Netball  is  a  team  game  which  consists  of  seven 
players in each team. It is mainly played by women 
even though there are men’s netball teams in some 
countries. 

144

For free distributionNetball  was  derived  from  basketball.  This  game  originated  in  England  in 
1890s.  Netball  can  be  played  both  as  an  indoor  and  an  outdoor  game.  It  is 
played in a rectangular court with two goal rings at each end. Teams score 
points by shooting the ball through the rings. Each player is assigned positions 
and can hold the ball up to three seconds before passing or shooting a goal. 
A  game  is  played  for  sixty  minutes  and  the  team  which  scores  the  highest 
number of goals wins the game.
It  is  a  popular  game  in  Commonwealth  Countries.  Rules  and  regulations 
of  the  game  and  organizing  international  tournaments  are  handled  by  the 
International Netball Federation.
I know you are looking forward to the tournaments. I am happy to say that 
all preparations have been completed by now. Remember my friends, while 
we all love to win, winning is not everything. Respect the game and play fair.
Let’s enjoy our netball season.

results - Unknown

  Just play, have fun, enjoy the game.
  -Michael Jordan

I think sportsmanship is knowing that it is a game, that we are only as 
good  as  our  opponents,  and  whether  you  win  or  lose,  to  always  give  100 
percent.

 - Sue Wicks –basketball player

 Activity 08

Read the following article and answer the questions given below.

The  wheel  has  been  an  essential  part  of  human 

life  from  the  very  early  years  of  human  civilisation.  

The wheel can be best described as a circular object 

that  rotates  on  an  axial  bearing.  The  earliest  wheels 

were  known  to  be  wooden  disks  with  a  hole  in  the 

middle for the axle. The word wheel first came from 

an Old English word. In Sanskrit, the wheel is called 

chakra to mean round or circle. It is believed that the 

wheel first originated around 3500 BC in Mesopotamia (part of modern -day 

Iraq) where it was used for chariots.  Some argue that it was invented by the 

Mesopotamians, the Northern Caucasus and Central Europeans. Therefore, the 

issue of where the wheel originated in still remains a mystery. 

  The next step in the evolution of the wheel was made by the Egyptians 1500 

years later in 2000 BC when they used spokes in their wheels and proudly used 

them in their chariots while the Greeks have the honour of introducing the cross 

bar or the H-type wheel. 

  The other significant developments in the evolution of the wheel includes the 

introduction of wire tension spoke in 1802 when G. F. Bauer obtained a patent 

for  it  and  the  introduction  of  a  new  type  of  tire  in  1845  by  R.W. Thompson 

which was improved later by John Dunlop in 1888. 

  The wheel was one of the central technologies which boosted the industrial 

revolution.  The  invention  of  the  wheel  has  contributed  immensely  to  the 

development  of  technology  and  the  most  significant  being  the  water  wheel, 

the cog wheel and the spinning wheel. Some of the latest developments of the 

wheel include the propeller, the jet engine and flywheel and the turbine. 

The  wheel  which  originated  so  long  ago  has  passed  through  many  stages  of  

development and change and is now presented in very attractive forms. Today, 

one cannot even imagine any mechanism without a wheel, can you?

An Unforgettable Trip 

The trip we made to Kataragama during my school holidays was an unforgettable 

one. We left home early in the morning and reached Kataragama by the evening. 

Everybody got out of the van and began to unload the baggage. My uncle got 

on to the roof of the van and began to untie the rope so that they could unload 

the pots and pans. We took our bags into the room to unpack our clothes. My 

mother and  aunt went to the kitchen to prepare dinner. After a few minutes I 

heard them laughing loudly. They seemed to be enjoying the cooking. As we 

were sleepy and tired we had our dinner and went to bed early.  

The following morning, we woke up early and had a bath in the beautiful Menik 

Ganga. Next, we went to the Kiri Vehera and the Kataragama Kovil.  We waited 

patiently in line at the Kovil to offer a basket of fruits to the Kataragama Deity. 

We spent the rest of the day walking around the historic city of Kataragama. 

I was very unhappy to see a lot of garbage left carelessly all around the city. 

I  wish  that  people  were  more  thoughtful  of  the  environment  and  were  more 

careful when they throw garbage. We all came back to the guest house later in 

the evening and packed our bags quickly to go back home.

Dear Sir,

Complaint against Dumping Garbage in Public Places

I  would  like  to  bring  to  your  attention  a  problem  that  is  faced  by  the 
residents of this area. 
We have noticed that there is a lot of garbage that has been disposed 
around the tank bund for the past few months.The tank bund has been 
a place where many children gather in the evening to play and we have 
worked very hard to keep that area clean. But today, we see that many 
ice-cream cups, food wrappers, and polythene bags have been carelessly 
thrown away all over the area. On rainy days, there is a bad odour in and 
around the area and there is the risk of spread  of diseases.
Please be kind enough to look into this matter as soon as possible.
Thank you.
Yours faithfully,
FJPeris
F.J. Peiris.

Reading and Writing

Read the passage about the Internet and write its positive and the negative 
effects in the table given at the end.

Internet: a boon or a bane?

With the advent of the Internet, life has been made easier with quick access 
to information and the number of tasks that can be performed online. But is 
it only convenient or are there any negative effects associated with its use?

Undoubtedly,  the  Internet  has  many  positive  effects  as  Internet  search 
engines  have  advanced  to  provide  quick  information  retrieval  systems 
providing access to any kind of information for internet users within a very 
short time. 

In addition  it has paved the way for some of the most effective means of 
communication among people, including email chat and Skype. It has also 
enabled      businessmen  to  do  online  transactions  with  their  clients  and 
customers without meeting them.

In addition to these, it has also allowed the exchange of ideas and materials 
among scientists, university professors, and students. It has also provided 
servers, resource centers and online tools for their research and scholarly  
activities.  Moreover,  millions  of  books,  journals  and  other  material  have 
been made available online through the Internet which have enabled people 
to learn all sorts of new things.

Along with these positive things, the internet can have negative effects, too. 
One such negative effect is the misinformation that it may provide. Many 
people trust the Internet for information. Students use it for research to 

59

For free distributionhelp  them  with  their  homework  while  adults  use  it  to  find  information  on 
things, such as medical or financial advice. The Internet, for all its wondrous 
abilities, is still unreliable due to bogus sites and misinformation. Addiction 
to the internet is another negative effect. 

Many  cases  have been reported  where the addiction to online social networks 
such as Facebook, Twitter and online games have affected the studies and 
day-to-day work especially of students. Moreover, the convenience of the 
Internet has allowed people to become less active. 

As  people  are  able  to  shop  online,  and  with  the  amount  of  time  they 
spent on checking emails and surfing the World Wide Web, they have 
become  less  active  causing  many  health  problems.  Sociologists  have 
also warned about the gradual decrease of  interpersonal relationships 
among family members due to excessive use of the Internet.

Among  the  negative  effects,  cyber  bullying  is  another  aspect  which 
cause stress and anxiety to many victims. Sometimes people are robbed 
of  their  identities  and  their  possessions  through  the  Internet.  Theft 
is  easily  committed  by  experienced  computer  hackers.  Therefore  the 
negative effects of the Internet on privacy have become a major threat 
to its users. Many users of the social networks such as Facebook expose 
their  privacy  not  knowing  of  its  adverse  effects.  Sometimes  they  are 
exposed to the entire world without their knowledge or consent which  
can  lead  to  disaster.  Many  such  cases  have  been  reported  recently. 
Therefore, the users of the Internet have to be aware of its proper use in 
order to minimize its negative effects.

The Two Frogs (A Greek fable-Aesop’s)

Once there were two frogs living in a marsh. Unfortunately, during one hot 

summer the marsh dried up. One frog sorrowfully said to the other, “We 
have been living in this marsh happily, but we can’t live here anymore. We 
have to find another place to live.” So they left the march to look for another 
place to live. After a tiring journey they came to a deep well which contained 
a lot of water. One of the frogs said to the other “This is indeed a good place.  
Let  us  jump  right  in.”  But  the  other  frog  replied,”  I  do  not  think  so.  How 
would we get out if this well dried up like the marsh?”

a) Think before you leap.
b) Appearances are deceptive.
c) Things are not always what they seem.

Plucking up a Crop to Help it Grow  (A Chinese fable)

Once there lived a very impatient man.  He did not like to wait for things 

to happen in their natural course. He always expected results too quickly.  
He went to his field every day. The growth of the crop was too slow for him. 
“I have been waiting for such a long time. My crop has not grown much,” he 
thought.” I must do something to make it grow faster.” As a solution he pulled 
the plants up a little. They looked slightly taller. The man went home happily 
thinking he had helped the growth. But, on the following day, he saw that his 
entire crop had died.

a) Think before you leap.

Education of the Young Lion (A Russian fable)

Lion,  the  King  of  the  jungle  wanted  to  find  a  teacher  for  his  son.    Fox, 

though clever, was a liar. Mole was methodical and careful, but he lacked 
foresight. Panther was a brave fighter; but he did not know anything about 
the law of the jungle or its politics. No animal was fit to be the teacher of the 
prince.
One day he found his old friend Eagle, the monarch of the birds. “I have been 
trying to find a teacher for my son, but none of the animals are wise enough,” 
Lion said. Then Eagle, as a favour to his friend, offered to teach him. The lion 
was overjoyed. His son would be learning from a king. He sent the young lion 
with Eagle to be educated.
Time  passed. The  young  lion  finished  his  education  and  came  home.  “The 
whole kingdom has been waiting for your return,” said the father. “Now tell 
us how your education has prepared you for kingship.” “Father, I know about 
all the needs of every bird, said the prince. “I know about the seeds they eat, 
eggs they lay and how they find food and water. I can even teach our animals 
how to build nests.”  The old king shook his head sadly. He realized that his 
son had not been taught what he needed most; the needs and interests of his 
own people.

a) Education which does not prepare people to serve their society is fruitless.
b) A hero is brave in deeds as well as words. 
c) Try before you trust.

Myths

A myth is an ancient story which often involves gods, humans and other natural 
or  supernatural  events.  Myths  have  a  purpose  and  try  to  explain  the  way  of 
the world. Myths are commonly found in both Eastern and Western literature. 
These two myths are taken from Indian and Greek mythology.

Bhrigu and the Three Gods (An Indian myth) 

Once,  the  great  sages*  of  India  held  an  assembly  to 

discuss  religious  and  philosophical*  matters.  The 
following question was raised in this assembly: “Of the three 
predominating* gods Brahma, Siva and Vishnu, who was the 
greatest and most worthy of worship? ” They went on discussing 
this for a long time and yet could not reach a conclusion. So 

they chose the sage Bhrigu to meet the three gods and test them. 
First  Bhrigu  went  to  meet  god  Brahma  and  neglected  the  proper  forms  of 
respect. Brahma very angrily reproached Bhrigu, but when Bhrigu apologized

Next,  Bhrigu  went  to  god  Siva’s  palace.  There  too  he  omitted  the  forms  of 
respect.  Siva  became  furious  and  was  ready  to  burn  him  with  his  third  eye. 
Bhrigu had to beg for forgiveness and mercy. At last Siva relented and let him 
go.
Finally  Bhigu  went  to  see  god Vishnu.  He  saw  that Vishnu  was  sleeping  on 
the floor and kicked him in the chest. Vishnu woke up immediately and asked 
Bhrigu if he had hurt his foot. Then he kindly massaged Bhrigu’s foot.  Upon 
this, Bhrigu declared Vishnu most worthy of worship because he conquered* 
with kindness.

Orpheus and Eurydice (A Greek Myth)

Once  there  was  a  famous  musician  called 

Orpheus.  He  was  considered  the  greatest 
musician of the time. Apollo, the Greek god of 
music,  admired  him  very  much  and  presented 
him with a “lyre,” a musical instrument. No one 
could  resist  his  music.  Humans  and  gods  alike 
were charmed by his music. It was said that even 
wild beasts used to sit and listen to him.
Meanwhile Orpheus met a wood nymph called 
Eurydice. Nymphs were supposed to be minor nature deities who looked like 
beautiful women. They fell in love with each other and got married. They were 
very happy. One day Eurydice had the misfortune of stepping on a snake. The 
snake bit her and she died. Orpheus was heartbroken. He refused to accept that

his wife was dead. Orpheus was a brave man. He decided to go to the land of 
the dead to bring his wife back. He was not afraid to take on such a perilous 
journey.
After travelling for a long time, he reached the shores of the River Styx, the 
river which separated the world of the living and the world of the dead. There, 
he met Charon, the boatman of the underworld. Charon refused to take Orpheus 
in his boat. “No one but the dead can enter the underworld”, he said. But clever 
Orpheus,  playing  his  lyre,  persuaded  Charon  to  row  him  across  the  river. 
Then,  he  charmed  Cerberus,  the  enormous  three-headed  guardian  dog  of  the 
underworld with his music. The dog let him pass.
Hades and Persephone, the king and the queen of the underworld were amazed 
by the purpose of his visit. They were also enchanted  by his music and felt sorry 
for him. “I will give you one chance,” Hades said. He agreed to let Orpheus take 
Eurydice back. “If you don’t look back until you reach the world of the living, 
she  will  be  yours.  But  if  you  break  your  promise,  she  will  turn  into  a  spirit 
again,” Hades warned. 
Orpheus  agreed  and  began  the  journey.  But,  as  he  stepped  from  the  cave  of 
the  underworld,  he  became  impatient.  He  turned  back  to  look  at  his  wife. 
Sadly, Eurydice had not yet fully emerged. At once she sank back murmuring 
“farewell.”

Folk tales

A folk tale is a story that originated in a particular culture, and has typically 

passed on by word of mouth.

Read and enjoy the following folk tale.

  Once there was a man who had four sons. They were always fighting with 

each other. The father was worried and wanted to teach them a good lesson. 

When  he  was  very  ill  and  lay 

dying  in  his  bed,  he  asked  his 

sons to come to him. When they 

came, the old father gave them a 

bundle  of  sticks  and  said,  “Can 

you break these sticks?”

Each one of them took the bundle. 

The first son tried to break it, but 

failed. He tried very hard and finally gave up. Then it was the turn of the second 

son to try his luck. He thought it would be an easy task and picked up the bundle 

easily. He tried his best to break it, but nothing happened. Then, the third son 

tried to break it, but he couldn’t do anything either.

77

For free distributionMeanwhile, the youngest son jeered at his brothers and thought they were very 

incompetent. He thought he was very clever and took one stick at a time and 

easily broke all of them.

The old father then smiled at his sons and said, “Children, do you understand 

what happened? It is always easy to break the sticks one by one, but when they 

are bundled together, none of you could break them. In the same way, the four  

of you should always be together. No one will be able to hurt you then.” The 

four brothers realised what their father was trying to teach them and forgot all 

their enmity and learnt that unity is strength.

From that day onwards, they never fought with each other and lived together in 

peace and harmony.

We Are One 

Simba:
As you go through life you'll see
There is so much that we
Don't understand
And the only thing we know
Is things don't always go
The way we planned
But you'll see everyday
That we'll never turn away
When it seems all your dreams 
Come undone
We will stand by your side
Filled with hope and filled with pride
We are more than we are
We are one
Kiara:
If there's so much I must be
Can't I still just be me
The way I am?
Can I trust in my own heart
Or am I
Just one part
Of some big plan?

Simba:
Even those who are gone
Are with us as we go on
Your journey has only begun
Tears of pain, tears of joy
One thing nothing can destroy
Is our pride deep inside
We are one
We are one you and I
We are like the earth and sky
One family under the sun

All the wisdom to lead
All the courage that you need
You will find when you see
We are one

Finger Millet

Finger  millet  (Eleusine  Coracana)  is  a  traditional 

grain  that  is  popular  in  Sri  Lanka  because  of  its 
nutritional  value. It is called Kurakkan in Sinhala and 
Tamil.  Vitamin  B,  iron  and  calcium  are  all  present  in 
abundance in finger millet. It is also rich in dietary fibre 
and helps in easy digestion. Therefore it is an excellent 
remedy for constipation as it acts as a natural laxative. 
It is low in fat content but rich in carbohydrates which 
makes  it  good  for  people  who  are  overweight.  The 
digestion process of finger millet is slow and therefore 
helps  in  keeping  the  blood 
sugar at a low level. As a result, it has become a favourite 
food among diabetic patients. This wholesome grain is 
made into porridge, idli, pittu, rotti, hoppers and bread 
in various regions. It is increasingly becoming popular 
as  a  bakery  product  and  recently  its  demand  has 
increased considerably as people have become aware 
of its health benefits. Organically grown finger millet 
is  healthier  and  safer  to  eat  as  there  are  no  harmful 
chemicals used in growing it.
In  Sri  Lanka,  it  is  grown 
in Anuradapura, Kegalle Moneragala, Hambantota, 
Ratnapura,  Nuwara  Eliya,  Ampara,  Badulla  and 
Jaffna districts. It is a hardy crop that is well adapted 
to arid highland areas in Africa and Asia. The crop is 
now grown on a larger scale in India. It grows best 
in an environment with medium rainfall, an annual 
temperature range of 11°C to 27°C and a soil of pH 
range of 5.0 to 8.2. It is a crop that has great potential 
if promoted as a healthy food.

    NATURE

09

There is a high rainfall in Kanneliya from 
May  to  July  and  again  in  the  months 
of  October  and  November,  making  it 
an  ideal  time  to  see  waterfalls.  The 
Anagimale  falls  is  the  closest  waterfall 
to the entrance of the forest reserve. It is 
just  2 km away from the entrance. You 
need to go a little deeper into the forest 
to  see  the  beautiful  waterfall  called 
Narangas Ella.

Bio- diversity

Kanneliya
Discover,  explore  and  conserve  the 
natural beauty of Sri Lanka.

Location
Kanneliya  Forest  Reserve  is  located 
in    the  Galle  District  in  the  Southern 
Province  about  125  km  away  from 
Colombo.  It  is  one  of  the  largest  forest 
reserves with a high bio-diversity in Sri 
Lanka.

Waterfalls
Inside the forest there are many streams 
adding  life  to  the  vegetation. Although 
deforestation  has  affected  them,  these 
streams create several beautiful cascades.

There are 301 plant species at Kanneliya 
forest reserve, some 133 animal species 
and  59  species  of  birds  making  it  very 
rich in biodiversity.
Hiking
The  water  level  of  the  streams  is  low 
from  March  to  April  and  August  to 
September. Those are ideal times to visit 
Kanneliya for hiking.

    PERSONALITY

What are your special qualities?
What are the special qualities of your friends?

 Activity 01

Reading and Speaking

Vidath  made  the  following  speech  at  a  meeting  of  the  English  Literary 
Association meeting. Read it and discuss the questions that follow.

Good afternoon everybody! Dear teachers and friends, I’m here to speak a few 
words on “Personality.” 

  Recently I read an article on ‘personality’ and this made me think about my 
own  personality. After  reading  it,  I  started  wondering  how  my  friends  differ 
from me. This inspired me to find more about this topic.

Just as people identify us with our name, they identify us with our qualities 
and  behaviours.  So  each  person  is  unique.  This  is  the  result  of  our  unique 
personality. Personality can be explained based on the patterns of behaviour and 
personal traits. Also these things are found to be a dynamic and an organized 
set. In other words, it can tell you the type of person you are, which is shown by 
the way you behave, feel and think. 

  From where do we get our personality? It can come to us by birth and by 
the  environment  we  live  in.  Hence,  people  are  different  from  one  another. 
We come across many people in our day to day life. Among them we may find 

101

For free distribution 
 
a  friend  who  is  very  much  outgoing  and  another,  a  little  shy.  Therefore  two 
friends with different personalities should not mock at each other or compare 
themselves but ought to understand that these differences are natural. 

  Although personality is different from person to person, the aspects of one’s 
personality can be developed. Yet, some of the features of the basic personality 
type will remain unchanged. However, we can and we ought to try to change 
the aspects of our personality that we are unhappy with. Moreover, this will help 
us to strengthen ourselves and become a well-rounded individual. This could 
be started by the help of our school environment. That is the reason why we get 
so many different kinds of activities to do at school. We need to participate in 
these activities willingly to develop ourselves. 
Let’s  focus  on  building  up  our  personality  by  changing  some  of  its  negative 
aspects. 
Thank you!

2.  Who is present in this meeting?

In the speedy materialistic race, 
We have forgot our grace, 
We are running behind the glitters, 
Due to which everyone suffers, 
In going ahead with one another, 
we are pushing each other, 
We have no human values, 
only cry and hues, 
we have no heart, 
only the art
to cheat and to deceive
We can`t bear, 
the progress of other
we, we, and only we

Law and Justice

Defining law

Law can be defined as a system of rules used for controlling formal human 
behaviour and human activities in a community or in a country. Different thinkers 
have defined law in different ways.

Definitions given by  T. H. Green and John Austin are given below.

'Law is a system of rights and obligations enforced by the state' . T.H. Green

'The law is the command of the sovereign and violating it is a punishable 
offence'. John Austin

Every society should be ruled according to a specific law. It is the responsibility 
of the citizens of a country to respect and obey the law. Justice, peace and social 
security are secured in a society where the rule of law exists. The prime aim of the 
law is to control human behaviour by which justice is ensured so that life, rights and 
property of the people are safeguarded.

Justice  is  another  concept  related  to  law.  Justice  can  be  defined  as  a  fair 
behaviour or fair treatment. Justice is meted out through impartial enforcement of 
law after listening to all the parties well.

Dispensing the law should be done in fairness and equality to all. If the law is 
properly exercised  in a country the society becomes law abiding. People develop a 
positive attitude towards the law and trust it. It contributes to create a just  and  fair 
society. 

Following factors are very important to create justice.

 ² Right of an individual to know about allegations made against him

 ² Right of an individual to be heard,  in person or by an Attorney-at-Law, at a 

fair trial by a competent court. 

 ² The right to get a fair and an impartial trial

Characteristics of law

All are equal before law and all have the right to get the protection of law. 
Some of the highly civilized societies, where advanced legal systems prevail, have 
the following characteristics. 

 ² Laws are made only by the state  based on its authoritative power 

 ² They are made with the intention of controlling human behaviour and 

actions

 ² Laws should be fair and just

 ² Laws  should be enacted aiming at achieving the wellbeing of the common 

society

 ² Laws should  adjust in conformity with the  changing needs of the society

 ² Laws should be clear and definite

 ² Contravention  of law is a punishable offence

Sources of law

Factors  that  contribute  to    the  derivation    of  law  or  the  means  of  getting 
information about law can be defined as sources of law. Some of these sources are 
as follows:

1. Constitution 

- 

It is the supreme law of a country

2. Different  statutes - 

They are enactments passed by the parliament and    
they can also be taken as the sources of law

3. Judgements 

- 

Decrees, orders, pronouncements or judgements  
delivered by competent Courts of Law which are  
followed by the other courts of law subsequently.  
This is known as Case law.

4. Views  and principles expressed by legal authorities or eminent scholars of   
     law are recognized as scientific principles of law.

5. Customs               -          Well established customs accepted by the society                   

                                    are known as Customary laws

6. Religion               -           Laws have been made on the basis of different  

religions. E.g. Muslim law and Vehera and Devalagam   

 law.

Types of laws

According to the way that laws are exercised, they are classified as domestic 

and international law.

Domestic laws

Domestic laws are operative and effective within the territory of a country. 
They  can  differ  from  country  to  country.  They  are  enacted  in  order  to  meet  the 
needs of the country. Domestic laws  can be classified into two types as Civil law 
and Criminal law. They are described in the diagram given below.

Differences between criminal law and civil law are as follows:

Criminal Law

Civil Law

 ² Civil  law  resolves  or  deals  with 

disputes among individuals.

 ² Civil law has different branches. 
E.g. - Law of contract business 
law,    family law

 ² Paying  compensation 

the 
affected parties on civil offences 
committed on them. 

to 

 ² Civil procedure code is important 

with regard to civil law.

 ² Civil law gives priority to recover 
damage or restoration of damage 
from the parties at fault.

 ² In  a  civil  case  application  for 
relief  from  court  is  sought  by 
individual parties concerned.

 ² When  a  person  damages  the 
life  or  the  property  of  another 
person, criminal law is applied to 
determine the case.

 ² Criminal  law  does  not  have 
is 
different  branches  but 
classified  as  crimes  of  severe 
nature and minor offences. 

it 

 ² Special punishments are imposed 
or  inflicted  by  the  Courts  on 
persons convicted of such crimes 
and offences.
E.g.-  confiscation  of  property 
by  the  state,  capital  punishment, 
imprisonment. 

 ² Criminal  Procedure  of  1979 
and  the  Penal  Code  of  1833  are 
important statutes that deal with 
crimes. 

 ² In  criminal  law,  the  priority 
is  given  to  punishments  and 
rehabilitation.

 ² In  criminal  law  the  complaint 
or indictment is prepared by the 
police or Department of Attorney 
General.

(01). Kandyan law

Kandyan  law  was  in  operation  during  the  time  of  ancient  Kandyan 
Kingdom. During the period of British rule, this law was restricted only to the 
Sinhalese living in Kandyan territories. Today, this law controls marriage, divorce, 
heirship etc. Kandyan Sinhalese are free to contract marriages under the General 
Law of the country.

(02). Thesawalamai law 

The  term  Thesawalamai  means  the  custom  of  the  land.  This  law  had 
its  origin  in  the  customs  of  the Tamils  resided  in  Northern  province. All  those 
customs were codified into a law in 1706. 

(03)  Muslim law

Muslim law is applicable to anyone who follows Islam. Al-Quran, 
Al-Hadees,  Sunnahs,  Ijma  and  Kiyas  are  the  documents  that  are  considered  as 
sources of Islamic law. Mohamadan Code made in 1806 is currently operative in 
Sri Lanka. 

Eg- Muslim marriages and divorce, estate rights, adoptation, maintenance etc are 
governed by this law. Quazi courts were set up in 1929 for the first time to close 
cases according to Muslim law.

The responsibility of a state is to establish a good society in the country 
while preserving and maintaining  law and order. It is essential to work according 
to indigenous laws when the law is in conflict with the other laws of the country. It 
is also important to bring dignity to the country when dealing with other countries 

under the international law.

Judicial system in Sri Lanka

Evolution of judicial system in Sri Lanka

The judicial system in Sri Lanka has had its origin in the monarchical era. 
The  king  was  the  highest  and  the  supreme  judicial  officer  while  judiciary  was 
functioning under an unwritten system of law. The final appeal on any judgement 
was also made to him. 

Fig. 1.1 Kandy Magul Maduwa the royal court

Portuguese  continued  to  apply  the  ancient  Sinhala  judicial  system  in  Sri 
Lanka  during  their  rule.  Judicial  powers  were  exercised  by  Korale,  Disave  and 
Vidane while village council system or gam sabha was also continued. During the 
period of the Dutch there were three judicial districts namely Colombo, Jaffna and 
Galle. They employed a systematic judicial system.

The judicial system was made much more systematic during the period of 
British colonial rule. Accordingly, the Roman –Dutch law introduced by the Dutch 
was  also  applied  further  by  the  British  judicial  system.  During  that  period,  one 
could appeal to the privy council of England against a decision given by an apex 
court in Sri Lanka. Constitutional reforms in 1972 abolished that power. According

to  the  Law  of  Dispensing  Justice  introduced  in  1973,  the  Supreme  Court  of  Sri 
Lanka was made as the apex court while the Court Of Appeal, High Court, District 
Court,  Magistrate  Court  and  the  Primary  Courts  remained  as  other  courts  of  the 
judicial system of Sri Lanka.

Alternative methods of resolving disputes

Several  alternative  methods  have  been  established  in  Sri  Lanka  before 
going to a judiciary to resolve a problem. It provides an opportunity for the people 
to save their money, time and labour while getting an immediate solution which is 
agreeable to both parties. Some of those methods are as follows.

Arbitration

Problems  arised  between  employers  and  employees  are  harmful  for  the 
respective institution as well as for the existence of the country. Working on solving 
those  disputes  within  a  legal  framework  is  known  as  the  arbitration.  Industrial 
settlement Act of 1950 can be used for that.

Arbitration 

Voluntary Arbitration 

Compulsory Arbitration 

Resolving problem by the      
parties after informing the 
commissioner of labour affairs 
through an arbitrator named by 
them.

It is known as the settlement made 
by force. Settling dispute through a 
person appointed by the Minister of 
Justice using his powers.

Diagram 1.9 – Methods of  arbitration

An individual who discuss with both parties related to a dispute and come 
to a resolution is called an arbitrator. One or more arbitrators may involve in the 
arbitration procedure.

In  the  process  of  arbitration,  a  report  on  dispute  is  given  to  the  arbitrator 
by the commissioner of labour. The arbitrator contents an investigation of dispute 
that should be finished within a reasonable time frame. If there are other parties 
related to the dispute, they should also participate in it. The decision is given after 
obtaining the ideas of both parties. The decision should be published in Gazette by 
the commissioner of labour to ensure the legality. The parties can also reject the 
decision.

Ombudsman

The post of Ombudsman or parliamentary commissioner for administration 
has been established in order to safeguard the fundamental rights and   other rights 
of citizens from being violated by the executive or administrative affairs.

This  post  was  introduced  by  the  constitution  of  1978.  He  performs  two 

main duties.

I.  Preventing the violation of fundamental rights of all citizens.

II.  Protecting citizens from all administrative injustice.

Rule of Law  

Rule  of  law  means  ruling  a  country  on  the  basis  of  the  supremacy  of  the 
law.  Every  individual  and  institution  is  expected  to  work  according  to  the  law. 
Constitutional law is the most supreme law in our country and everyone is obliged 
to work according to it. 

G. Martial has also mentioned about three characteristics that influence the 

rule of law.

Features that 
influence the concept 
of rule of law

Everyone being subject to the law

Enforcement of law through an 
independent judiciary with equity 
and equality 

Availability of an impartial, 
specific, reasonable, just, common 
system of law

For free distribution

19

According to the above qualities some of the features seen in a society where 

the rule of law has been established are as follows:

 ² Availability of an independent judicial system

 ² Awareness of every citizen about law

 ² Not treating ignorance of the law as an excuse

 ² Dispensing law impartially without any delay

 ² Not exercising law on the basis of status, profession, wealth or any other matters

 ² Treating everyone equally before the law

 ² Not exerting influence on judges in their decision making

When this concept is exercised, the extreme conditions that can badly affect 

individuals can be minimized so that a fair and just society can be established.

Independence of the Judiciary

Judiciary  occupies  a  significant  place  in 
modern society. The reason is the priority given for 
judiciary for safeguarding rights and freedom as well 
as to ensure justice and equity.

When  the  judiciary  is  independent  and 
impartial,  a  confidence  is  built  up  in  individuals 
about judiciary. People tend to live while respecting 
law under such conditions.  Constitution of 1978 has 
provided many provisions to safeguard independence 
of judiciary.

The use of goddess Athena as the symbol of

moderate manner. Some of the provisions introduced to safeguard independence of 
judiciary are as follows:

 ² Appointment of  judges

Judges are appointed by H.E. the President under the recommendation of 
the constitutional council. The age of retirement is mentioned and they cannot be 
removed before it. They can hold the post as long as they are in good health.

 ² Removal of judges

There  has  been  a  special  procedure  proposed  in  the  constitution.  This 
procedure also expects to ensure job security. So that  they can give Judgements 
independently and impartially.

 ² Salaries of judges

Salaries are paid to the judges through a consolidated fund. It is also a step 
to safeguard independence of judiciary. Accordingly, the budget has no reference to 
the allocations related to judges. Salaries of the judges of Supreme Court and Court 
of Appeal are decided by the parliament. 

 ² Accepting other positions

According  to  the  constitution  it  is  strictly  prohibited  for  the  judges  of 
Supreme  Court  or  Court  of  Appeal  to  accept  any  other  paid  or  non  paid  post 
without approval of the H.E. President. They should not be employed in any other 
profession. 

This also prevails as a provision to ensure the independence of judiciary. 

 ² Restriction of unnecessary involvements and control.

To ensure independent judiciary, infaluencing judicial affairs was determined 
to be a punishable offence. Judges can function without being subject to any other 
influences due to this provision.

 ² Establishing judicial service commission

Establishment of judicial service commission is also a step to safeguard 
the independence of judiciary. Chief Justice is the President of this commission 
while  two  other  judges  are  members.  Members  are  appointed  by  H.E.  the 
President for a period of five years.

 ² Do you think judiciary should be independent? State 5 reasons supporting it.

Importance of dispensing law impartially without any delay

Taking much time for a trial can lead to dilute the confidence of citizens 
about the law and judiciary. Drawbacks or delay of dispensing justice can make 
an injustice for those who are affected.

Some  of  the  demerits  of  unnecessary  delay  and  not  dispensing  justice 

impartially are as follows:

 ² Decline of the confidence of individuals on judicial system and the law

 ² Rise of anarchy instead of the law

 ²

Increase of crime and corruptions in the country

 ² Deterioration of equity and equality of law in the country.

 ² Tendency to use illegal methods to achieve justice

 ² Spending much money and time to fulfill the justice

 ² Decline of people's respect to judiciary and the law

Independence of judiciary and dispensing justice efficiently with equity are 
essential to minimize above situations and to achieve the concept of good governance 
in the country.

  It is also a prime duty of the citizens to work while respecting the law and 
judicial system of the country peacefully. Every citizen should abide by law since 
it is a tool that prefects peaceful and justifiable societies.

Various Strata of the 

Government

Introduction

 The prime responsibility of a democratic government is to fulfill the 
needs  of  citizens  to  the  maximum  level.  It  is  important  to  study  various 
strata of the government and their functions to know the extent to which the 
government  fulfills  the  responsibilities.  Human  needs  are  complex  in  the 
modern society and the function of government has also become complex 
in relation to these needs. These complex set of functions are performed by 
various bodies at different levels of government.

 This  unit  will  discuss  three  main  levels  of  government;  the  central 
government,  provincial  councils  and  local  authorities.  The  main  areas  to  be 
focussed are:

 ² Comparison of past and present structure of these bodies.

 ² Functions  of  these  bodies  at  each  level,  the  effectiveness  of  their 

activities and problems faced by them in practice.

 ²

In  exercising  the  functions  of  those  different  bodies  at  each  level,  the 
benefits, accountability and responsibility of respective bodies, as well as 
the duties and responsibilities of the citizens who are benefitted have also 
been emphasized.

In this unit students are expected to improve competencies regarding the 
features and characteristics of different levels of the government, their functions, 
effectiveness as well as the obligations of citizens with respect to them. 

  The system of government  in Sri Lanka at present is a liberal democratic 
and  unitary  system.  Unitary  system  of  government  means  a  system  in  which 
powers are centered around the central authority. It is also defined as a government

in  which  all  executive,  legislative  and  judicial  powers  are  exercised  by  a  single 
central government.

 ² Fundamental  feature  of  a  unitary  government  is  that  one  central 

authority possesses the supreme power of enacting law

 ² A unitary government has two fundamental features

- A. V. Dicey

 1. The supremacy of the central government

 2. The absence of subsidiary sovereign bodies

- C. N. Strong

 Developed countries such as Great Britain, Japan, France as well as developing 

countries such as Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal are examples of unitary states.

Sri  Lanka  has  a  unitary  system  of  government.  It  has  a  long  history  of  a 
central and local government system. Even in the past there had been regional 
administrative units in addition to the central government. Those units were, 

 ² Uththara Passa

 ² Pracheena Passa

 ² Dakkhina Passa

 ² Pashchima Passa 

By the end of Anuradhapura era there were several administrative  units, 
namely, Rajarata, Dhakkina Desha, Dolos Dahas Rata, Ata Dahas Rata. During 
the  British  colonial  period  there  were  administrative  units  known  as  Disava, 
Korala, Patthu etc.

Constitutional  reforms  introduced  by  the  British  in  1833,  1910, 
1921,  1924  did  not  include  a  right  of  internal  self  determination.  However 
Donoughmore reforms provided a relatively better opportunity for Sri Lankans 
to  participate  in    politics.  Universal  Franchise,  Executive  Committee  System 
National State Council, were some of the democratic proposals that marked a 
turning point in political history of Sri Lanka.

Provincial Council System of Sri Lanka 

Several attempts have been made to decentralize administrative powers of Sri 

Lanka as follows:

 ² Report of Donoughmore Commission in 1928.

 ² Report of Soulbury Commission in 1945.

 ² Rata Sabha Bandaranayake – Chelvanayagam Pact - 1957

 ² District Councils Dudley Senanayake – Chelvanayagam Pact -1965

 ² District Development Councils in 1980.

  13th  Amendment  and  Provincial  Council  Act  No.42  of  1987  provided 
constitutional  and  legal  provisions  for  the  formation  of  Provincial  Councils. 
According to the constitution of 1978, the provisions were introduced to set up a 
Provincial Council for each province. According to 8th schedule of the constitution 
of 1978, the country has been divided into nine provinces.

Provincial  Councils  are  formed  in  order  to  decentralize    Executive, 
Legislative and Judicial powers concentrated in the Central Government. “Provincial 
Councils” are comprised of representatives elected from direct votes of the people.

Local Government System in Sri Lanka

Historical facts prove the fact that Local Authories in Sri Lanka has a long 

history. Some of the examples are as follows:

 ² Those who held some responsibilities were called by titles such as Gamika, 

Parumaka, Gambojaka. Mayors were called as Nagara guttika

 ² According  to  Wewalkatiya  Inscription,  there  has  been  a  ruling  system 
called  “Dasa  Gam  Palanaya”  or  ruling  by  taking  ten  villages  as  a  single 
administrative unit

 ² Even in Kandyan Kingdom the same type of administrative system prevailed 

 ²

32

Obtaining the people’s participation in administrative affairs and preparing 
central government’s policies on the basis of the views of the people in localities 
are the functions expected from local government bodies. These local government 
bodies are classified as regional and urban and they are comprised of representatives 
elected by the people. The function of these bodies is to exercise powers of central 
government in regional level. Different types of local government bodies has been 
formed in Sri Lanka in order to achieve a formal community development in order

Human Rights and Duties

Introduction

Rights inherent to all human beings by birth without any discrimintion 
can  be  called  human  rights.  Accordingly,  being  aware  of  human  rights, 
accepting and respecting them, executing the duties related to human rights, 
not  only  being  in  the  formation  of  a  democratic  society  the  welfare  of  the 
citizens but also establishes peace and equality in the society. 

Hence,  being  aware  of  human  rights  and  developing  the  skills  of 
implementing them practically in social life are essential to live in society as 
a virtuous citizen. Studying this chapter thoroughly will be helpful for you to 
develop the competencies in you.

Human Rights

Rights inherent to all human beings by birth can be called as 'human rights'.
Therefore, human rights accommodate living in the society as human beings with 
dignity and equality. 

Being human is the primary and sole requirement to be entitled to human 
rights.  We  call  this  as  humanity  in  common.  Human  rights  have  become  the 
foundation protecting the dignity and the well being of human being. In a society 
which obstructs the enjoyment of human rights, difficulties arise in the maintenance 
of security and completion of human development. Accordingly, human rights are 
essential to protect the dignity and existence of human life.

In addition to that, the concept of human rights is universal which is based on 
equity and equality. Safeguarding democracy, upgrading the social  status of citizens, 
and the growth of social justice as well as equality are the main components of a 
society where the rights are ensured.

Important historical events in relation to achieving Human Rights 

Though every individual is entitled to enjoy human rights, man has undergone 
several restrictions in different periods in the history when enjoying human rights. 
The age of slavery and medieval eras provided many examples of this situation.

With  the  gradual  development  of  human  society,  man  has  focused  his 
attention on his rights too. He had to fight against the rulers, struggle and enter into 
treaties with them in order to acquire his rights. Some of those important historical 
events of achievements of human rights are as follows.

Human Rights Charter

 ² 1215 AD  

- Magna Carta Treaty of Britain 

 ² 1689 AD  

- British Bill of rights Act

- United States Declaration of Independence 

- French Declaration of man and citizen

 ² 1917 AD  

- Russian Revolution

Thus it is obvious that man demands rights mainly due to his desire to spend 
a free and independent life. Therefore the process related to rights consists of two  
main aspects.

    Rights

Those who 
demand for rights

Those who are bound 
to give rights

Digram 3.2 :  -The Process related to Rights

The First World War began in 1914 and continued up to 1918. Then two 
decades later the Second World War began. It continued from 1939 to 1945. The 
result of these wars was destructive.

Hundreds  of  thousands  of  people  died.  Large  number  of  people  became 
disabled.  Millions  of  children  and  women  became  helpless.  Destruction  of  the 
property  was  immense.  Therefore  the  world  wars  can  be  regarded  as  instances 
when human rights were severely violated. 

Therefore the leaders of the world paid attention on maintaining world peace, 
improving  co-existence  among  nations  and  safeguarding  human  rights.  United 
Nations Organization was established in 1945 in order to fullfill these objectives. 
The organization paid great attention on safeguarding human rights. As a result, the 
Universal Declaration on Human Rights was passed in the General Assembly on 
the 10th Of February 1948. It was an important step for safeguarding human rights.

Universal Declaration of Human Rights of UNO – Article 01

 ² All human beings are born free

 ² They are equal in terms of dignity and rights

 ² They should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood

 ² They are endowed with reason and conscience

This declaration has clearly mentioned the fact that all human beings should 
be given rights on an equitable basis. It also emphasizes the duties to be fulfilled by 
man while enjoying these rights.

It is the duty of all of us to accept the fact that all are equally entitled 
to  rights  and  our  obligation  is  to  enjoy  these  rights  with  responsibility  and 
understanding.  Fulfilling  duties  while  enjoying  rights  directly  contributes  to 
social development. It ensures the existence of a democratic society. Therefore 
it is essential in social life to have knowledge about rights and duties as well as 
the way they are fulfilled.

United  Nations  General Assembly  has  made  a  request  from  school  and 
educational institutions to exhibit these rights in order to raise awareness among 
people.

This  request  clearly  indicates  you,  as  students  the  importance  of  having 
knowledge about human rights. This knowledge provides an opportunity for you 
to spend a good life while enjoying rights. Performing one's duties related to rights 
contributes to safeguard rights of the other members of the society. By doing that, 
you can ensure the establishment of a democratic and peaceful society.

Activity 3.1

 ² Prepare an article on the topic " the importance of raising awareness among 

students about Human Rights", to be displayed on school wall paper.

 ² Select some  important historical events important for achieving Human 
Rights and collect information about the rights achieved in those events.

Digram 3.3 :  - Classification of Rights

Out of the Human rights which are essential to the human being, some of the 
main selected rights have been added to the constitutions by most of the countries. 
They are known as fundamental rights. 

Accordingly  every  fundamental  right  is  a  human  right  but  every  human 
right is not a fundamental right. Once the fundamental rights are violated, One can 
get the refuge of the law. 

Fundamental rights are mentioned in chapter III of the present constitution.

Article 126 ensures the actions to be taken once the rights are violated. 

Everyone is equally entitled to human rights and United Nations Organization 

has taken steps to safeguard the rights of special groups.

E.g. The steps taken to safeguard the rights of children and women 

On  the  basis  of  the  nature  of  the  rights  they  can  be  classified  as  Civil, 

Political, Economic and Social rights.

International Human Rights Day is celebrated on the 10th of December 
in  every  year.  Prepare  a  speech  to  be  presented  in  the  morning 
assembly on the topic "International Acts on Human Rights".

In  the  present  day,  it  is  accepted  that  the  rights  discussed  above  should 
be  ensured  with  respect  to  each  individual  and  as  a  group. Accordingly  groups 
of people who face problems are recognized. They are paid special attention and 
various international documents on human rights have been passed to ensure their 
human rights.

Rights of Women

Family is the smallest social unit of a community of people. The functions 
performed by the women as a mother of the family is invaluable. Through functions 
like  giving  birth  to  children,  giving  protection  to  them,  fulfillment  of  food  and 
nutrition requirements of the family, and providing education to them, the mother 
performs a great service to the welfare of the family as well as the wellbeing of the 
society.

The  labour  contribution  of    the  women  with  regard  to  the  functions  of 
the family and the national economy is commendable. She also performs a very 
important social service by shouldering various responsibilities associated with 
different roles played by her in the society.

We know about special occasions even in the past in which the women in 
the Oriental Countries had been regarded important. The Sapta Aparihani Dharma 
seven factors of non degeneration, practised during the reign of Lichchavi in the 
6th  Century  B.C.  in  India  can  be  taken  as  an  example. Two  of  the  facts  under 
Sapta Aparihani Dharma deal with the fact providing protection to women. Those 
two facts followed by the Lichchavi kings are given below:

1. Protection of maidens

2. Protection of the married women

Fundamental reason for the society to pay much attention towards women 
is  the  respect  for  motherhood  which  has  been  prevailing  in  the  society  from 
ancient times.

Fig. 3.1 :- Social services rendered by women

When enjoying human rights there are many occasions in which women 
face social discrimination at present. Being subjected to violence, facing various 
types of abuses and being subjected to discrimination are some examples of such 
situations.

Considering women as a group which should attract special attention of 
the  society  the  Convention  on  the  Elimination  of  all  forms  of  Discrimination 
against Women (CEDAW) was adopted in 1979 by the United Nations General 
Assembly with the idea of securing the rights guaranteed by the United Nations 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Child Rights

Children are the greatest asset of parents. They are also the most valuable 
resource of a country and the world. The reason for this is the fact that they are 
considered the back bone of the nation. Therefore it is important to direct children 
through a better present to a beneficial future.

If children are deprived of the opportunity to enjoy their rights it becomes 
a barrier for their proper growth. It may hinder the child from entering the future 
society as a good citizen.

Employing  children  as  child  labourers,  abusing  them,  recruiting  them 
as  child  soldiers,  abducting,  not  sending  them  to  schools,  harassing  them  are 
examples for the instances of child rights violations.

Children become victims of war in 
countries where they undergo harasments, 
lose  parents,  become  refugees,  get  killed, 
suffer  from  malnutrition  and  expose  to 
severe threats. First and second world wars 
are examples of such dreadful situations.

Such dreadful situations compelled 
the world to focus its attention on the need 
to safeguard rights of children.

In consequence of various efforts  
made  by  countries  to  safeguard  child 
rights,  the  General  Assembly  of  the 
United Nations adopted the Convention 
on Child Rights on the 20th November 
1989.  This  Convention  came  into  effect  since  1991.  Sri  Lanka  also  ratified 
this convention.

Fig. 3.2  :- Children affected by war

The  United  Nations  Charter  on  Human  Rights,  Geneva  Declaration  on 
Child  Rights  (1924)  and  many  other  international  documents  were  considered 
when drafting the convention on Child Rights.

children, losing the right to education, deprivation of protection and love of parents, 
and bereavement of health facilities.Accordingly, such situations directly influence 
child rights violations It is the duty and the responsibility of the entire society to 
prevent children facing such situations.

Article 28

Or else, they may have been the result of accidents faced by them later in their life.

Eventhough  they  are  disabled,  like  other  ordinary  people  living  in  the 
society, they too have specific capabilities, proficiencies and skills. You may have 
heard about visually impaired persons who have excelled in certain capabilities such 
as in aesthetics. You may also know about situations in which persons with certain 
disabilities  perform  great  service  to  the  country  after  completing  their  education 
through specific methods.

By improving the capabilities of persons with disabilities they will get the 

ability to perform a great service to the country.

The United Nations have taken steps to protect the rights of persons with 
disabilities by paying special attention to them. Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities adopted in 2006 is an important step taken for the protection of 
rights of persons with disabilities. The Convention on the Rights of Children has 
also taken further steps to protect the rights of persons with disabilities.

The Indigenous and Tribal people

Indigenous  people  possess  a  culture  specific  to  them.  Food,  clothing, 
customs, habits, language, beliefs and values, morals, etc. are examples of factors 
that reflect these specialities. Among them are arts like dancing and songs specific 
to them.

The  World  Labour  Organization  in  1989  introduced  the  Indigenous  and 
Tribal  People's  Convention  for  the  protection  of  rights  of  indigenous  and  tribal 
people.  Recognizing  the  aspirations  of  these  people  to  exercise  control  over 
their  own  institutions,  ways  of  life  and  to  maintain  and  develop  their  identities, 
languages and religions, within the framework of the States in which they live is 
one of the main objectives of this convention. According to this convention another 
main objective of it is to set up the background necessary for the maintenance of 
occupations, languages, customs and traditions, beliefs, ways of life further as they 
prevailed historically.

The aborigines living in Sri Lanka are called “Veddas”. It is the responsibility 
of all the citizens living in a country to treat these people as a special group and 
provide  them  with  opportunities  to  enjoy  the  rights  they  have  as  aborigines  and 
respect their rights.

Elders (Senior citizens)

Even  though  there  is  no  internationally  recognized  age  limit  to  identify 
elders in Sri Lanka the retirement age for the state sector employees is between the 
ages of 55 - 60. This age group can be regarded as the border line to be considered 
as a senior citizen.

A  senior  citizen  is  a  person  who  sacrificed  his/her  time  and  labour  for 
the  economic  and  social  development  of  the  country  during  his/her  youth  as  a 
government servant, a private sector worker, a self-employed person or a person 
engaged in an employment abroad. They also have rendered a great service for the 
wellbeing of the society.

Accordingly, it is the responsibility of both the government and the society 
to provide them the opportunity to lead a good and satisfied life. it is quite essential 
to establish in the society the room for them as adults to lead a life which safeguards 
their freedom, independence, security and dignity. In the same way giving them the 
opportunity to use their knowledge, capabilities and experiences, for the benefit of

the society will help them to lead a contended life. This will also establish the right 
of them to take part in various social activities.

Various social insurance systems have been implemented out in Sri Lanka 
for  the  benefit  of  elders.  Specially,  it  is  the  duty  and  responsibility  of  both  the 
society and the family unit to provide opportunity for the adults to lead a happy and 
contended social life.

It is expected that in future, among Asian countries, including Sri Lanka the 
percentage of elderly population will take a higher value. Therefore, more attention 
should be given to the protection of their rights.

Domestically, Sri Lanka has passed an Act of Parliament for the Protection 
of Rights of Elders (No 09, 2000). Internationally, too, special attention is paid to 
the protection of rights of elders.

Activity 3.6

 ² Name  the  activities  you  can  carry  out  as  a  member  of  the  family  to 

provide opportunities for elders to lead a contended life.

 ² Mention several steps that the government of Sri Lanka has taken for the 

welfare of elders.

Labour Rights

The services performed by working people in the development process of 
a country are immense. Therefore, it is essential to establish social fairness for the 
working  population.  Proper  maintenance  of  employer  -  employee  relationship  is 
also essential for the development of a country.

International Labour Organization was established in 1919 with the objective 
of bringing social equity for the working population. In 1946 International Labour 
Organization functioned as an affiliated institution to the United Nations. The main 
objectives of the ILO are to promote rights at work, encourage decent employment 
opportunities, enhance social protection and strengthen dialogue on work-related 
issues. The ILO has adopted several Conventions with the objective of protecting 

68

 For free distribution

69

 
 
 
 
 
the  rights  of  the  workers.  Sri  Lanka  has  become  a  member  of  the  ILO  in  1948. 
Sri Lanka also has ratified and has taken steps to implement several conventions 
adopted by the ILO.

Protection of Labour Rights 

Given below are the examples of some Acts passed and implemented by Sri 
Lanka with the objective of proper maintenance of relationship between employers 
and employees.

 ² Shops and Office Employees Act

 ² Maternity Benefits Ordinance

 ²

Industrial Disputes Act

 ² Wages Board Ordinance

 ² Employees Provident Fund Act

Opportunity should be given for the employees to enjoy the rights such 
as wages sufficient to meet their needs ( a living wage), holidays and leaves, job 
security,  social  security,  health  facilities,  etc  in  order  to  perform  their  services 
with satisfaction.

If  the  employees  are  entitled  to  these  rights  it  will  lead  to  create  healthy 
employer employee relationship, generate industrial peace and will also be able to 
maintain higher level of labour productivity.

When  enjoying  these  rights  fulfilling  properly  the  obligations  connected 
with them will lead to protect them further. Performing the duties and obligations 
towards  the  employees  by  the  employers  will  be  effective  in  bringing  success 
to  one’s  industries  and  business  services.  Maintaining  proper  relationships 
between  the  employer  and  employees  in  this  manner  will  contribute  to 
success  of  the  production  process  as  well  as  the  development  of  the  country.

Obligations connected with the Environmental Rights

The surroundings around us can simply be called the environment. Land, 

water, atmosphere, soil, plants and animals include the natural environment.

Since ancient times, man has opted to change the environment in various 
ways in order to fulfill his needs. The Industrial Revolution which started in the 
18th  Century  caused  environmental  pollution  in  many  ways.  With  the  growth  of 
population and human needs becoming complex the changes that took place in the 
production processes, too, influenced environmental pollution.

Pure drinking water, clean air, facilities essential to live in an unpolluted 
environment are the basic environmental rights which are necessary to safeguard 
the right to live.

However, the attempts made by man in order to upgrade the living conditions 

of him have unfavorably influenced environmental pollution.

“Human beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable development. They 

are entitled to a healthy and productive life in harmony with nature.”

This principle emphasizes both the right of man to the environment as well 
as  obligations  that  man  has  to  fulfill  towards  the  environment.  Because  of  this 
mankind is obliged to pay special attention to the fulfillment of certain duties and 
responsibilities in order to protect the environmental rights.

Fulfillment  of  moral  obligations  and  acting  in  accordance  with  rules  and 
regulations  enacted  In  relation  to  such  actions  like  protection  of  water  sources, 
protection  of  forests  and  wild  animals,  proper  disposal  of  waste  matter  will 
contribute to safeguard the environmental rights possessed by humankind.

The main law governing the environmental protection of Sri Lanka is the 
National Environmental Act of 1980. The central institution that deals with matters 
covered by this Act is the Central Environmental Authority.

Given below are some examples of institutions/departments that deal with 

environmental protection in Sri Lanka.

Growth of the statutory provisions of Human Rights in Sri Lanka  

Inclusion of Fundamental Rights chapter in the First Republican Constitution 
of  Sri  Lanka  (1972)  can  be  considered  as  an  important  step  in  relation  to  this. 
Article 18 of the First Republican Constitution of Sri Lanka includes provisions 
related to Fundamental Rights.

However, this Constitution does not mention provisions for the protection 
of the Fundamental Rights or measures that can be taken in instances of violating 
these rights.

The Third Chapter of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka (The 
Second Republican Constitution) contains Fundamental Rights. Article 10 to 14 of 
the Constitution deal with Fundamental Rights

Fundamental Rights

Article 10

 ² As stated in Article 17 and 126 of the 1978 Constitution, a person is entitled to 
make an application to the Supreme Court regarding the violation or imminent 
violation of a Fundamental Right over Executive or Administrative action.

 ² Complaints  about  violation  of  fundamental  rights  can  be  forwarded  to  the 

Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka.

Since Sri Lanka has also  signed and accepted the First Optional Protocol to 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that we discussed earlier, 
in a legal case dealing with the violation of human rights, an individual who has 
exhausted all available domestic remedies should complain to the United Nations 
Human Rights Committee.

Present situation of the enjoyment of Human Rights in Sri Lanka

The  Constitution  of  Sri  Lanka  provides  opportunity  for  an  individual  to 
seek the interference of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka to redress of a violation 
or imminent violation of the Fundamental Right guaranteed by the Constitution by 
Executive or Administrative Action.

The Supreme Court takes action to inquire into and determine the petitions 
presented to in this manner and deliver fair decisions by providing suitable remedies. 

The task of inquiring into and reporting, subjected to the provisions of law, 
of the Violation of Fundamental Rights by the State officers and officers attached to 
government affiliated corporations, Local Government and other such institutions is 
carried out by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration or Ombudsman.

Citizens  are  given  the  opportunity  of  complaining  about  violation  of 
fundamental rights to the Human Rights Commission. The function of The Human 
Rights Commission is to inquire into the complaints of violation of Human Rights 
and  suggest  appropriate  recommendations.  This  process  also  guarantees  the 
Fundamental Rights of the citizens of Sri Lanka. Other than these processes there 
are various strategies operated in Sri Lanka to raise awareness among citizens for 
the fulfillment of human rights and obligations.

Through  the  inclusion  of  sections  of  the  subject  of  Human  Rights  in  the 
syllabi of the National Institute of Education, Schools and Colleges of Education 
the  student  community  is  made  aware  of  Human  Rights  and  obligations.  These 
strategies will contribute to build up a future generation who will respect Human 
Rights and fulfills duties and responsibilities connected with them.

Steps  have  been  taken  to  raise  awareness  among  student  population 
about  Human  Rights  and  obligations  through  academic  courses  conducted  by

taken to raise awareness among officers attached to law, peace and public security 
and government officers attached to various other spheres by organizing training 
courses about the upliftment of conditions regarding human rights in Sri Lanka.

In  this  manner,  awareness  about  human  rights  and  duties  by  the  general 

public will establish good governance in a democratic society.

Activity 3.9

 ² Collect  newspaper  articles  which  contain  information  about  Supreme

Limitations of the enjoyment of Fundamental Rights

The  concept  of  Human  Rights  is  important  as  a  moral  concept.  On  the 
basis of freedom and equality, laws and other provisions are implemented for the 
provision of equal enjoyment of Human Rights by all.

At  the  same  time,  we  are  subjected  to  certain  restrictions  and  limitations 

when enjoying Human Rights. Nobody can restrict the rights enjoyed by another.

Even though a person can walk along the road by waving his walking stick the 
freedom  should end at the tip of the other person’s nose

Harold Laski

Article  15  of  the  1978  Constitution  states  the  limitations  of  enjoying  the 
Fundamental Rights. Accordingly, the power to impose restrictions on the grounds 
of national defense, promotion of ethnic and religious harmony, safeguarding the 
national economy, public health, protection and respect of the rights of others are 
stated in the Constitution.

As an example of such a situation is that when there are military or civil 
struggles  or  violence  in  the  country  the  government  has  the  authority  to  control 
media for the benefit of the public.

Role of citizens in safeguarding Human Rights

Evidence can be presented to show the fact that since ancient times it had 
been a habit of Sri Lankans to fulfill their duties and responsibilities. Looking after 
the elders by the family members, fulfillment of one’s duties and responsibilities 
towards them have become a tradition since ancient times. In the same way our 
ancient  cultural  heritage  witnesses  that  Sri  Lankans  have  sacrificed  their  labour, 
capabilities, and skills for the country.

Even when they enjoy resources found in the environment they paid special 

attention to perform human activities while protecting the natural environment.

Fulfillment of duties and responsibilities connected with rights is a fundamental 
feature of a democratic way of living. Fulfillment of one’s duties and responsibilities 
further safeguards one’s rights as well as the rights of others. Furthermore, fulfillment 
of duties connected with the rights leads to establish wellbeing of democratic society 
as well as the qualities like peace, harmony and unity.

Civil  responsibilities  connected  with  rights  can  be  classified  in  the 

following manner.

Duties

Legal Duties

Moral Duties

Diagram 3.6

The duties that should be performed by a citizen according to the prevailing 
laws  of  the  country  can  simply  be  introduced  as  legal  duties.  Payment  of  taxes 
imposed by the government, abide by laws, bound to protect the Constitution of the 
country are some examples of legal duties. Disregard or neglect of legal duties may 
liable to be punished according to law. Care for the adults; look after them, respect 
the customs and traditions and upholding of them are examples of moral duties.

Treating  teachers;  respecting  and  maintaining  social  customs  practices; 
protecting  the  environment,  national  heritages  and  resources;  and  protecting  the 
culture are a few examples for moral duties. 

Abstaining from dangerous drugs, smoking and malpractices is a moral that 
is gererally accepted by society. Every individual has a moral right to abstain from 
such misdeeds and lead an exemplary life. In addition to it safeguarding the society 
from such activities becomes a moral duty of a citizen with good conduct.

Failure  to  fulfill  moral  duties  may  cause  loss  of  social  recognition  and 
respect may be subject to displeasure of the society towards that person. Fulfillment 
of  moral  duties  properly  may  directly  influence  the  dignity,  respect  and  social 
recognition of that person.

Fundemental duties

The constitution of Sri Lanka mentions both fundemental rights and duties. 
Aritcle  28  of  1978  constitution  of  Sri  Lanka  states  the  fundemental  duties.  (Pay 
your attention to the facts you studied about 'Duties of Citizens' in the first chapter 
of grade 10 Civic Education) ( Page 24,25)

The role of the citizen in safeguarding Human Rights 

Fulfilling the duties as a family member

The social unit that a person gets membership with his birth is the family. 

We all live as members of a family.

Think of the rights that a person enjoys as a member of a family. Food and 
nutrition, love and affection, protection and security, education are some examples 
of the rights entitled to from the family. Parent and elders provide these facilities to 
you regarding them as duties and responsibilities they have towards you.

In return for the enjoyment of these rights your obligation is to fulfill your 
duties  and  responsibilities  towards  your  parents  and  adults  which  in  turn  will 
safeguard not only your rights but the rights of your parents and adults as well. It is 
quite important to consider these obligations as moral obligations or duties. Mutual 
fulfillment  of  duties  and  responsibilities  towards  each  other  as  family  members 
will bring stability and progress of the family. It further establishes and strengthens 
bonds among the members of the family.

Fulfillment of duties as a member of the family   

Other than the family unit the most important institution that contributes to 
build up a person’s life in a proper manner is the school. Think of the rights that you 
enjoy as a member of the school.

An important fact that you should pay your attention to is the fact that the 
government spends a great deal of money for the provision of education to you free 
of charge. Provision of education to you, improvement of your skills and capabilities, 
presenting you to the society as a good citizen are some of the services carried out 
by  the  school.  Pay  your  attention  to  the  duties  and  responsibilities  that  you  have 
towards your school. Engaging in educational activities properly, being obedient to 
your teachers, being disciplined, respecting and safeguarding rules, regulations and 
traditions of the school, utilizing resources of the school while protecting them are 
some examples of the duties that you should fulfill to wards your school.

Enjoyment of the rights that you are entitled to as a student will help you 
to make your future life successful. While enjoying your rights fulfillment of your 

78

duties and responsibilities towards your school may pave the way for you to protect 
your dignity and respect.

Fulfillment of duties as a member of a higher education institute   

When you enter a higher education institution to get higher education, as 
an educated, intelligent citizen enjoying the rights you should make sure that you 
fulfill your duties and responsibilities well.

As a student of a higher education institute while enjoying your rights it is 
very important for you to pay attention to safeguard the rights of others. You should 
also have the determination to engage in educational activities well and enter the 
society as a worthy citizen of the country. The time a person spends as a student of 
a higher education institution should be taken as a very important period of one’s 
educational life. By acting in that manner the student can bring reputation to the 
educational institution. In the same way by completing your education effectively 
you can fulfill the expectations that the country has put on you.

Duties that should be fulfilled while engaging in an occupation

Once you complete your education you will get an opportunity in future to 
engage in an occupation according to the educational and professional qualifications 
that you have gained. Whichever occupation you are engaged in, as workers, you 
should  fulfill  your  duties  and  responsibilities  towards  your  society  as  well  as  to 
your country by carrying out your work with dignity and efficiently.

Whichever  is  the  occupation  it  serves  the  society.  Performing  the  duties 
related  to  your  occupation  honestly  and  with  dedication  will  bring  progress  not 
only to your society but to your country as well. You should determine to serve the 
persons that expect your service, to their maximum satisfaction. For the service you 
give them you will get the ability to fulfill the duties in return of the rights you are 
entitled to enjoy.  

The society will appreciate and give due recognition to your occupation by 
providing maximum service to the society. Determine to give more to the society 
than what you get from the society.

Environmental Problems and 
Sustainable Development

According to the information available so far about the planets that exist 
in the universe, the most unique planet is the earth. Keeping the Sun as its head, 
its  location  and  the  geological  and  biological  evolution  has  created  a  living 
environment.  The  biosphere  consists  of  an  atmosphere  which  is  formed  by  the 
amalgamation  of  atmosphere,  hydrosphere  and  lithosphere  and  it  has  created  a 
conducive environment for the plants and animals in the biosphere.

In  recent  times  the  concept  of  environment  has  attracted  the  attention  of 
human society as it has been subjected to various changes mainly due to its effect on 
the human society. Even though, previously, man has maintained interrelationships 
with environment they did not influence so much because the environment could 
bear  those  changes.  Therefore,  in  order  to  get  a  proper  understanding  of  the 
environment it is quite important to understand the real meaning of the environment, 
its components and its extent.

Interpretations and views on Environment

 We are part of the earth and it is part of us.

 The perfumed flowers are our sisters.

 The bear, the deer, the great eagle, these are our brothers.

 The rocky crests, the dew in the meadow, the body heat of

 the pony, and man all belong to the same family.

According to this, environment is a mixture of living and non living things. 
Accordingly all the animals including humans, plants, living and non living things 
belong to the environment. All of them have complex and diverse inter relationships 
between each other. The existence and processes occur by their inter relationships.

This  includes  atmosphere,  hydrosphere,  and  lithosphere. The  atmosphere 
includes the air on earth, the lithosphere consists of the crust and the outer mantle 
and  the  hydrosphere  includes  the  ocean  and  freshwater.  All  these  components 
interrelate with plants and other living beings in various ways. Many physical and 
chemical factors that affect living systems can be seen in these main components.  
For example, solar radiation, temperature, rainfall, salinity, acidity and bases (PH 
value), etc.

Living (biological) Components

Living  components  consist  of  all  the  animals  including  man,  plants 
and  micro  -  organisms. The  process  that  produces  food  essential  for  the  living 
components produced using the energy of the sun is known as primary production. 

Social Environment

Social  environment  is  a  part  of  non  physical  environment.  Multi  ethnic 
status, religion, castes, heritages, customs, rights, duties, responsibilities, cultures 
are  included  in  the  physical  setting  of  the  social  environment.  This  has  been 
developed with the intervention of man.

Environment is the surrounding that we live in. Ancient Greeks refered to 
the environment as Oikos. They point out that the surroundings that one lives in 
consist of  all the living beings, the interrelationship that exists among them and the 
physical, chemical and biological operations that contribute to its existence.

Fundamental study of the earth environment reveals that it can be classified 
as man made environment and social environment. This can be analyzed in another 
way as physical environment, biological environment and human environment.

Natural Environment

Natural environment is composed of living and non-living components. 
These  things  function  as  natural  systems  without  human  influence.  It  consists 
of all the plants, animals, rocks, soil, water, air, weather, energy, radiation and 
electricity as well as natural phenomena that occurs within them.

Balanced combination of these environmental systems is important for 
the  existence  of  not  only  the  human  species  but  also  for  the  existence  of  the 
entire world.

The environment and man

Man  is  a  part  of  nature.  Man  is  an  internal  part  of  environment.  Man  is 
the main component of the living environment which is formed from the physical 
environment. Therefore, his existence will be established within the environment 
itself.  Man  tends  to  change  the  environment  using  his  thinking  power  and  his 
attempt to put this power into practice in the practical world. The result of this is 
his temptation to change the nature rapidly and this change caused greater influence

Thus protecting nature is important.

Services obtained from the environment

Life support Services

This includes eternal services like sun light, air, water that we get from the 

environment. These services are essential for the existence of living beings.

Economic Support Services

This  consists  of  raw  materials  and  energy  essential  for  human  existence. 
Economic support services consist of land, mineral resources, chemical elements, 
timber, plants and animal foods and drinks, etc., as raw materials where as solar 
energy, fossil fuel, bio gas, geothermal heat hydroelectricity, wind power as energy 
Man has made a greater influence on the environment in these sections in order to 
satisfy his needs.

Waste material absorption services

This is important as a sublime service that we get from the environment. 
The  waste  matter  collected  in  the  environment  through  various  activities  of 
the  animal  world  and  through  human  economic  activities  is  absorbed  by  the 
environment. However, this ability of the environment is lost when the waste matter 
in  the  environment  gets  collected  at  an  intolerable  level.  Then  the  environment 
responds  unfavourably. Accordingly,  environment  is  an  essential  component  for 
human existence and man cannot survive without the environment. Therefore, it is 
important for man to maintain his economic activities as part of the environment 
without affecting it.

Man’s attempt to change the environment

In the human civilization ancient man had limited capacity to change the 
environment. He was capable of changing the environment while living in it so that 
the environment could forebear such changes. Simplicity of man and modest life 
style were the primary reasons for this. But modern man has been able to use the 
knowledge, technical and skill proficiency that he possesses to obtain the resources 

86

For free distribution

For free distribution

87

 
 
 
 
that he requires and utilizes them for his own benefit. Man has pioneered among 
other living beings that exist on the earth and he possesses 0.5% of the whole mass 
of life on earth. Even though this number is comparatively small its effect on earth 
is great.

With the evolution of the Homo Sapiens, the human environment has been 
expanding qualitatively and quantitatively into the physical environment and the 
biological  environment  causing  greater  influence  on  them. At  the  beginning  the 
influence  caused  on  the  environment  was  quantitatively  smaller  and  hence  the 
natural environment was able to absorb them easily. Therefore it did not influence 
the balance of the eco system.

By the mid 20th century, population on earth increased greatly. In the same 
manner the human resource expanded as a result of qualitative development of living 
conditions. With the change of the environment, natural balance of certain places on 
earth was subject to change. As a result of this even the balance of the earth, too, was 
subjected to change. In 2012 the world population reached 7 billion even surpassing 
the  forecast  rate  of  growth.    When  performing  his  economic  activities  man  has 
used  natural  resources,  mineral  resources,  etc,  unlimitedly.  Due  to  this,  physical 
environment is utilized unlimitedly for changes that occur on the natural system 
of the environment based on the changes that occur in the human environmental 
systems,  specially,  colonization  agricultural-industrialization,  industrialization, 
urbanization infrastructure facilities and other service requirements. Through the 
intensification  of  the  changes  that 
take  place  on  the  surface  of  the 
earth,  many  grave  environmental 
effects  or  environmental  problems 
and disasters take place.

Environmental Problems

All sorts of destructive conditions make the beautiful earth surface ugly. Its 
effect can be shown as environmental problems. This is caused by both natural and 
human activities. Breakdown of the ecological balance caused by this dual action 
can be considered as environmental problems. Problems created by natural causes 
affect for a short period of time and stabilizes due to the influence of the biological 
and  physical  environmental  factors.  But  changes  that  take  place  in  the  physical 
environment caused by human action do not stabilize within a short period of time. 
This has become unbearable.

Environmental  problems  of  the  Earth  can  be  identified  in  terms  of 
environmental  problems  related  to  hydrosphere,  atmosphere,  lithosphere  and 
biosphere. 

Social influences that take place due to environmental problems

Many  environmental  problems    are  caused  by  the  over  utilization  of 
environmental resources in an unorganized manner in order to satisfy human needs. 
Many  countries  of  the  world  suffer  due  to  this  fact.  Food  and  nutritional  problems, 
diseases and health problems, destruction of life and property due to disasters, social 
and economic degradation, etc., pose serious threat to the wellbeing of the society.

Over  consumption  of  resources  can  be  noticed  as  the  main  cause  for 
environmental  problems.  Developed  countries  utilize  relatively  higher  level 
of  resource  consumption.  As  a  result  of  this,  developing  countries  are  affected 
unfavourably and are  severly  affected by many environmental problems. The main 
reason for this is the fact that resources of the developing countries are directed 
towards  fulfilling  the  needs  of  the  developed  countries.  For  example,  higher 
percentage of natural and mineral resources found in African, South American, and 
Asian continents are used for the requirements of developing countries. Due to this 
fact the resources are depleted rapidly as they tend to limitless mining and quarrying 
of  resources  for  selling  them.  Poverty  of  these  countries  have  been  increased  as 
they do not have a fair price for the resources. Due to their poverty, destruction of 
forests, unsophisticated mining and quarrying and unprotected use of the resources 
have intensified these problems.

Accordingly,  environmental  problems  have  intensified  social  disparities 
further and because of that they have been subject to many environmental and 
social influences.

Damage  caused  to  the  physical  environment  through  natural 
phenomena

      Environmental problems are created by the phenomena that affect the natural 
balance  of  the  earth  sphere.  As  examples,  earth  quakes,  landslides,  volcanoes, 
wild fire, glaziers, floods, droughts, whirlwinds, tsunami can be taken.

Fig 4.14 - Earth quake

Fig 4.15 - Tsunami

Through  the  environmental  problems  created  by  these  natural  incidents 
short term disasters take place. A storm damages the natural environment as well as 
property and when the effect of the storm diminishes its effect also ends. Here the 
affected trees and plants recover or adapt within a very short period of time. But 
destroyed property has to be reconstructed.

Environmental problems created by human 

As  a  result  of  human  activities  on  the  natural  environmental  systems 
environmental  changes  occur  subsequently  creating  many  grave  environmental 
problems. Bad effects of these changes have given rise to many severe problems 
such as global warming, severe changes in the weather patterns, pollution of bio 
diversity, pollution of air and water, loss of soil fertility, occurrence of acid rains, 
depletion  of  the  ozone  layer,  desertification,  saltification,  spreading  diseases, 
melting glaziers and rising sea level. Actually, even though all these are treated as 
environmental problems they can also be shown as problems of the human species. 
The causes of environmental problems are discussed below.

Water Pollution

The specific feature of water is that it can dissolve many substances easily. 
Therefore  water  gets  easily  polluted.  During  the  past  125  years  due  to  human 
activities water was polluted rapidly. Water is polluted as a result of increasing 
population,  improper  disposal  of  human  excretion  in  an  unhygienic  manner, 
releasing  harmful  materials  through  industrial  waste,  destruction  of  forests, 
agricultural activities, etc., because of this reason 24% of world population have 
lost the right to protected water.

Clean water

Clean  water  means  water  without  acidity  or  alkaline.  Ph.  value  of  pure 
water is 7.0. Pure water cannot be seen in the natural environment because it 
becomes acidic by contacting with carbon dioxide found in the air.

Water pollution is the change of natural quality of water or else the change 

in physical, chemical and biological characteristics of water.

Causes of water pollution

 ² By industries

Damages caused to the lithosphere and human influences related 
to them

      Many resources essential for human needs are obtained from the lithosphere. 
Lithosphere is the earth’s outer covering of hard rocks. This consists of rocks, minerals 
and soil. This part is utilized by man for all sorts  of his economic activities. Iron ore, 
aluminum, titanium, manganese, lead, copper, tin, platinum, uranium, mercury are 
included in this. Man uses these materials for his industrial requirements. As these 
minerals are spread unequally they are owned only by few countries.

Fig. 4.16 Iron ore mining

Fig 4.17 Coal mining

Fig. 4.18  Mining

Since  these  mineral  resources  are  spread  not  only  on  the  surface  of  the 
earth but it is also found in the interior of the earth it causes much damage to the 
Lithosphere.

Fig. 4.19 Influences and damages caused by mining

 
These  mineral  resources  are  exhaustible  resources  because  it  takes  a 
long  span  of  time  for  the  formation  of  them.  Therefore,  they  should  be  utilized 
economically. Mining should be carried out by causing minimum damage to the 
lithosphere.

Influences of the damage caused to the lithosphere

 ² Destruction of natural beauty

 ² Degradation of soil

 ² Formation of marginal lands

 ² Flooding

Different threats have been posed to the environmental types of  system due 

to the land utilization

Removal of forest cover in this manner for agricultural activities

Out  of  the  144.8  million  km2  total  land  area  of  the  earth  only  11%  can 
be  cultivated.  Much  of  the  land  area  remains  unsuitable  for  human  dwelling 
and for economic activities. Already a large amount of land area is cleared for 
cultivation. The main reasons for the removal of this forest cover are preparation of 
agricultural lands, fulfillment of energy requirements, timber trade, colonization, 
and  construction  of  industries,  mining,  construction  of  roads,  development 
projects, and construction of artificial reservoirs. As examples depletion of forest 
resource :  85% the in Ivory Coast, 68% in Congo Forests, 95% in Bangladesh 
and 78% in Sri Lanka Forests have been destroyed.

Use of chemicals in agricultural activities

Since  Green  Revolution  with  the  modernization  of  agricultural  activities 

which increased the harvest, the use of chemical fertilizer, insecticides, weedicides 

has given rise to various problems. It changed the local environmental conditions and 

polluted water. Accordingly, many strategies introduced under Green Revolution 

have contributed to pollute the environment. By 2010, 40% of the responsibility 

for  global  warming  rests  on  these  influences. As  a  result  of  this  23%  of  fertile 
land has been deteriorated. (Source: Management of Environmental Resources and 

Sustainable Development – H.A. Danapala)

Disposal of indecomposable waste matter on land

With  the  technological  development  of  man  plastics  and  other  artificial 

materials,  electronic  goods  and  instruments  are  produced  with  the  resources 

available  in  the  environment  by  changing  their  characteristics.  They  reach  the 

market competitively in different shapes. Within a very short period of time they 

become outdated and are converted into waste. All these matter cannot be easily 

decomposed through the natural process. The rate of production of these goods is 

higher than the rate of destroying them and as a result they are added to the physical 

environment as excess matter. This has become an obstacle to the environmental 

process and the outcome of it is the pollution of land, water and air. They are very 

difficult to be recycled.

Deposition of industrial waste

In  the  process  of  producing  goods  and  services  by  man  industrial  waste 
is disposed as a byproduct of mineral fuel, remains of minerals, iron and noniron 
remains, etc.

A  part  of  this  waste  matter  can  be  recycled  where  as  many  cannot  be 
recycled. This has created many problems. The highly critical one out of them is the 
deposition of nuclear waste. Many problems have been created due to the inclusion 
of radioactive material in them.

Air Pollution

Changes that take place in the composition of atmosphere can be defined as 
air pollution. Human activities have been the main cause of it. This disaster began 
as a result of the new inventions of the Industrial Revolution and Green Revolution. 
Particularly this was started when man began to use fossil fuel as an energy source. 
Other than this, sectors such as industrial, agricultural, transport and deforestation 
have contributed to air pollution.

Effects of air pollution on climatic conditions

The  natural  greenhouse  cover  has  been  severely  changed  due  to  the 
manmade greenhouse gases produced and released to the atmosphere as a result 
of  modernization  that  took  place  in  agricultural,  industrial  and  transport  sectors. 
The increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in this manner has caused global 
warming. From Industrial Revolution, burning of fossil fuel and  deforestation has 
contributed to increase the concentration of hydrogen to 26%. Due to activities like

Effects on the biological environment and the social environment

Human  activities  have  contributed  to  remove  biological  resources 
from  their  natural  habitats  or  eliminate  them.  Through  these  natural  processes, 
nonliving  components  have  greatly  affected  plant  and  animal  population. As  an 
example forests, wet lands, bio diversity, oceanic resources including coral reefs 
have been affected by this. A large number of plants and animal population have 
been  included  in  the  Red  Data  book  due  to  this  reason. Accordingly,  while  the 
biological environment directly contributes to the existence of social environment 
the breakdown of its balance also causes the decline of the social environment.

Effects of damaging the biological environment

 ² Collapse of the balance of biological environment

 ² Destruction of endemic plants and animal communities

 ² Collapse of the functions of the bio systems  such as oxygen cycle, carbon

Effects on the social environment

When  human  activities  become  complex  even  the  social  environment 
becomes  complicated.  Complex  activities  of  man  have  even  caused  social 
diversity. Accordingly, role conflicts, functions related to environmental conflicts, 
socio cultural and moral decline, collapse of family institutions, role of the family 
becoming  complex,  changes  in  social  institutions,  globalization,  changes  in 
economic  patterns,  technical  modernization,  etc.,  have  influenced  almost  all  the 
societies in the world.

Effects of the damage done to social environment

Responsibilities and duties of the government over environment

It is obvious that all the animal and plant species including human living 
on earth have no existence without the environment. Therefore, it is important to 
protect the qualitative and quantitative aspects of environment. Government should 
follow environmental protection and conservation strategies. Measures that could 
be taken for this are given below.

Introducing environment standards, issuing environmental protection  
license,   and carrying out assessment to find environmental impact before 
commencing large scale development projects according to National

Development

Qualitative improvements in the living conditions of man can be defined simply 
as development. At the beginning, the concept of development was considered to be 
the economic growth and identified it as an increase in the Gross Domestic Product. 
However, the concept of development gives priority to raise the living conditions of 
a country, improvement of welfare services and economic progress.

Evolution of the concept of development

As the modern concept of development is a concept originated in the Western 
World  it  is  very  important  to  pay  attention  to  several  definitions  put  forward  by 
academics in order to get a thorough understanding of it.

According to the above definitions ,it is clear that the concept of Development 
at the beginning tended towards economic development but subsequently it favours 
the qualitative development in life.It further expands in to a broad concept to include 
changes that take place in traditions, cultures and moral values. Subsequently, it 
included concepts like human rights, democracy, politics, nature of institutions and 
quality of the environment.

Measurement of Development

         Development should be measured in order to consider the economic progress 
and  level  achieved  by  a  country,  By  measuring,  it  can  be  determined  whether  it 
remains at a higher or lower level. A number of measurements are used to measure 
it. These measurements have been changed with time.

Modern Measurement

 Physical Quality of Life Index ( PQLI )

Three components are used to prepare this index. 

 Literacy

 Life expectancy at birth

 Infant Mortality Rate

This index takes values from 0 – 100. This index helps to understand social, 

cultural, educational, nutritional and health aspects of a country.

By this index the nature of social development can be measured. Therefore, 
the real nature of the development can be identified through this. This is used as a 
supplement to the Per Capita Income.

Human Development Index

This  is  a  relative  measurement  which  is  used  for  measuring  human 
development.The  progress  achieved  by  a  country  in  social  and  economic 
components can be measured using this index. It represents human development as 
higher, medium and lower levels.

This  is  a  composite  index  which  measures  the  three  aspects  of  human 
development,  namely,  healthy  living,  level  of  knowledge  and  living  conditions. 
Following components were used at the beginning for the preparation of this index.

 ² Life expectancy at birth

 ² Education

 ² Per Capita Income adjusted by the purchasing power

But  at  present  a  wider  concept  of  education  is  used  instead  of  literacy. 
Using this index countries are categorized as very high, moderate and lower level 
of human development.

The Concept of Sustainable Development

The greatest challenge in the concept of development is the fulfillment of 
human necessities which expand with the increase in population. More resources 

114

For free distribution

For free distribution

115

 
have to be used to fulfill needs of the increasing population. The environment has to 
bear a huge cost resulted by the increase in production and inputs. The environment 
is put into great risk due to the fact that in the process of development man has 
completely forgotten the environment as he pay greater attention to fulfill his needs 
and requirements.

Due to the reasons like excessive mining of resources, moving to alternative 
resources as a result of the scarcity of resources, increase of waste matter disposed 
to the environment, intensification of environmental pollution, etc., we have to face 
marginal states such as damaging the bio diversity, obstruction of natural process, 
intensification of natural disasters and increase in global warming.

Even though the concept of development has upgraded the quality of human 
life through economic development it is revealed that as a whole it has not been 
able to bring fairness to the world community. Majority of the world population 
suffers from poverty while destruction and deterioration of the quality of natural 
resources are taking place. As a result of this, a greater number of people are subject 
to unfavourable physical health conditions.

In this manner, changes that cannot be borne by the physical environmental 
systems  should  not  be  brought  about  for  the  sake  of  the  quality  of  human 
development.  The  interactions  between  man  and  the  environment  should  not 
be  disregarded  and  we  should  not  leave  room  for  the  destruction  of  resources. 
It  is  important  to  pay  attention  to  prevent  depletion  of  rare  and  exhaustible 
(non-renewable)  resources.  We  should  also  utilize  these  resources  with  proper 
management. Accordingly, man should enter into the development concept in a 
fair manner that safeguards the existence of the future man in the globe despite 
the development attempts.

Sustainable development is maintaining the process of development in 
a higher level that meets the needs of the present without compromising 
the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

Evolution of the concept of Sustainable Development

The initiative for the concept of sustainable development was taken with 
the establishment of the World Environmental Commission in 1983 with the former 
Prime Minister of Norway Gro Harlem Brundtland as its President. The report by 
the name “Our Common Future” which was published by this Commission argued 
that  the  “Environment  and  Development”  should  be  integrated.  Accordingly, 
sustainable development is defined as “the development that meets the needs of the 
present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own 
needs”. It proposed to achieve those goals nationally as well as internationally. This 
concept has been formally accepted worldwide and the International Conference 
on Environment and Development held in July 1992 at Riode Janeiro paid more 
attention  to  environmental  problems. At  this  conference  the  agenda  for  the  21st 
century was globally accepted. All the nations were expected to carry out strategies 
endorsed  for  the  Sustainable  Development  and  to  fulfill  all  their  tasks  and 
responsibilities.

The United Nations held Millennium Conference in year 2000 and when 
formulating millennium objectives priority was given to objectives of sustainable 
development. Progress of the Millennium Objectives of the world was evaluated 
in  2005.  Tewnty  years  after  the  first  conference,  in  2012,  a  World  Conference 
was held again in Riode Janeiro. It was held “for the renewal of our commitment 
for  a  lasting  development  of  our  planet  and  to  ensure  an  economically,  socially 
and  environmentally  established  future  for  the  present  and  future  generations”. 
Accordingly, it is quite essential not to deviate from the determinations arrived at 
this conference.

In this manner the United Nations Conference (Rio + 20) determined that it 
is quite essential to improve lasting development further by uniting all the sectors 
in its different perspectives including economic, social and environmental sectors 
and  by  accepting  their  interrelationships.  Hence,  it  is  admirable  that  the  world 
community have paid attention to this concept on policy and legal basis.

Necessity of Sustainable Development

In the fulfillment of human needs and wants under Sustainable Development, 
irrespeetive of considering only economic needs,  attention should be paid to both 
social and environmental development fulfilling human needs and wants.

In the development process it is quite important to be sensitive to the needs 
of  the  environment.  The  social  cost  of  the  damage  caused  to  the  environment 
and the loss of natural resources in the process of human development should be 

118

119

 
 
assessed. Since the economic activities which are carried out with the expectation 
of profit making, affect the entire world population there should be restrictions. It is 
important to set restrictions on harmful things produced on profit expectation. The 
balance  of  social,  economic  and  environmental  development  should  be  brought 
about  by  carrying  out  environmental  assessments  on  large  scale  mining  and 
construction  activities,  industries  and  agricultural  activities  which  cause  damage 
to the environment. Therefore, if we are going to have a pure world for our future 
generation we should utilize resources without exploiting them. The great Indian 
poet  Kalidasa  in  his  text  “Kumara  Sambhawa”  stated  that  the  earth  should  be 
utilized in the manner of milking a cow and not by exploitation. Therefore, what 
is  expected  by  Sustainable  Development  is  the  development  in  that  sense.  It  is, 
therefore, important to pay attention to the Millennium Goals on Environment and 
Development.

Measures that should be taken to achieve Sustainable Development

At present many countries in the world have realized the importance of the 
concept of Sustainable Development. Accordingly, agreements have been reached 
to guarantee an economically, socially and environmentally Sustainable future not 
only for our planet but for the future generation as well. Thus it is important to pay 
attention to Millennium Goals on Sustainable Development.

Main  factor  that  determines  development  is  the  availability  of  resources. 
It  is  easier  to  achieve  Sustainable  Development  by  increasing  productivity  and 
efficiency of the resources. Here the 3R concept is important as a main approach 
that can be utilized.

The  duty  and  responsibility  of  different 
organizations about Sustainable Development

institutions  and 

The  entire  economic  process  of  a  country  is  directed  and  managed  by 
the  state  or  government  sector  and  the  private  sector.  In  all  these  activities  it  is 
quite  important  to  pay  greater  attention  to  the  importance  of  the  environment.
Particularly, these institutions should be bound to be sensitive to the damage caused 
to the environment, monitoring and searching about them, collecting accurate data, 
informing, and raising awareness of the relevant institutions and sections. Awareness 
should be raised about the importance of sustainable development through various 
media.  Especially  development  of  environmental  friendly  attitudes,  thinking, 
behaviour patterns and simple way of living should be established in the education 
process.

The duty and responsibility of the government about Sustainable 
Development

The  rulers  should  possess  the  guidance  and  dedication  necessary  for  the 
accomplishment of the concept of Sustainable Development in the State policies 
and  vision.  Here  it  is  quite  important  to  adopt  a  national  policy  on  Sustainable 
Development. Through this the rulers should be responsible for strengthening state 
institutions, raising awareness among them and directing them towards Sustainable 
Development. All these awareness raising activities should be carried out by the 
officers  of  state  and  state  institutions.  Further,  they  should  be  involved  in  the 
enforcement of National Environmental Acts through the relevant institutions and 
mediation in the administration of justice properly. From time to time important 
policy  decisions  should  be  taken  considering  the  environmental needs  locally as 
well as at national level. 

Poverty of the people can be regarded as a major reason for the destruction of 
the environmental resources. As a result of this, environmental resources are misused 
and  exploited  in  an  unauthorized  manner.  Measures  to  alleviate  poverty  must  be 
followed in order to prevent this. Steps should be taken to minimize the imbalance 
that  prevails  in  production,  distribution  and  consumption  of  a  country.  Investors 
should be encouraged towards environmental friendly production and services.

Definitions on International Relations

 I. International Relations mean all types of relations that exist among nations.

II. State level relationships are maintained by officers authorized by the state.            

Accordingly, international relations mean the relationship that exist between 
two  or  more  countries  or,  if  not  between  states  or  international  organizations  or 
between states and persons. You can easily understand this idea by looking at the 
following illustration.

Importance of International Relations

Mutual relationships that exist between two or more states or else between 
states and organizations or if not between states and persons are identified as 
international relations. These relationships can prevail between states and states 
and also between states and various organizations, or between states and other 
organizations  or  with  persons.  Let’s  now  look  at  the  reasons  for  maintaining 
relationships of this form.

They are,

 1. Obtaining something which the country by itself cannot fulfil. 

As stated above, isolation that prevailed among countries disappeared due 
to factors like the increasing rate of growth of the population and the complexity 
of human needs. As a result, no country is able to satisfy all their needs by the 
resources existing in their own countries. Since resources available in countries 
differed  from  one  country  to  another  goods  and  services  produced  by  using 
those resources also differed. Hence, the world community realized the fact that 
development  of  internatiional  relationship  is  beneficial  for  a  country  to  sell  its 
excess production and also to obtain the goods that are scarce in that country.

 2. Ability to expand relationships on political, economic, cultural and social grounds.

Almost  all  the  countries  in  the  world,  differ  more  or  less  on  political, 
economic,  cultural  and  social  grounds.  There  are  favourable  as  well  as 
unfavourable effects of this but international relations are important in order to 
develop favourable effects further. How does this support favourable effects? As 
an  example,  India  and  Sri  Lanka  had  developed  international  relations  several 
thousands of years ago.

In the same manner, many countries in the world develop relations based on 
political, economic, cultural and social factors. The relations that had developed in 
the past in this way have been developing gradually up to now and we can see that 
it helped to develop mutual friendships among countries.

 3. Protection from the influences exerted by powerful countries

Modern  countries  in  the  world  have  become  powerful  on  the  basis  of 
factors  like  economic  and  military  powers.  Specially,  economically  strong  and 
militarily powerful countries put pressure on relatively less powerful countries 
in  various  ways.  This  situation  developed  after  these  countries  were  liberated 
from Colonialism. Powerful countries put pressure on them politically by means               
of  giving  loans  and  aids,  providing  weapons  and  other  military  assistance  in 
civil wars. Development of international relations of less powerful countries to 
a certain extent helped to protect themselves from threats posed on them by the 
powerful countries. If that does not happen less powerful countries may become 
a victim of powerful countries in the international community. 

4. Prevention of obstacles caused by protectionist policies

We can observe now that many countries of the world follow protectionist 
policies, in their economic activities, for example, purchasing of garment on the basis 
of quotas, imposition of a guaranteed price through various agreements can be stated.

Activity 5.1

 ² Define international relations briefly and explain the importance of it.

Main aspects of maintaining international relations

You know that international relations are the relationships that take place 
between countries in almost every field such as political, social, and cultural spheres. 
By now you have also studied the importance of maintaining those relations.

Next, it is important to pay attention to the main aspects of international relations. 

We can identify two main aspects of maintaining international relations. They are:

1. State strategic relations

2. Military strategic relations

1. State strategic relations

Peaceful  relationships  maintained  by  countries  among  themselves  can  be 
identified as state strategic relations. Diplomatic relations developed at official levels 
through ambassadors and state emissaries can be considered as state strategic relations. 
These state strategic relations are directed by government foreign policy. The foreign 
policy  of  a  government  shows  with  whom  the  country  should  maintain  strategic 
relations and how it should be carried out. Especially strategic state relations are 
established through international conferences, bilateral meetings of leaders of the 
states, specially through foreign missions and foreign ministers.

2. Military strategic relations

Relationships build up on defence matters can be considered as military 
strategic  relations.  Especially  a  country  builds  up  military  or  defence  relations 
with another country or countries when its security is threatened militarily. For 
example we can show the military bases established during the First and Second 
World Wars.

Through military strategic relations military training and specialist support, 
supply  of  military  weapons,  use  of  military  forces  and  humanitarian  assistance 
(like  providing    medicine)  take  place.  Military  strategic  relations  are  important 
particularly  in    maintaining  balance  of  power  among  states.  This  will  reduce 
tendency of one country or several countries becoming a threat to other countries 
by expanding military power.

Different spheres in which international relations are developed

Even though international relations prevailed in the past it was confined to a 
greater extent to a few spheres. Particularly, we can identify that these relations have 
been generated on the basis of trade and cultural factors. For example, the relations 
that existed between Sri Lanka and India were based  on cultural factors. Relationship 
between India and Arabia were based on trade. However, we can identify that these 
relations at present have spread to various other spheres. Accordingly, we can show 
that diplomatic relations now prevail on the basis of areas like technical relations and 
educational relations.

With  the  development  in  the  field  of  science  and  technology  and  the 
revolution that is taking place in the fields of communication and transportation, the 
world has become a global village. In modern science, specially in the construction 
of high speed aeroplanes and supersonic jets and also development in road systems 
international  relations  have  contributed  a  lot.  International  relations  have    been 
developed very fast as a result of improvement in facilities like reading books and 
journals through the internet (E-Library). These developments in various  fields of 
technology have made the global village very much closer today.

Fig 5.2 - High-speed Rail

Factors that contributed to the development of international                     
relations

By  now  you  have  realized  very  well  the  spheres  in  which  international 
relations have been developed. Accordingly, it is worth to consider the factors that 
have influenced the growth of international relations.

 ² Resource disparity or the differences in the availability of resources in each   

country.

Example : fossil fuel is abundant in Middle East countries while it is not   
available in many other countries in the world.

 ²

Inability of a country to produce all its needs within the country itself.

Example : Importing wheat flour and sugar by Sri Lanka

One of the main problems a country faces today is its inability to produce 
all  the  goods  and  services  necessary  for  the  people  of  the  country  within  itself. 
Therefore, since a country always has to depend on another country it has to build 
up relations internationally.

 ² Sale of excess production 

When the goods and services are produced using resources available abundently 
in a country they may exceed the requirements of that country. International relations 
develop when that country sells the excess production to another country for which 
those goods are scarce.

 ² Development in transport and communication  

Transportation  and  communication  are  too  spheres  in  which  rapid 
developments are taking place at present. As a result, world has become a global 
village. Specially, due to easy access to travelling facilities and also fast flow of 
information, international relations have been developing very fast.

 ² Necessity of obtaining advanced technological knowledge   

Many  countries  in  the  world  have  benefited  from  the  development  of 
science and technology but these developments did not reach other countries in the 
same speed. As a consequence of this a gap was created between developed countries 
and less developed countries. In comparison to the development of technology in the 
developed countries the level of development in less developed countries remains 
at a minimum level. Due to this fact, there was a scarcity of advanced technological 
skills in these countries. As a result less developed countries are required to obtain 
new  technological  discoveries,  instruments,  specialist  support  and  knowledge, 
from developing countries.

 ² Obtaining support in emergencies and other disaster situations    

A country has to obtain help and support from another country in emergency 
situations.  Tsunami,  whirlwinds,  tornados,  floods,  landslides,  volcanoes  and  similar 
natural  disasters  are  a  few  exampes  of  such  situations.  In  such  situations  countries 
come forward to provide humanitarian assistance only if they have built up positive 
international relations.

 ² Development of political, economic, social and cultural relations    

International  relations  are  important  in  developing  various  political 
ideologies,  economic  policies,  social  and  cultural  relationships  followed  by 
countries. While friendship among these countries are improved through this they 
volunteer to provide support services like foreign aids, loans and supply of various 
equipments  essential  for  social  development.  Not  only  motivation  necessary  to 
acheive  the  optimum  level  politically  but  guidance  is  also    provided.  In  certain 
occasions representation of the country internationally on behalf of certain political 
rights  and ideologies also takes place. This factor has a greater impact on developing 
international relations.

Present aspect of international relations

It seems that in the past international relations were maintained in order to 
satisfy a limited number of objectives but now international relations are formed with 
the intention of achieving various aims and objectives.

In recent times it is possible to identify how the powerful countries influence  
less powerful countries. It is a significant fact that powerful countries pose pressure 
not only economically, politically and by military force but also technologically on 
less powerful countries.

With the fall of Power Base Ideology after the World War II, an environment 
was  created  for  all  the  countries  to  maintain  a  neutral  foreign  policy.  It  can  be 
noticed  that  powerful  countries  attempt  in  various  ways  to  influence  the  less 
powerful  countries  even  in  such  a  background.  Some  such  influencing  areas  are 
given below.

 ²

International Trade

 ² Offering loans and aids

 ² Economic development

 ² Defense spheres

 ² Provision of employments

Next  we  will  examine  how  Sri  Lanka  is  influenced  by  the  international 

community on the above grounds.

The influence of international relations on Sri Lanka

When we look at the present status of international relations we can see the 
aspect that powerful countries put pressure on weaker countries. These influences can 
be identified under the spheres such as economic, political, military spheres.

Particularly, the influences put on Sri Lanka do not take uniform outlook. The 
nature of the pressure put on Sri Lanka by the world community changes with the 
nature of the government in power. However, here the influences caused on Sri Lanka 
in relation to the following grounds are discussed.

International Trade

As a low price prevails in the world market for the primary goods exported 
from Sri Lanka its import income remains at a minimum level. As some developed 
countries purchase some products of Sri Lanka and re-export them we lose a large 
sum of money that our country should get.

Because of this Sri Lanka has taken steps to get a stable price for the exports 
by forming various trade agreements with the international community. In the same 
way, agreements with regard to exporting garments have been signed in order to 
supply garments to American buyers.

However,  since  some  trade  agreements  have  been  abolished  during  the  past 
period a certain amount of pressure is put on Sri Lanka through the international trade.

Example:- GSP+ concession

Provision of loans and grants

Provision  of  Loans  and  aids  to  Sri  Lanka  by  the  donor  countries  put  
great pressure on Sri Lanka. As an example, we can show that in issuing loans 
and aids various conditions are imposed on Sr Lanka by the donor countries. 
These conditions are imposed not only by the powerful countries but by various 
international financial institutions as well.

As  examples  World  Bank,  International  Monetary  Fund  can  be  stated. 

Some such conditions are given below.

130

For free distribution

131

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ² Employment of the loan or aid on the nominated project only

 ² A short duration of time is given for interest payment and repayment of the loan.

 ² Physical/human resources of the donor country are utilized in the relevant   
  project.

Economic sphere

In handling its economic activities Sri Lanka faces severe problems during 
certain  periods  of  time.  Particularly,  the  abolishing  of  the  apparel  quota  system, 
rising prices of fuel oil are significant among them. In such situations Sri Lanka has 
to make a greater effort to maintain stability of the economy. Specially obtaining 
loans and aids, issuing of treasury bonds, raising bank interest rates are some of 
them. In such situations the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and Government Treasury 
perform a commendable service. 

National Security

A  country  has  to  make  a  great  effort  to  maintain  its  national  security. 
Specially, during the time of civil war Sri Lanka made a greater effort for its 
national  security.  Here  advanced  technical  knowledge  and  military  equipments 
have to be obtained from developed countries. Maintenance of national security is 
challenged when weapons are supplied unofficially to terrorist groups; weapons are 
sold  to  the  country  at  higher  prices  and  even  when  those  countries  avoid  giving 
military specialist knowledge to the country. National security should be established 
internally as well as externally. Therefore the three military forces and the police 
should be kept alert.

Provision of employments

Middle  East  and  South  Korea  enjoy  an  important  place  in  creating  a  job 
market for Sri Lanka. It generates a large sum of foreign exchange for the country 
and make a great contribution to the economy of Sri Lanka.

However, in obtaining the labourers for the job market some countries 
pose a greater influence on Sri Lanka by placing restriction on the number of jobs 
supplied,  imposing  minimum  qualifications  for  the  jobs,  imposing  conditions 

132

For free distribution

For free distribution

133

 
 
 
 
on the remittances of their earnings as well as torture and ill treatment on the 
labourers. Yet many countries have built up the job market under very friendly 
relationships.

Regional Organizations

When we discuss about international organizations we should pay attention 
to  another  sub  category  of  international  organizations  operating at regional level. 
These organizations are formed based on geographical regions that can be seen in the 
world. For example, we can identify several such organizations by studying the world 
map given below.

Further  we  can  also  identify  the  existence  of  sub  regions  within  these 
geographical regions. As an example we can state the existence of South Asian 
sub geographical region within the Asian geographical region. We can see how regional 
organizations  are  established  within  such  sub  regions.  These  organizations  are  also 
recognized by the common name as Regional Organizations.

When we pay attention to how regional organizations are formed we see 

that they have been established on two main objectives. They are,

 ² Regional organizations based on military objectives

 ² Regional Organizations based on economic cooperation

Next we will discuss about regional organizations established on military 

objectives.

After the World War II many countries in the world were unified around two 
main power bases. Those are, power base headed by United States of America and 
the other is the power base headed by the Soviet Union.

Based  on  these  two  power  bases  regional  organizations  were  formed 
on  military  objectives.  Accordingly,  the  first  regional  military  organization 
established was the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The main reason 
for the establishment of NATO was to establish the collective security of the West 
European countries.

Subsequently, Warsaw Treaty Organization was established by the countries 
headed  by  Soviet  Union  for  the  protection  of  the  East  European  countries.  The 

132

133

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
main reason for the establishment of Warsaw Treaty Organization was to retaliate 
any invasions posed by the NATO organization. However, with the fall of the East 
European Bloc headed by Soviet Union, the Warsaw Treaty Organization, too, was 
abolished and now only NATO operates.

In recent times, in World Politics, we can see a trend of establishing 
regional organizations based on economic objectives. Particularly, formation 
of  state  organizations  based  on  these  objectives  was  originated  in  Europe  for  the 
first time. The European Economic Community formed in 1957 was the first regional 
organization established for the purpose of economic cooperation. After that, European 
Union and Latin American Free Trade Association were formed.

In the Asian Region ASEAN or Association of South East Asian Nations was 
established in 1967. Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum was established in 
1989. South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC) was established 
in 1985 by the South Asian countries on economic and social activities of the region. 
Next we will study about SAARC organization.

SAARC Organization

The organization which was established by the Countries belonging to South 
Asian  Region  is  identified  as  SAARC  organization  or  South Asian Association  for 
Regional Co-operation. This organization was established for the economic cooperation 
of the countries in the South Asian region. There are 8 countries which belong to the 
SAARC organization. Given below is the map showing those countries.

Except Afghanistan  the  other  countries  got  the  membership  at  the  time  of  its 
establishment.  Afghanistan  which  is  the  latest  member  of  the  organization 
obtained the membership recently.

The  leaders  of  the  member  countries  put  their  signature  to  the  SAARC 
Charter on the 08th of December 1985 at Dhaka in Bangladesh. The Charter was 
signed in Dhaka in Bangladesh in memory of the former Bangladesh leader Ziaur 
Rahman  who  was  assassinated  while  he  was  taking  initiatives  to  establish  this 
organization.

Objectives of the SAARC Organization

 ² Promoting the welfare of the people of South Asia and to improve their    
  quality of life.

 ² Accelerate economic growth, social progress and cultural development in    

the region.

 ² Provide all individuals the opportunity to live in dignity and to realize their  

full potential.

 ² Promote and strengthen collective self-reliance among the countries of  
  South Asia.

 ² Contribute to mutual trust, understanding and appreciation of problems of    
  one another.

 ² Promote active collaboration and mutual assistance in the economic, social, 

cultural, technical and scientific fields.

 ² Strengthen cooperation with other developing countries.

 ² Strengthen cooperation among themselves in international forums on matters  
  of common interest.

Functions of the SAARC Organization

SAARC Charter states that the Heads of State or Government shall meet 
once a year or more often as and when considered necessary by the Member States. 
The  highest  committee  of  this 
organization  is  the  Meeting  of 
Heads  of  States.  Other  than  that 
there are the Council of Ministers 
and  the  Standing  Committee  of 
Foreign Secretaries. The SAARC 
Secretariat which coordinates and 
monitors  the  implementation  of 
SAARC activities was established 
in Kathmandu.

Present status of the SAARC Organization

When  we  compare 
with  the  other  international 
and  regional  organizations 
we  cannot  see  any  strong 
the 
relationships 
among 
the 
member  countries  of 
SAARC  Organization. 
It 
is  quite    essential  for  any 
country  to  take  measures  for 
the  promotion  of  sectors  like 
agricultural 
development, 
exports, cultural activities, sports, health activities, welfare facilities. Main reason for 
this is that all the SAARC countries are developing countries. In the same manner 
internal  political  conflicts  and  also  war  situations  are  common  problems  faced  by 
many of the member countries. It has become quite essential for the member countries 
to make extra effort to control the drug menace and terrorist groups.

Fig 5.7 - SAARC Summit

The  member  states  should  take  steps  to  create  a  free  market  among  the 
member  countries,  connect  with  the  modern  world  through  the  exchange  of 
technological  knowledge,  improve  tourism,  taking  steps  for  the  protection  of 
environmental sustainability.

In the same way it is essential to prepare programme of work to minimize natural 
disasters in order to fulfill the development targets. It is also important to pay attention to 
prepare a specific economic policy in order to protect from various influences posed by 
the western countries.

International Organizations

It is essential for us, as members of the society, to have the help and support 
of others and their cooperation in order to maintain our day to day activities. In the 
same manner it is essential for the countries of the world to get help and support as 
well as cooperation of other countries in their various activities for the fulfillment of 
their various needs and requirements. As a result of this, several countries get together 
and reach agreements through the formation of conventions in order to fulfill their 
requirements and this can be regarded as the origin of international organizations.

There  are  a  large  number  of  international  organizations  in  the  world. 
Through them each and every country gets mutual support and benefits. Specially, 
the United Nations Organization (United Nations) fulfills a great service to every 
member country. Here you will get the opportunity of understanding the functions 
of the United Nations and its affiliated institutions as well as several other regional 
organizations.

The United Nations (UN)

With the end of the Second World War, the United Nations Organization was 
established in order to prevent the occurrence of another World War because a large 
number of human lives were destroyed, a large number of people were disabled and 
became  handicapped.  Inestimable  amount  of  property  was  destroyed  in  this  war. 
Therefore,  the  world  leaders  paid  attention  to  prevent  countries  going  into  such  a 
destructive state of   another war again.  The United States of America, Great Britain 
and  Soviet  Russia,  and  other  leading  countries  of  the  time  took  the  initiative. As 
a result of this in 1945, a conference was held in the city of San Francisco in the

this international organization. The United Nations Convention was ratified by the 
countries after signing it on 26th of June 1945.

Objectives of the United Nations

 ² To promote world peace and protection

 ² To promote better relations among countries

 ² To support in conflict resolution in social, economic, humane and cultural

148

word  “British”  was  dropped  and  was  identified  by  the  name  “Commonwealth”. 
In 1911 Great Britain held a Conference called Empire Conference to discuss the 
common problems faced by countries which belong to its Empire. Subsequently, in 
1944 the Common Wealth was established with the membership of countries which 
were former colonies of the British Empire.

However, the Durham Commission Report of 1839 influenced the birth 
of the Common Wealth. It is not necessary for all the former colonies which 
obtained  independence  to  get  the  membership  of  the  Commonwealth.  The 
leader of the Common Wealth is the King or Queen of Britain.

Media of international relations

Countries of the world maintain relations in various ways. Specially, through 
peaceful  relationships  as  well  as  warfare  relationships  international  relations  are 
built up.

International  community  performing  within  peaceful  relations  is  highly    
favourable. Then it develops mutual trust and corporation and it leads to minimize  
conflicts.

Next  we  will  consider  several  main  media  through  which  international 

relations are maintained.

1. Diplomatic Service

The  main  media  through  which  international  relations  are  maintained 
peacefully  is  Diplomatic  service.  The  role  played  by  the  diplomatic  service  in 
developing international relations is great. While maintaining the foreign policy 
strongly international objectives are fulfilled through the diplomatic service.

A  country  may  build  up  official  relationships  with  another  country  and 
also with organizations and persons through the diplomatic service. Here the state 
carries out its foreign policies through diplomats and state missions or emissaries.

The ambassadors of countries that belong to the Commonwealth is called 
as  the  High  Commissioner.  For  example,  the  Indian  Embassy  in  Sri  Lanka  is 
identified as the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka.

The functions of the Ambassadors and the Emissaries

 ²

Implement the foreign policy of the country

 ² Safeguard the expectations of the citizens of his country

 ² Deliver the messages of one’s own country to other countries

 ² Understand the policies of one’s own country

 ² Create a good image about one’s own country

 ²

Improve friendship among countries

 ² Develop political, social, economic and intellectual  relationships

 ² Represent one’s own country and the leader of one’s own country

The qualities of the Ambassadors and the Emissaries

 ² Act with proper understanding of one’s profession, rules and regulations, 

strategies and ethics.

 ² Have proper understanding about one’s own country as well as the country  

that one serves in and the nature of the world politics.

 ² Knowledge about state strategies, Arbitration, Conciliation and Negotiation.

 ² Utilize international rules and regulations and international political trends for  

the benefit of one’s own country.

2. International Trade

We  have  discussed  that  no  country  in  the  world  can  produce  all  the 
things that country needs within that country itself. As a result import and export 
activities take place among countries.

For  example,  Sri  Lanka  exports  tea  while  the  United  States  of America                   

exports wheat flour.

International Trade takes place in two ways. 

1.Bilateral Trade

2.Multilateral Trade

Bilateral Trade means the transactions take place between two countries 
only. As an example, Sri Lanka exports rubber to China while China exports rice 
to Sri Lanka. When carrying out bilateral trade the two countries have to come to             
agreements between them.

Multilateral Trade

The trade that takes place among more than two countries is called Multilateral 
Trade. The specific feature that can be seen in Multilateral Trade is, the value of the 

152

153

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
goods imported from one country to another can be settled with the value of the 
goods exported to that country. Assume that Sri Lanka imports milk powder from 
New Zealand and exports garments to USA.

       Sri Lanka           

 Export

Garments

 USA

 Sri Lanka 

Import

Milk Powder

    New Zealand

In the above transaction the amount that should be paid to New Zealand for 
the import of milk powder can be instructed to be paid with the income from the 
USA for the Garments exported to that country. In that situation New Zealand can 
import another good or service from the USA for that value.

Powerful Currencies used in international Trade

- American Dollars

- Sterling Pound

- Euro

- Japan Yen

International Organizations associated with International Trade

- The European Free Trade Association

- UNCTAD Organization

- GATT Organization

- International Monetary Fund

Activity 5.2

 ² Select two international organizations associated with internatinal trade 
and  arrange  the  information  under  the  headings  such  as  membership, 
objectives, etc.

War

War  can  be  considered  as  a  another  way  that  international  relations  are 
maintained. This is not a peaceful media of maintaining international relations. A 
conflicting situation that arises between two or more parties can simply be identified 
as  war.  (This  has  been  greatly  discussed  in  Chapter  V  of  Grade  10  Citizenship 
Education Text Book). The best example for war situation between countries can 
be stated as the two World Wars. Armed struggle that prevailed in Sri Lanka can be 
stated as a civil war which took place within a country.

Due to war, international relations are threatened. Refugees are a result of 
wars.  International  relations  can  be  damaged  due  to  people  migrating  from  one 
country to another as refugees. However, some countries voluntarily allow refugees 
to enter their territories.

It  is  also  necessary  to  obtain  donations  and  aid  for  the  restoration  of                    
property and other resources destroyed by war. If this does not happen countries 
affected by war would become helpless.

Strengthening of international relations is essential in order to establish 
and maintain national security. It is quite indispensible for countries which are 
subjected to internal and external risks of war to seek International Cooperation 
for their national security.

Foreign Aid

Existence of strong international relations is essential for the provision of 
foreign  aid. Aid  is  given  by  the  developed  countries  as  well  as  those  countries 
which are in a position to provide aid. As an example, the assistance provided by 
India for the Northern Region railway line development projects can be stated.

Foreign  aid  is  given  to  developing  countries  for  the  improvement  of             
areas  such  as  large  scale  heavy  industries,  development  of  infrastructure 
facilities, welfare services and other economic sections.

Activity 5.3

 ² Select three countries and three organizations which provide foreign aid. 
List separately how each of these countries and organizations performed 
their services to Sri Lanka.

Peace

Prevalence of peace in a country brings happiness to all. Peace is essential 
not only for the protection of human rights but also for the progress of economic, 
social,  cultural,  political  aspects  of  a  country. All  the  citizens  should  work  with 
responsibility for the maintenance of peace in the country. Peace can be developed 
if we work without being divided on any narrow communal, religious basis or any 
other grounds. Such a situation does not give way to conflict. The United Nations 
which was formed for the purpose of creating world peace renders a great service 
for the protection of peace.

Development

When  peace  is  established  in  a  country  development  takes  place 
automatically. A country which does not experience peace have to spend a large 
amount of money to maintain the armed forces of the country, to purchase weapons, 

156

157

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to  look  after    refugees,  persons  dying  at  war  or  the  disabled  and  to  reconstruct 
the  destroyed    property.  Since  a  large  amount  of  the  National  Income  is  spent 
on the   areas mentioned above, the amount of money that is allocated for other     
development work takes a minimum value. As a result of this, the development of 
the country is hampered by it or will completely break down.

Therefore, a country in which peace prevails, the money spent on war can 
be utilized to achieve development targets. Then economic and social development  
accelerates. New job opportunities are generated. Purchasing power of the people 
increases.  A  quality  living  condition  is  created.  It  generates  new  investment 
opportunities and the entire economy becomes strong.

Effects of building up international relations

Following benefits can be achieved by building up international relations.

 ² Develops international friendship. Due to this all the states follow a friendship  

policy. Give help and support in emergency situations.

 ² New job opportunities are created.

 ² Mutual help is given in emergency situations.

 ² New technological knowledge can be exchanged.

 ² Support will be given on development activities.

Being innovative, changing with right knowledge
Be a light to the country as well as to the world.

Message from the Hon. Minister of Education

The past two decades have been significant in the world history due to changes that took 
place  in  technology.  The  present  students  face  a  lot  of  new  challenges  along  with  the  rapid 
development of Information Technology, communication and other related fields. The manner of 
career opportunities are liable to change specifically in the near future. In such an environment, 
with a new technological and intellectual society, thousands of innovative career opportunities 
would be created. To win those challenges, it is the responsibility of  the Sri Lankan government 
and myself, as the Minister of Education, to empower you all. 

This  book  is  a  product  of  free  education. Your  aim  must  be  to  use  this  book  properly 
and acquire the necessary knowledge out of it. The government in turn is able to provide free 
textbooks to you, as a result of the commitment and labour of your parents and elders.

Since we have understood that the education is crucial in deciding the future of a country,

world. Hence, you have to dedicate yourselves to become productive citizens. I believe that the 
knowledge this book provides will suffice your aim. 

It  is  your  duty  to  give  a  proper  value  to  the  money  spent  by  the  government  on  your 
education. Also you should understand that education determines your future. Make sure that 
you reach the optimum social stratum through education.

Foreword 

The  educational  objectives  of  the  contemporary  world  are  becoming 
more complex along with the economic, social, cultural and technological 
development.  The  learning  and  teaching  process  too  is  changing  in 
relation  to  human  experiences,  technological  differences,  research 
and  new  indices. Therefore,  it  is  required to  produce  the  textbook by 
including subject related information according to the objectives in the 
syllabus in order to maintain the teaching process by organizing learning 
experiences that suit to the learner needs. The textbook is not merely a 
learning tool for the learner. It is a blessing that contributes to obtain a 
higher education along with a development of conduct and attitudes, to 
develop values and to obtain learning experiences.

The government in its realization of the concept of free education has 
offered you all the textbooks from grades 1-11. I would like to remind 
you  that  you  should  make  the  maximum  use  of  these  textbooks  and 
protect them well. I sincerely hope that this textbook would assist you 
to  obtain  the  expertise  to  become  a  virtuous  citizen  with  a  complete 
personality who would be a valuable asset to the country.

I would like to bestow my sincere thanks on the members of the editorial 
and writer boards as well as on the staff of the Educational Publications 
Department who have strived to offer this textbook to you.

A Word to the Teacher

The Board of Writers and Editors are honored to be a part of this 
national endeavour to write and edit the Grade 11 English textbook 
and  workbook  for  the  students  of  this  country.  The  textbook  is 
designed to help the students to learn and use language in different 
situations  locally  and  internationally.  The  book  also  contains 
additional information for the teachers in the form of competency 
levels  and  the  corresponding  activities  with  the  hope  of  making 
the  task  of  teaching  easier.  Furthermore,  the  book  is  designed 
to  accommodate  the  different  and  varying  proficiency  levels  of 
the  students  with  the  hope  of  addressing  the  needs  of  the  larger 
student  population  of  this  country.  In  addition,  the  lessons  are 
chronologically sequenced to avoid any confusion that may arise in 
the teaching process. 

It is recommended that this book be used as guide to the teachers 
and  the  students  on  the  expected  national  standards  and  teachers 
are encouraged to use supplementary material as much as possible 
in the classroom. We thank all those who worked with us and hope 
that we will be able to make a difference in the lives of our students 
who are keen and enthusiastic to learn English.

1 OUR  RESPONSIBILITIES

Activity 1

 Act out

Vikum and Chamindu meet each other in the bus on their way to school.

Vikum 

- Good morning Chamindu!  The bus is crowded today. Give me  

   your school bag or would you rather sit here?

Chamindu  -  Good morning! Thank you Vikum. It’s not too far. Just keep   

  my bag.

Vikum	

-		Sure.	By	the	way,	did	you	manage	to	find	facts	for	the	debate		

  next week?

Chamindu  -  Yes. I've planned to visit the local library too.

Vikum 

-  We’ve got to propose the idea “Discipline cannot be achieved  

  only through laws”.

Chamindu  -  Yes. I’ve read some articles about it. My sister also    

   downloaded some articles from the internet. It’s quite an  

  interesting topic, isn’t it?

Vikum 

- Of course! My mother says it’s a timely topic that all school   

  children should be made aware of.

Chamindu  -  I think so too.  Discipline cannot be imposed only through laws.

Vikum 

-  Hmm… It will be an interesting debate. 

Chamindu  -  There is an article on vandalism too in my sister’s collection of  

  articles.

Vikum 

-  What’s that? I’ve never heard that word before. Can you please 

  repeat the word?

Chamindu  -  Van-da-lism.  Let’s read my sister’s articles and discuss more at  

  school.

Vikum 

-  Oh! Here comes a pregnant mother. I’ll offer my seat to her.

Activity 4

  Reading / Writing

This is the article Chamindu’s sister found on vandalism. Read it and do the 
activities that follow.

    VANDALISM  /vændəlizəm/

Vandalism is an offence that is caused 

when  a  person  deliberately  destroys, 

alters or defaces someone else's property 

without permission. It is mostly aimed at 

public  property  such  as  public  transport 

services,  bus  stops,  parks,  road  signs  and  other  public  places.  It  can  also  occur  at 

individual level too such as scratching someone’s car or distorting the information on a 

person’s website.

Among many reasons, personal attitudes and basic social problems are at the root of 

vandalism. It may occur because of a lack of meaningful activities, disciplinary problems, 

and negative feelings such as revenge, boredom, anger, and frustration. It can be the 

result  of  peer  group  pressure,  playfulness,  curiosity  and  pleasure  too. Although  most 

vandals do not have a clear motive for their acts, and may consider it as a simple act 

of fun or art. However, it is a punishable crime with imprisonment, monetary fines, or 

both as laws exist in a country to prevent vandalism.

Certain effects of vandalism are considered insignificant while others are considered 

extremely severe.  However, it is a problem that affects everyone in some way or other.

It  can  affect  one’s  family,  friends,  and  the 

community.  When  facilities,  such  as  public 

transport  services,  parks  and  public  restrooms 
are  vandalized,  it  makes  using  such  places 
unpleasant  and  demoralizing.  As  a  result  of 

vandalism,  fire  and  emergency  services  are 

affected  by  increased  workloads.  Citizens  of  a 

country pay their taxes in order to build a better 

community  for  the  future  generation.  But  when 

public property is vandalized, they are the ones 
who have to pay for the damage.   

There are different approaches that can be taken to prevent vandalism. It can be 

done by educating individuals, especially the young people about its consequences and 

nature.  Another way to prevent vandalism is to use property designs such as ceramic 

tiles  on  walls  which  are  easy  to  clean.  In  addition,  rough  textured  surfaces  where 

scrawling  with  graffiti  is  impossible, 
reduce  vandalistic  behaviour 
public  places.    An  essential  approach 

in 

to  reducing  vandalism  is  to  monitor 

the  condition  of  a  property  regularly.  

Studies  reveal  that  vandalism  carried 

out  by  individuals  of  all  ages  increases  when  people  think  they  are  left  out  from 

the society or community. Thus, involvement in community activities can encourage 

a sense of belonging and pride which will help them to respect and think positively 

about their community. Everyone should understand the duties and responsibilities 

of  a  citizen  and  decide  what  is  right  and  what  is  wrong. Therefore,  in  preventing 

vandalism, self-discipline plays a bigger role than laws.

As  you  mentioned  in  your  letter,  I’m  a  year  older  now.    I  totally  agree 
that  we  have  to  think  seriously  and  plan  our  future. We  have  to  take  the 
responsibility of our own lives. 

Kalani,  I  will  tell  you  how  I  celebrated  my  birthday.  On  my  birthday,  I 
donated  some  books  to  the  local  library.  My  parents  said  that  it  was  a 
very thoughtful deed. My father had visited the library a week before he 
organized this for me. We were given a list of books that they needed. In 
fact, the librarian had been waiting for a long time to get those books for 
the library.  We were happy to donate some of them. I went with my mother 
to purchase the books. On my birthday, we went to church in the morning 
and then delivered the books to the library. I felt happy as I did something 
useful on my birthday this year.   You know what? My brother has already 
made similar plans for his birthday too.

So Kalani, how are things going on for you? Hope you are having a fantastic 
time in Nuwara Eliya. Hope to hear from you soon. Give my regards to your 
parents.

Best Wishes,
Farah.

Activity 3

  Reading/ Writing

Read the following text and answer the questions that follow.

Water  rafting  is  an  adventurous  outdoor  team  activity.  It  is  done  in  white 
water or different degrees of rough water using an inflatable raft. This sport is 
challenging and considered to be dangerous, if the necessary safety precautions 
are not followed. This has now become a popular sport. However, it is necessary 
to  minimize  the  impact  of  this  sport  on  nature. There  should  be  a  “leave  no 
trace” policy when engaging in rafting. The sportsmen should learn to dispose 
of waste properly, leave what they find in the wilderness, respect wild life, keep 
fires small etc. 

There is another popular action sport called skydiving. This is also known as 
parachuting. Skydiving is done by jumping out of an aircraft and falling for as 
long as one safely can before opening the parachute. Once the sportsmen jump 
out of the aircraft they fall freely with the aid of gravity. The real challenge is 
to slow down the fall and reach the earth with the help of the parachute. This 
sport is practised even during the 18th century and it is said that in 1797, Andre 
Jacques Garnerin jumped from a hot air balloon with a parachute. It was the 
first incident of truly modern skydiving. In the military it is used as a back up 
safety mechanism for airmen. Many modern militaries use skydiving for troop

deployment. Wildfire fighters also parachute to reach remote sites, so that they 
can be on the ground quickly. At present, it is a well-known recreational sport. 

Surfing is done with the help of a surfboard. This is an act of riding on a wave, 
especially a sea wave. This can be challenging when the waves become rough. 
There are three major styles of surfing. This is done in natural waves as well 
as in artificial waves. This sport has developed into a number of other types, 
including skateboarding, wakeboarding, skimboarding, and windsurfing among 
others. Skateboarding is popular among teenagers. This is an action sport which 
enables riding and performing tricks on the skateboard.

Pole vaulting is a challenging sport. In this track and field event, the sportsman 
uses a long, flexible pole  as an aid to jump over a bar. Pole jumping competitions 
were known to the ancient Greeks, Cretans and Celts. The sportsman should 
have a speed of a sprinter, the flexibility of a gymnast, and the vertical jump of a 
jumper. This needs courage to jump up in the free air with a pole. The sportsmen 
need not only to jump a considerable height but also to land correctly. This has 
been a full medal event at the Olympic Games since 1896 for men and since 
2000 for women.

A) State whether the following statements are TRUE or FALSE.

1. Water rafting is an outdoor sport. 
2. Skydivers do not need parachutes to land.  
3. Surfing is not a challenging sport.   
4. Surfing is done only in natural waves.

The Challenge

Blessed is the man, indeed,
Who in this life can find;
A purpose that can fill his days,
And goals to fill his mind!

The world is filled with little men
Content with here they are;
Not knowing joys success can bring,
No will to go that far!

Yet, in this world there is a need,
For men to lead the rest
To rise above the "average" life,
By giving of their best!

Would you be one, who dares to try,
When challenged by the task;
To rise to heights you've never seen,
Or is that too much to ask?

This is your day a world to win
Great purpose to achieve;
Accept the challenge of your goals
And in yourself, believe! 

You will be proud of what you've done,
When at the close of day;
You look back on your battles won,
Content, you came this way!

Kishan started practising that presentation. 

Good morning, dear teacher and my dear friends!  This presentation 
is on the irrigation system of Sri Lanka which dates back to 300 BC. We, Sri 
Lankans  are  proud  of  the  many  wondrous  water  managing  systems  of  the 
ancient	civilizations.	We	were	the	first	to	build	water	reservoirs	to	store	water	
which are known as tanks (wewa/kulam). Many Sri Lankan kings such as King 
Pandukabhaya, King Wasabha, King Mahasen, King Dhathusena, King Agbo I, 
King Agbo II and King Parakramabahu the Great built tanks to improve farming 
in Sri Lanka. The ancient kings followed the advice of the Buddhist monks and 
ruled the country. This led to the ancient concept of ‘tank and stupa’.
I’m sure that you all know the reason why these great kings built tanks. Can you 
tell me why? Well, it’s pretty obvious that the kings had a vision to cultivate the 
land	and	to	make	the	country	self-sufficient.	Now	I’ll	show	you	a	cross	section	
of a tank. 

Well,	friends	I	have	some	more	key	points	to	discuss.	I	need	your	help	to	finish	
the rest.

-  This irrigation agriculture helped in making ancient Sri Lanka a self-  

			sufficient	country

-  Sri Lankans have two seasons for farming

-  Rice, the staple food of Sri Lanka

-  Man-made lakes

-  The royal master builder of tanks was King Parakrambahu the Great   

  (1164 - 1196 AD)

-  Constructed or restored 165 dams, 3910 canals, 163 major tanks and   

    2376 minor tanks

-  Sri Lanka came to be known as the Granary of the East

4 FOR A  BETTER TOMORROW

Activity 1

 Act out

Practise this television interview.

Presenter  

:  Good  Morning!  Once  again  we  join  you  in  your  favourite 

programme “For a Better Tomorrow.” Our topic today is “Polythene and the 

Environment.,, To share some valuable ideas on this topic, we have with us one 

of the eminent environmentalists in the country, Mr. Sunil Weerasinghe. 

Welcome to the programme, Mr. Weerasinghe.

Sunil Weerasinghe 

:  Thank you. It’s a pleasure to be here.

Interviewer  

:  As we are well aware, polythene has become a major  

   environmental issue. Talking about polythene and the  

  environment, what is the biggest problem related to  

  polythene?

Sunil Weerasinghe 

:  The biggest problem is that most types of polythene  

  don’t decay. They accumulate in the environment,   

and that, in turn, creates many other problems.

Interviewer  

:  I’m sure our viewers would like to know about these  

  problems. Could you tell us something about them?

Sunil Weerasinghe 

: 

Well,  it  seems  that  a  lot  of 

people  have 

the  habit  of 

throwing 

polythene 

bags 

carelessly  and  haphazardly 

into  the  environment.  This 

often 

leads 

to  problems 

like  land  pollution  and  land 
infertility. Polythene also blocks sewage systems and water sources. Another 

problem is that rain water collected in polythene bags provides breeding grounds 

for mosquitoes. This is really unfortunate. We will be living in an extremely 

unhealthy environment if  such a situation is to continue.

Interviewer  

:  Can’t we burn polythene instead?

Sunil Weerasinghe  :  Unfortunately, that doesn’t help much. Burning  

   polythene creates a lot of harmful gases and  

  substances. They are harmful to all living things.

Interviewer  

:  How about the effect of polythene on animal life?

Sunil Weerasinghe  :  Sadly, a lot of animals die after eating polythene as it is  

  not digested.

Interviewer  

:  So, what are your suggestions? Should we stop using  

  polythene?

Sunil Weerasinghe  :  Not exactly. I think we should try to minimize the    

  use of polythene. Taking reusable bags when  

  marketing is a possible way of reducing the use of    

  polythene. Recycling polythene is another solution. 

Interviewer  

:  Reduce, reuse and recycle. We should all think about  

  it. With that thought  we come to the end of   

  our programme. Thank you for joining us today, Mr.  

  Weerasinghe.

Sunil Weerasinghe  :  Thank you for inviting me.

Interviewer

Animals on the Verge of Extinction

Polar Bears

Polar  bears  live  across  the  Arctic  in  Canada, 
Alaska, Greenland, Russia, Denmark and Norway. 
They  are  the  first  animals  to  be  threatened 
because  of  global  warming.  They  need  a  cold 
climate, snow and ice of the Arctic regions to 
survive.  When  the  snow  and  ice  in  the  polar 
regions  melt,  these  animals  lose  their  natural 
habitat. Scientists say that polar bears are in  
danger of becoming extinct in about 50 years.

Lions

Lions were wide-ranging animals. In the past,They 
wandered  freely  in  Africa,  Asia,  Europe  and 
India.  Now  they  are  confined  to  Africa  and 
to a small area in India. Loss of habitat, loss 
of  prey  and  sport  hunting  have  made  this 
majestic animal endangered.  Scientists warn 
that if these activities are to continue, African 
lions could very well be extinct by 2050.

Blue Whales

Blue  whales  live  in  all  the  oceans  except  the 
polar  seas.    They  have  become  endangered  due 
to  being  hunted  for  blubber  and  body  parts.  For 
this  reason  they  have  been  declared  protected 
animals  since  1966.  Global  warming  also  harms 
blue  whales.  Temperature  changes  in  water  due 
to global warming may induce migration to wrong 
places where food supply could be low. It is believed 
that 10000 to 25000 blue whales swim in the oceans 
of the world.

Activity 9

  Writing

Read the following article and answer the questions that follow.

Anyone who prepares for an exam will have to plan and study according to a 
timetable. What is the best time of the day to study? For some, it is the daytime 
and for some others it’s at night. However, there are some students who struggle 
to find a suitable time to study due to many reasons. 

After a good night's sleep, people tend to have more energy and become more 
active  during  the  day.  Since  most  of  the  people  are  contactable  during  the 
day, it is easy to communicate with teachers, friends and others to clarify any 
questions that you may have. Furthermore, the natural light you get during the 
day is better than the artificial light that you use at night.  

54

 For free distribution

 
On the other hand, studying during the night can also be beneficial. During the 
night, the environment is very quiet. This creates a setting to study peacefully. 
Hence, there are fewer distractions than the day time. When you study during the 
night, your creativity will increase and this in turn will help you to understand 
theories and concepts easily. Your analysing ability also will be greater. 

However, the best time to study depends on an individual's personality, nature of 
the exam, time management, the natural sleep cycle of the person, the resources 
the person has etc. 

Whatever the time you choose to study, it is important to be methodical. First, 
set a target and keep on recalling your target. Next, give yourself enough time 
to study and organize your study space. It will also be advantageous to work 
according to a timetable,  use flow charts and diagrams to concentrate on daily 
lessons,  practise  past  question  papers,  discuss  your  answers  with  others,  get 
necessary clarifications from teachers, organize study groups and associate with 
friends who have a spirit to study. You should not forget to take regular breaks, 
eat nutritious food, drink plenty of water and spend time with your family too. 
Above all, be positive and have faith in yourself. Then, no one can stop you 
from achieving your target.

Forms of Entertainment

Entertainment  is  a  performance  or  an  activity  that  provides  enjoyment  to  an 
audience.There	are	many	forms	of	entertainment.		Among	them,	films,	dramas,	
music, dancing and  opera are the most  popular. All  of these are art forms in 
which the medium of expression is different. 

A drama is a piece of writing that tells a story and is meant for performance. 
Originally,  dramas  were  meant  to  be  acted  on  stage  before  a  live  audience.
Radio and television dramas were later developments. 

A	 film	 is	 a	 similar	 art	 form,where	 a	 series	 of	 images	 creates	 the	 illusion  of 
continuous	movement	on	a	screen.	Both	dramas	and	films	provide	an	audio-
visual realistic experience to spectators who often tend to identify themselves 
with the characters.

 For free distribution

65

Music  is  another  popular  form  of  entertainment.  Music  is  considered  “the 
universal language of mankind”. That is because a piece of music has the ability 
to appeal to listeners who are not even familiar with its language or the culture. 
That is why some musicians are famous all over the world even though their 
fans may not understand the language in which they sing. 

The  rhythmic  movement  of  the  body  and  feet  to  music  is  called  dancing. 
Dancing exists in all cultures in different forms and styles.

Opera is an art form in which music, singing, drama, poetry and dancing are all 
combined	together.	Opera	can	be	defined	as	musical	drama.	This	is	a	classical	
form of entertainment preferred mostly by adults.

People  need  to  engage  in  enjoyable  activities  in  order  to  balance  their  busy 
lives. Entertainment helps people to become relaxed.  At the same time, it is not 
good to spend too much time on entertainment.We may become addicted to it 
and neglect important things such as education or work.  Maintaining a proper 
balance between work and pleasure will help us to lead a productive life.

1)	Read	the	above	article	and	complete	the	following	sentences.

What is this life if, full of care,
We have no time to stand and stare?

No time to stand beneath the boughs,
And stare as long as sheep and cows:

No time to see, when woods we pass,
Where squirrels hide their nuts in grass:

No time to see, in broad daylight,
Streams full of stars, like skies at night:

No time to turn at Beauty's glance,
And watch her feet, how they can dance:

No time to wait till her mouth can
Enrich that smile her eyes began?

A poor life this if, full of care,
We have no time to stand and stare.

Given	below	is	the	article	shown	to	Anuradha	by	Rashmika.

When  we  study  the  history  of  the  world,  we  can  see 
that many religious leaders, political leaders and social 
activists	lived	simple	lives	as	minimalists.	This	quality	
attracted  many  disciples  and    followers  around  the 
world. 

Mahathma Gandhi is considered as the Father of  the 
Nation by the Indians.  He was an inspiring philosopher 
and a leader who led a simple life.  Gandhi was actually 
born	into	an	affluent	family	and	had	a	very	privileged	
upbringing.  Gandhi accumulated little, ate the amount 
he  needed  to  eat,  dressed  simply  and  led  a  simple  stress  free  life.  He  was  a 
man who believed in being non-possessive and didn’t even own a house. When 
Gandhi died, he had less than ten personal possessions including a watch, a pair

of	spectacles,	a	pair	of	sandals	and	his	eating	bowl.		Although	some	considered	
him	to	have	died	a	pauper,	he	influenced	the	lives	of	many.	Even	today	his	way	
of life continues to inspire many others around the world.  However, at present 
it	is	believed	to	be	difficult	to	minimise	the	living	conditions	to	such	an	extent.	
One must learn to use, buy, or do things that they really ought to do rather than 
doing them just because the others do.  

Life becomes easy when one learns to reuse, 
recycle	and	give	things	away.		Self-sufficiency	
also  is  a  good  trait  of  a  person  who  leads  a 
simple life.  If one can manage his own work 
such  as  painting  one’s  room,  clearing  the 
garden  or  mending  a  shoe  etc,  it  makes  life 
easier.  In  addition  if  one  is  in  the  habit  of 
growing  fruits  and  vegetables  for  one's  own 

consumption,	that	person	saves	a	lot	of	money	for	a	worthy	cause.	A	person	
who leads a simple life is stress free and has the opportunity to live a life that is 
inspired or inspiring.

a)  Minimalists live a simple life.

The Last Wishes of Alexander the Great

The	name	of	Alexander	the	Great	(356-323	B.C.)	still	lives	in	the	legends	of	

the	East,	and	traces	of	his	swift	conquest	are	still	stamped	upon	the	fabric	
of	 Western	 Asia.	 His	 name	 is	 famous	 as	 a	 conqueror	 and	 as	 the	 King	 of	
Macedonia.		Alexander	the	Great	was	born	in	the	Pella	region	of	Macedonia	on	
July	 20,	 356	 B.C.,	 to	 King	 Philip	 II	 of	 Macedon	 and	 Queen	 Olympia.	 This	
young, dark-eyed and curly-haired prince was tutored by the great philosopher, 
Aristotle.	 Alexander	 the	 Great	 conquered	 half	 the	 known	 world	 in	 thirteen	
years.  This  ruler  swept  aside  the  mighty  armies  of  the  Persian  Empire  and 
established his rule as far as Punjab. 
Alexander	 the	 Great	 was	 far	 more	 than	 a	 general	
and  a  leader  of  armies.    His  colossal  victories 
were  followed  by  sympathetic,  understanding 
administration  and  had  won  the  loyalty  of  the 
defeated.	 Alexander,	 after	 conquering	 many	
kingdoms, was returning home. On the way, he fell 
ill.	Knowing	that	his	death	was	nearing,	he	longed	
to  see  his  mother’s  face.  However,  he  realized 
that  his  sinking  health  would  not  permit  him  to 
reach his mother as he was far from his homeland. 
Alexander	 the	 great	 realized	 that	 all	 his	 wealth	
and	his	conquests,	his	great	army,	his	sharp	sword	
would not help him to save his life.

He called his generals and said, "I will depart from this world soon, I have three 

 For free distribution

79

wishes, please carry them out without fail."
With	 tears	 flowing	 down	 their	 cheeks,	 the	 generals	 agreed	 to	 abide	 by	 their	
king's last wishes.

1)	"My	first	desire	is	that",	said	Alexander,	"my	physicians alone must carry my 
coffin."

2)	After	a	pause,	he	continued,	"Secondly,	I	desire	that	when	my	coffin	is	being	
carried  to  the  grave,  the  path  leading  to  the  graveyard  be  strewn  with  gold, 
silver and precious stones which I have collected in my treasury".

3)  The  king  felt  exhausted  after 
saying  this.  He  took  a  minute's 
rest and continued. "My third and 
last wish is that both my hands be 
kept	dangling	out	of	my	coffin".

All	 who	 were	 around	 were	 in	
tears.  But,  there  was  none  who 
was	 brave	 enough	 to	 inquire	 the	
reasons  for  the  wishes  except  for 
the	favourite	general.	As	a	reply	this	great	ruler	said,	“I	would	like	the	world	
to know of the three lessons I have just learnt. I want my physicians to carry 
my	coffin	because	people	should	realize	that	no	doctor	on	this	earth	can	really	
cure anybody. They are powerless and cannot save a person from the clutches 
of death. So let not people take life for granted. The second wish of strewing 
gold, silver and other riches on the path to the graveyard is to tell people that not 
even a fraction of gold will come with me. I spent all my life in greed for power, 
earning riches but I cannot take anything with me. Let people realize that it is a 
sheer	waste	of	time	to	chase	wealth.	About	my	third	wish	of	having	my	hands 
dangling	out	of	the	coffin,	I	wish	people	to	know	that	I	came	empty	handed	into	
this world and empty handed I go out of this world".

Leaving	these	three	important	lessons,	this	great	conqueror	let	death	conquer	
him.

  Reading

Robinson  Crusoe  has  captured  the  imagination  of  countless  readers  with  the

is thought to be one of the first English novels but it is a timeless story of a

Read the extract taken from it and do the activities that follow.

My thoughts were now wholly employed about securing myself against either 

savages, if any should appear, or wild beasts, if any were in the island; and I 

had many thoughts of the method how to do this, and what kind of dwelling to 

make - whether I should make me a cave in the earth, or a tent upon the earth; 

and, in short, I resolved upon both; the manner and description of which, it may 

not be improper to give an account of.

I soon found the place I was in was not fit for my settlement, because it was upon 

a low, moorish  ground, near the sea, and I believed it would not be wholesome, 
and more particularly because there was no fresh water near it; so I resolved to 

find a more healthy and more convenient spot of ground.

I 

consulted 

several 

things  in  my  situation, 

which  I  found  would 

be proper for me: first, 

health  and  fresh  water, 

I  just  now  mentioned; 

secondly,  shelter  from 

the  heat  of  the  sun; 

thirdly,  security  from 

ravenous 

creatures, 

whether  man  or  beast;

fourthly, a view to the sea, that if God sent any ship in sight, I might not lose 

any advantage for my deliverance, of which I was not willing to banish all my 

expectation yet.

In search of a place proper for this, I found a little plain on the side of a rising 

hill,  whose  front  towards  this  little  plain  was  steep  as  a  house-side,  so  that 

nothing could come down upon me from the top. On the one side of the rock 

there was a hollow place, worn a little way in, like the entrance or door of a cave 

but there was not really any cave or way into the rock at all.

A terrible scream—a prolonged yell of horror  and anguish—burst out of the 
silence of the moor. That  frightful  cry  turned  the  blood  to  ice  in  my veins.
“Oh, my God!” I gasped.  “What is it?  What does it mean?”

Holmes had sprung to his feet, and I saw his dark,  athletic  outline  at  the  door  
of  the  hut,  his shoulders stooping,  his head thrust forward,  his face peering 
into the darkness.

“Hush!” he whispered. “Hush!”

The cry had been loud on account of its vehemence, but it had pealed out from 
somewhere far off on the shadowy plain. Now it burst upon our ears, nearer, 
louder, more urgent than before.

“Where is it?” Holmes whispered; and I knew from the thrill of his voice that 
he, the man of iron, was shaken to the soul.

 “Where is it, Watson?”

“There, I think.” I pointed into the darkness.

“No, there!”

Again  the  agonized cry  swept  through 
the silent night, louder and much nearer 
than  ever.  And  a  new  sound  mingled 
with  it,  a  deep,  muttered  rumble, 
musical  and  yet  menacing,  rising  and 
falling like the low, constant murmur of 
the sea.

“The hound!” cried Holmes. “Come, Watson, come! Great heavens, if we are 
too late!”

He had started running swiftly over the moor, and I had followed at his heels.

But now from somewhere among the broken ground immediately in front of us 
there came one last despairing yell, and then a dull, heavy thud. We halted and 
listened. Not another sound broke the heavy silence of the windless night.

I saw Holmes put his hand to his forehead like a man distracted. He stamped his 
feet upon the ground.

“He has beaten us, Watson. We are too late.”

“No, no, surely not!”

“Fool  that  I  was  to  hold  my  hand.  And  you,  Watson,  see  what  comes  of 
abandoning  your  charge!  But,  by  Heaven,  if  the  worst  has  happened,  we’ll 
avenge him!”

Blindly  we  ran  through  the  gloom,  blundering  against  boulders,  forcing  
our    way    through  gorse  bushes,  panting  up  hills  and  rushing  down  slopes,  
heading  always  in  the  direction  when  those  dreadful  sounds  had  come. 

 At every rise Holmes looked eagerly round him, but the shadows were thick 
upon the moor, and nothing moved upon its dreary face.

Read the paragraph about Anne Frank and answer the questions.

Anne Frank was a Jewish girl who had to go into hiding during World War II 

from the Nazis. Together with seven others she hid in a secret annex. After 
almost two years in hiding they were discovered and deported to concentration 
camps.  Anne’s  father,  Otto  Frank,  was  the  only  one  of  the  eight  people  to 
survive. After her death Anne became world famous because of the diary she 
had written while in hiding.
Anne Frank was born on 12 June 1929 in Frankfurt. 
The  economic  crisis,  Hitler’s  rise  to  power  and 
growing anti-Semitism (hatred against Jews)  put an 
end to the family’s carefree life. So, following what 
most of the Jews did, they decided to leave Germany 
to save their lives.

Anne and others in hiding stayed very quietly, they 
were  often  afraid  and  despite  good  and  bad  times, 
spent  the  time  together.  They  were  helped  by  the 
office  workers  Johannes  Kleiman,  Victor  Kugler, 
Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl, by Miep's husband Jan 
Gies and warehouse boss Johannes Voskuijl, Bep's 
father.  These  helpers  arranged  food,  clothes  and 
books for them.

Shortly before going into hiding Anne received a diary for her birthday. She 
started  writing  straightaway  and  during  her  time  in  hiding  she  wrote  about 
events in the secret annex, about herself and about humanity. Her diary was a 
great support and source of relief to her. 

On 4th of August 1944 the people in hiding 
were  arrested.  They  were  deported  to 
Auschwitz. Immediately after the arrest 
Miep  Gies  and  Bep  Voskuijl  rescued 
Anne's  diary  and  papers  that  had  been 
left behind in the secret annex. Despite 
intensive  investigations  it  had  never 
been  clear  how  the  hiding  place  had 
been discovered.

Today,  people  from  all  over  the  world 
learn  of  Anne  Frank's  story.  Over  the 
years Otto Frank answered thousands of letters from people who had read his 
daughter's diary. In 1960 the Anne Frank House became a museum. Otto Frank 
remained involved with the Anne Frank House and campaigns for human rights 
until his death in 1980.

Read the following text and answer the questions that follow. 

What can you say about the pictures shown above? They are strange circles and 
patterns seen on farming areas/sites. These patterns are called “Crop Circles”. 
The circles are mostly found in the United Kingdom, but have spread to dozens 
of countries around the world during the past decades. 

It  is  said  that  crop  circles  appear  every  week  somewhere  around  the  world. 
These circles are considered mysterious since the strange circles and patterns 
appear	mysteriously	overnight	in	farmers'	fields,	provoking	puzzlement. These 
patterns almost always involve circles, rarely triangles, rectangles, or squares, 
though some designs contain straight or curved lines. 

Nobody	knows	how	they	are	made,	who	brought	them	to	the	farming	fields.	
Some  believe  that  this  can  be  a  creation  of  hoaxers.  But,  mysteriously  this 
nocturnal  act  is  reported  to  be  insensitive  to  cameras.  Besides,  hoaxers  who 
devote their time and effort required to design and create the crop circles are 
unlikely to carelessly leave obvious signs of their activities. Some believe that 
these patterns are made by aliens. 

In	1966	a	farmer	said	he	saw	a	flying	saucer	rise	up	from	a	swampy	area	and	fly	
away.	Later	he	had	seen	a	roughly	circular	area	of	debris	and	apparently	flattened	
reeds  and  grass.  He  assumed  that  it  had  been  made  by  the  alien  spacecraft. 
However, this was refused by the investigators who stated that this could have 
been caused by a natural phenomenon.

SETTING YOUR PERSONAL GOALS
If you want to live a happy life, tie it to a goal. Not to people or things”

Albert Einstein

Setting  your  goals  is  the  process 

of  having  a  clear  vision  about  your 

ideal future, and motivating yourself 

to  turn  your  vision  into  a  reality. 

It  helps  you  to  choose  where  you 

want to go in life. When you know 

precisely what you want to achieve, 

you know where you have to focus 

your efforts. You’ll also identify the 

distractions that might lead you astray and correct them before it is too late.

First, start your process of setting personal goals by brainstorming and writing 

down what you really enjoy doing. Then evaluate each activity, narrow down 

your list and identify what you really want to do.  Make sure that the goals that 

you have set are the ones that you genuinely want to achieve, not ones that your 

parents, family, or others might want you to achieve.

Finally, break down your goals into smaller 

objectives with a clear time frame and work 

towards achieving these smaller objectives 

within  the  time  frame.  Every  time  you 

achieve  a  smaller  objective  you  will  be 

self-confident  and  motivated  to  achieve 

your lifetime goals.

■ The future perfect continuous tense is used much like the future perfect, but   
  one of the actions is likely to continue beyond the other. 

e.g.:- This is a fairly long book and I have read only half of it. In  

  fact,  by tomorrow I will have been reading it for three days.

Note- Sometimes we use Present Continuous Tense, Simple Present Tense and 

‘going to’ form to denote future actions.

e.g.:- I am practising after school with my teammates as we are

If you like to win but think you can't, 
It's almost a cinch you won't. 

If you think you'll lose, you're lost. 
For out in the world we find
Success begins with a fellow's will. 

     It's all in the state of mind. 

If you think you are outclassed, you are. 
You've got to think high to rise. 
You've got to be sure of your-self before
You can ever win the prize. 

Life's battles don't always go
To the stronger or faster man. 
But sooner or later, the man who wins
Is the man who thinks he can.

  Reading

The departure of educated or professional people to more developed 

Brain Drain 

countries

Brain drain refers to the emigration (out-migration) of knowledgeable, well-

educated  and  skilled  professionals  from  their  home  country  to  another 
country. This  can  take  place  due  to  several  factors. The  most  obvious  is  the 
availability of better job opportunities in the new country. Other factors that can 
cause brain drain include: war or conflict, health risks, and political instability.
Brain  drain  occurs  most  commonly  when  individuals  leave  less  developed 
countries  with  fewer  opportunities  for  career  advancement,  research,  and 
academic  employment  and  migrate  to  more  developed  countries  with  more 
opportunities. However, it also occurs in the movement of individuals from one 
developed country to another developed country.

A  country  that  experiences  brain  drain  faces 
many problems. In less developed countries, this 
phenomenon is much more common and the loss is 
much more substantial. There can be an economic 
loss  for  the  country  as  educated  professionals 
leave for better salaries elsewhere. In addition, the 
development of the country is affected when most 
of the educated individuals do not use their knowledge for the benefit of their 
own country.

The loss that occurs in more developed countries is not felt much because these 
countries  generally  see  an  emigration  of  these  educated  professionals  along 
with an immigration of other educated professionals.

There are many things governments can do to combat brain drain. If there is an 
increase in job advancement opportunities and research opportunities in one’s 
own country, we can reduce the brain drain. The process is difficult and it takes 
time to establish these sorts of facilities and opportunities, but it is possible, and 
is becoming increasingly necessary. If we encourage highly-skilled workers to 
serve their own country, they will not seek better opportunities elsewhere.

1.1  Introduction to a business plan

"  Failing to plan is planning to fail"

The  above  statement  shows  the  importance  of  planning  with  regard  to  success 
in the field of Management. A plan is essential for success in anything. In Grade 
10, you studied how to select a business opportunity through various methods of 
assessment. Now you should prepare to start up and implement your business. In 
fact, drawing up a plan to transform a business idea into a real business is a main 
function of an entrepreneur. This chapter will give you a basic understanding of 
what business plans are.

The following activity will help you check your understanding of business plans.

          Activity 01

Read the given statements and indicate whether they are true (a) or false (r).

No.

Statement

a/ r

01 Every person and organization has certain targets to accomplish.

02 Every business that is started will be successful.

03 The only way to be successful in a business is to put in a lot of 

money. 

04 Business plans should be modified according to the changes in 

05

06

the environment. 
If you want to assess how a business is performing, you need a 
plan. 
In  business  planning,  you  cannot  be  sure  of  the  predictions 
regarding the external environment.

07 As the factors of the environment keep on changing, preparing 

business plans is not necessary.

08 A plan is necessary to succeed in any goal.

Before making a business plan, you should study 
the  business  environment  well.  If  you  prepare 
your business plan that way, it would guide you 
to succeed in your business through using limited 
resources and suitable strategies. If not, you may 
not achieve your goals and the resources could 
be wasted as well.

Figure 1.1 

Your school is an educational institution where various plans are being implemented. 
You would have seen the Year Planner in the main office of your school. It is a plan 
that  includes  the  activities  scheduled  by  your  school  for  the  relevant  year. Your 
class time table is another example for a plan.

A business plan is a formal document that presents, in a structured 
and well-organized manner, the targets you expect to reach and the 
various activities that you will carry out at the start-up of a business 
and while running the business. 

Based on this description, you can verify your answers for the Activity 01. 

1.2  Composition of a business plan

There  are  several  elements  of  a  business  plan.  Out  of  them,  let  us  focus  on  the

Let us take a brief look at each of them.

01. Executive summary

The executive summary is a summary of the entire business plan. It summarizes 
the most important information regarding the business for the benefit of the reader.

When a person reads the executive 
summary,  he/she  should  be  able 
to  create  a  mental  picture  of  the 
business based on the information 
presented  there.  The  executive 
summary  is  usually  about  one 
page in length. 

Figure 1.3

The following information is summarized in an executive summary:

 The name of the business, the industry that it belongs to, etc. (described very briefly)
The name of the business that the entrepreneur wishes to start and information 
regarding the nature of the business.

bank loan to expand an existing business or to manage the future activities 
in a methodical way through a self-investment should be included.

After the executive summary, the very next page should have a detailed description 
giving general information regarding the business. It will give information about 
the business and its owner or owners.

02.  Marketing plan

This section details how the sales targets will be achieved. The following forecasted 
information has to be included here: the goods or service expected to be sold, the 
demand for the goods or service, marketing strategies, sales expenditure and sales 
income.

01. To make the business idea clear

A business plan gives details about the proposed goods or service to be
offered and its uniqueness, to the persons who are interested of the business.

02. To understand the business environment

Business environment keeps on changing all 
the time. Changes occur in the internal 
environment of a business, as well as in the 
external environment including economic,  
social, political and technological and the 
natural environment. All of these changes can 
be identified early through business planning. 

03. To guide the business

business.

04. To indicate the future direction of the business

The business plan clarifies what status the business should achieve in future.

05. To raise the necessary funds

Investors prefer to put their money into profitable ventures. A business plan 
displays the proposed activities and expected benefits of the business. A 
business plan is essential for organizations such as banks when making 
investment-related decisions.

06. To make a good estimate of the demand

The market demand is a main factor determining the success or failure of a 
business. It is necessary to be well aware of the competitors and substitutes, as 
well as their market share and strategies; and to form suitable strategies to
face them. All of these require planning.

2.1  Introduction to a marketing plan 

A marketing plan can be identified as the basis of the entire business plan. This is 
because all other parts of a business plan will be prepared based on the information 
of the marketing plan, such as customer needs of the target market and quantity of 
units in demand.

The  marketing  plan  explains  what  goods  or  service  an  entrepreneur  expects  to 
offer, its potential market and the related marketing strategies. It also includes the 
projected sales for the product and the sales expenses to be incurred.

Marketing plan is the document that presents the goods or service that is expected 
to be marketed by an enterprise, its target market, and how the target market will 
be reached.

The following information is included in a marketing plan:

  Market analysis
  Marketing strategies of the proposed business
  Sales forecast
  Sales income and sales expenses
  Marketing Fixed Assets

Let us examine each of them briefly.

2.2  Market analysis

A market analysis refers to exploring the market in relation to the business. It deeply 
investigates the demand for the goods or service, the target customers, the nature of 
the competitors and their marketing strategies, etc. This will help the entrepreneur 
understand  the  factors  that  he/she  should  consider  when  deciding  on  marketing 
strategies for his/her business.

The  main  purpose  of  a  market  analysis  is  to  get  the  necessary  information  to 
prepare an accurate marketing plan. Therefore, a market analysis is the first step of 
preparing a marketing plan.

Obtaining information for a market analysis

Information needed for a market analysis can be gathered through different means. 
Given below are some of the methods used often for this purpose:

 Distributing questionnaires among customers and getting their responses
 Interviewing customers
 Observering customers’ transactions in the market
 Using sources such as newspapers, magazines, reports, internet etc.

Important factors in a market analysis

1. The demand for the goods or service 

What the entrepreneur expects to offer to the market may be something 
that is already available in the market. If not, it could be a modified version 
of something that is already available, or something entirely new. Whatever 
it is, it is necessary to examine the customers’ willingness to buy it as well 
as their ability to buy it.

2. Target customer

This refers to the customers who we can expect to buy the product, or who 
we can expect to be persuaded to buy it in future.

Let us identify the target customer through the following examples:

Goods/ service

Exercise books 
Gold Jewelry  
Preparatory  material  for  Grade  5 
Scholarship examination
Mobile phone repairing
Sports goods

Target customer

School students
Ladies
Students of Grades 4 and 5

Mobile phone users
Sportspersons

An entrepreneur must identify his/her target customer correctly. This can be done in 
a very specific manner by considering factors such as the customer’s age, income 
level, gender, occupation, social status, etc.

3. Competitors

The same kind of goods or services can be offered to the market by many 
different suppliers. The other suppliers who provide goods or services that 
are similar to those that we offer are our competitors. There are many 
varieties of toothpaste, soap, chocolates, telecommunication services, etc 
available on the market under different brand names, and these are examples 
for competitive goods and services.

In addition to such homogeneous products, there can be substitute goods/ services as well.

Given below are some examples for substitute goods/ services.

Goods/ Services

Laundry soap
Butter
Western medicine
Cab services
Tea

Substitute
Laundry powder (washing powder)
Margarine
Ayurvedic medicine
Three wheelers
Coffee

Therefore,  when  studying  competition,  it  is  important  that  you  consider  the 
homogeneous  products  (i.e.  goods  and  services  which  are  similar  to  yours),  as 
well as substitute products. In addition, you should pay attention to the marketing 
strategies used by your competitors. 

           Activity 01

Select  several  goods  and  services  available  in  the  market.  Write  down  some 
homogeneous products and substitute products for each of them.

2.3  Marketing strategies of the proposed business

By  exploring  the  market,  the  entrepreneur  can 
understand  the  marketing  strategies  used  by  the 
competitors.  Then  the  entrepreneur  has  to  select 
strategies  for  his/her  own  business,  so  that  it 
can  face  the  competition  successfully.  Selection 
of  marketing  strategies  should  be  based  on  the 
marketing mix. There are four main variables of 
the marketing mix, which are also known as the 
4 Ps: Product, Price, Place and Promotion. Given 
below is a short description of the 4 Ps. 

Product

Figure 2.1 

Price

Place

Products refer to goods or services offered to the market which can satisfy 
the customer needs or wants. 

This involves information regarding the product such as its content, 
ingredients, shape, quality, size, brand name, instructions for use, etc.

The cost incurred by the customer when obtaining a product is called its 
price. This is a main factor that determines the demand for the goods as well 
as the profit earned by the entrepreneur.

Pricing strategies, how the prices are to be set, any discounts to be given etc 
are considered here.

This refers to how the goods or service will reach the target customer.  
Different strategies can be used to make the goods/service available to 
the customers. For example, the entrepreneur may sell the goods directly to 
the customer, or through retail traders. If not, the entrepreneur can sell the 
goods to the wholesale trader, who sells them to the retail trader, who in turn 
sells them to the customer.

Out of all such strategies, the most suitable one/s should be considered to
make the product available to the customer.

Promotion

Businesses use various strategies to create a demand for their goods 
or services, to increase the existing demand and to attract the customers. 
These strategies are called promotion.

The following are some possible means of promoting a product.

                   Television, radio, newspapers, 
        banners, leaflets, posters

                        Methods involving new technology, 
      such as promotions over Websites, 
      Facebook, etc

                 Using mobile SMS

Figure 2.2

     Meeting the customers in person

                Organizing charity programmes and artistic or cultural events 

As described above, the marketing plan should include the promotional strategies 
for attracting the customers and retaining their loyalty for the product.

2.4  Sales forecast

A  sales  forecast  refers  to  determining  the 
quantity of goods or services to be marketed 
within  a  provided  period  of  time  in  future. 
After analyzing the market, the entrepreneur 
can  understand  the  demand  for  his/her 
product within the target market. There may 
be a large market for the product.

An entrepreneur may not cover the entire market demand at the time of starting up 
the business. Depending on the strength of his/her business, the entrepreneur can 
forecast the unit of sales of the market share.

Example :- 

The demand for a certain product is 15 000 units per week. The 
current competitors provide only 12 000 units. Therefore, there is a 
market gap for 3 000 units. It is the new entrepreneur who should 
decide whether he/she can supply all 3 000 units or only a part of it.

When making a sales forecast, the expected quantity of sales can be calculated per 
day, per week, per month, per trimester, per year, etc. It would facilitate the decision 
making. The forecasted market share should be included in the marketing plan.

Marketing expenses

All  expenses  incurred  in  marketing  the  goods  or  service  are  taken  under  sales 
expenses.

Example :- 

Salaries and wages for Marketing managers and staff

Expenses related to sales outlets (if any), such as rental, maintenance, 
electricity, water, insurance, etc

Office expenses such as telephone charges, stationery, etc

Publicity and promotion-related expenses

Depreciation expenses - based on the lifetime of a fixed asset such 
as sales vehicles, office equipment, a portion of its value should be 
deducted in the form of an expense. This is called depreciation.

As  indicated  above,  the  forecasted  data  regarding  the  total  sales  income  and 
expenditure should be included in the marketing plan. 

2.6  Marketing fixed assets

These  are  the  fixed  assets  that  are  directly  relevant  to  the  sales  and  distribution 
activities of the business. 

Example :- 

Land and buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles, office tools and 
furniture, etc. which are used in sales and distribution-related activities

2.7  Preparing a marketing plan 

To  further  clarify  the  concepts  discussed  above,  let  us  study  a  marketing  plan 
prepared for the following scenario. 

After having considered a number of business ideas, Akila Jayawardene 
finally decided to manufacture yoghurt.

He thought of starting the business targeting his own town, Araliya, in 
Rathnapura. Given below is the information he found from studying the 
market for yoghurt in the area:

Population in Araliya  40 000 citizens

5% of the population eat yoghurt every day. At present, 75% of the yoghurt 
sold in the market is dairy yoghurt and 25% is fruit yoghurt.

Akila  understood  that  50%  of  the  demand  for  yoghurt  in  the  area  was 
fulfilled by external companies and 50% by two local manufacturers.

Therefore he decided to capture 10% of the market share in the first year 
of business. The following strategies were selected.

Product: dairy yoghurt and fruit yoghurt 

Price : competitive market price

Place : selling through retail traders and restaurants, and selling from 
the place of manufacture

Promotion: displaying posters at the outlets, offering stickers for children

A three-wheeler worth Rs. 480 000 will be bought to distribute yoghurt. 

Other expected expenses are given below:

   Annual depreciation of the three-wheeler - Rs. 4 800 

   Annual insurance premium of the three-wheeler - Rs. 4 800

   Monthly fuel and service expenses - Rs. 7 200

   Monthly salary for sales staff – Rs. 10 000 

   Monthly expense for printing posters – Rs. 1 500

   Monthly expense for printing stickers – Rs. 2 000

Distribution of yoghurt will take place five days a week. The market price 
of a cup of yoghurt is Rs. 30. There is no difference in price between dairy 
yoghurt and fruit yoghurt.

           Activity 03

Sasmitha decided to start a business of manufacturing and selling sweets. She 
visited several restaurants in the area to find out about the sweets available 
for sale and the demand for them.

Based on the information given by the restaurant owners, she understood that 
there were many who manufactured sweets using wheat flour. However, there 
were only a few who manufactured sweets out of rice flour and kurakkan flour.

Through a market analysis, she understood that a considerable number of 
people,  being  diabetic,  were  starting  to  use  rice  flour  and  kurakkan  flour. 
Given below is some information that she has collected:

Her hometown, Jayagama in Akuressa, has a population of around 80 000
citizens

20% of the population like food made of kurakkan flour and rice flour

They wish to buy sweets at least once in two days

The main competitors and their market shares are as follows:

‘Vimansi Sweets’ – 30%
‘Arundathi Sweets’ – 35%

The marketing strategies of the competitors –

Ensuring the taste and hygienic quality
Distributing once per two days and having the unsold items returned to them
Displaying sales posters near shops that sell sweets

Sasmitha decided to start up the business covering 25% of the market. She 
will be using the same marketing strategies as her competitors. In addition, 
she decided to circulate flyers giving information about her products.

3.1 Introduction to a production plan

A production plan is another important element in a business plan. A production 
plan is prepared with the aim of calculating the production cost and the cost per one 
unit of the product. 

You have already studied the marketing plan. There, the entrepreneur estimated the 
quantity of goods or services that he/she expects to sell. The next step is estimating 
the cost for producing that quantity of goods or services. This requires a production 
plan.

When producing any good or service, it is necessary to incur a cost. For instance, 
think  of  your  exercise  books. When  producing  exercise  books,  you  will  initially 
need paper, stapler pins and printed covers. You will also need machinery for cutting 
up and binding the books. In addition, you need employees to do all the work.

All  of  these  result  in  some  cost.  When  a  large  quantity  of  goods  or  services  is 
produced, you will need more material and more workers, and the cost will increase 
as  well.  Therefore,  a  proper  production  plan  must  be  prepared,  taking  all  the 
expenses into account.

A production plan is the document estimating the cost for a number of production 
units.

3.2 Production process

Production  process  describes  how  the  goods  or  service  will  be  produced.  This 
includes  details  on  what  kind  of  input  will  be  used,  what  changes  will  be  made 
to the input, and what the final product will be. Here, input refers to the resources 
needed to produce some goods or service.

Let us try to understand the production process through the following example on 
how to make a cup of tea. 

Process of conversion
Put the water in to the kettle and boil

Output 

Wash the utensils

Put milk powder and sugar into the jug and mix well

Put the tea leaves into a jug and add boiled water

Strain  off  the  tea  leaves  to  the  jug  where  the  milk 
powder and sugar and stir well

Strain  the  milk  tea  into  the  cup  which  has  been 
washed

Tea leaves
Milk powder
A teapot
A gas burner

Similarly, there is a production process for any product, indicating the relationship 
between the input and the output. This can be displayed as follows:

3.3 Production fixed assets

Buildings, machinery, equipment etc that are used for long term, again and again in 
the production process are known as production fixed assets.

3.4 Production cost

Production  cost  refers  to  the  total  cost  incurred  for  material,  labour  and  other 
expenses (production overheads) during the production of a product.

Production cost = material + labour + other expenses

Let us look at each of these separately.

Material and  material cost

The  input  used  in  producing  any  good  or  service  is  called  material. The  money 
spent on the material is the material cost. 

In the previous example, water, sugar, tea leaves and milk powder can be 
considered material, and the cost incurred for them is the material cost.

Labour and labour cost

The process of converting input into output requires human labour. A payment must 
be made for labour, and this can be identified as labour cost. These payments are 
called salaries and wages.

Other expenses incurred in production

Apart from the above material and labour costs there are other expenses which are 
incurred  through  the  production  activities.  Such  expenses  can  be  taken  as  other 
expenses incurred in production.  In the previous example, if there were an electric 
bulb lit at the time of making tea, it would also amount to a certain cost. Such general 
expenses are considered under this category. In addition, based on the lifetime of a 
fixed asset, a portion of its value should be deducted in the form of an expense. This 
is called depreciation.

In a manufacturing plant, electricity used for lighting, salary for the security guard, 
insurance coverage for the plant, depreciation of fixed assets etc are examples for 
other expenses.

3.5  Unit cost of production

When the total production cost is divided by the number of units produced, we get 
the production cost of one unit.

              Total production cost

     Unit cost of production  =
                                                          Number of units

3.6 Preparing a production plan

To further clarify the concepts discussed above, let us study the production plan

4.1 Introduction to an administrative plan

It is difficult for the owner/s of a business to 
run  all  the  business  activities  by  themselves. 
Therefore they need various human resources 
for the business. The administrative plan is the 
document  that  contains  the  information  and 
cost estimates regarding the human resources 
that  a  business  needs.  It  also  describes  the 
functions,  responsibilities  and  authorities  of 
each person involved in the business.

Figure 4.1

The following information is included in an administrative plan

  Administrative positions and functions
  Employee salaries and wages
  Other administrative expenditure
  Administrative fixed assets

Now let us discuss each of these in detail. 

4.2 Administrative positions and functions

A business organization consists of various divisions to handle its different activities 
related to production, marketing, finance, administration, etc. and there are many 
positions that come under each of these divisions. It is the administrative plan that 
gives  information  on  these  positions  in  the  business  organization:  the  functions 
and responsibilities assigned to each position and the qualifications required. An 
organizational chart can be used to indicate the divisions of a business organization 
based on its functions, as well as the various positions in the organization and their 
hierarchy.

Figure  4.2  given  below  shows  the  divisions  of  a  business  organization  based 
on  its  basic  functions.  It  is  an  example  for  an  organizational  chart  showing  the 
administrative positions of an organization.

4.3  Employee salaries and wages

The administrative plan should present an estimate of all the payments that will be 
made to the people holding various positions in the organization. If the owner/s of 
the business also perform some work and they have to be paid for it, those payments 
should also be included in the plan.

4.4  Other administrative expenses

Apart from salaries and wages, if there are any other expenses related to the administrative 
functions of the business, they should be included in the estimate of expenditure. 

The following are some examples for expenses which are related to the administrative 
functions. 

Rental  for  buildings,  telephone  charges,  stationery  expenses,  maintenance  of 
administrative fixed assets repair and depreciation, office electricity charges, postal 
charges, etc.

4.5  Administrative fixed assets

There are fixed assets which are directly related to the administrative functions of a 
business, such as buildings and installations, office equipment, etc. The depreciation 
of these assets should be calculated based on their value and lifetime, and it should 
be indicated as an administrative expense.

4.6 Preparing an administrative plan

To further clarify the concepts discussed above, let us study the administrative plan 
prepared for the following case. 

After completing her school education, Geetha Weerasooriya joined a vocational 
training  course  where  she  gained  knowledge  and  training  on  manufacturing 
traveling bags. After that, she worked for a short period as a supervisor in a 
factory  manufacturing  traveling  bags.  Having  resigned  from  the  job,  Geetha 
wishes to start her own business of manufacturing traveling bags.

She wants to start the business with 10 sewing machines and plans to rent a 
building in the town. She herself will serve as the General Manager and will 
claim  a  salary  of  Rs.  25  000  per  month.  In  addition  to  her  functions  as  the 
General  Manager,  she  will  handle  the  activities  related  to  purchasing  and 
selling. Further, it is she who will cut the material for sewing the bags with.

5.1  Introduction to a Financial Plan

You have studied the marketing, production and administrative plans that should 
be included in a business plan from the previous chapters. This chapter explains 
the final and the most important part of a business plan, i.e. the financial plan. The 
forecasted financial requirements and the profitability of the expected business is 
included in the financial plan. 

Further, the money expected to invest in the business, cash inflows and outflows 
and the daily cash requirements of the business are estimated by a financial plan. 
Similarly  this  shows  the  expected  profit  calculated  considering  the  forecasted 
income and expenditure of the business for a specific period.  

Financial plan is useful for an entrepreneur due to following reasons.

 To decide the amount of funds required for the business
 To minimize financial problems 

 To identify the business result (profit/loss) of the business at the end of a 

     specific period

 To assess the adequacy of the above said business result

Information included in a financial plan are given below.

 Activities and expenses prior to starting the business

 An estimation of the total investment

 Statement of expected cash inflows and out flows
 Calculation of expected business results  

Let’s briefly discuss each of these parts.

5.2  Activities and expenses prior to business startup

There are activities to be completed and expenses to be incurred before starting any 
activity. Similarly, before starting a business, certain activities should be done and 
expenses should be borne by the entrepreneur. Some such activities and expenses 
are given below.

Expenses on market survey

One of the main things done before starting a new business is studying the market 
relating to the business. We call this a market survey. Expenses on market survey 
includes  expenses  incurred  to  gather  the  required  data,  to  analyze  them  and  to 
prepare reports relating to the expected business.

Examples :-

Expenses required to study the consumer needs, competitors,
distribution methods of products and service, price for which the
product or the service can be sold 

Expenditure on improving the business premises

The business premises should be arranged to suit the business before starting the 
business activities. Expenses that should be incurred with this regard are known as 
expenditure on improving the place.

Examples :- 
   Installation of electricity, water, internet 
   facility, telephone networks and  
               expenses of land preparation, cleaning 
   and preparing the premises.  

Figure 5.1

Expenditure for searching the raw materials and the equipment

Before starting the business, equipments required to the business should be bought 
and  installed.  Similarly,  if  the  business  is  a  production,  entrepreneur  should 
search  for  the  methods  and  institutions  to  get  the  raw  materials  and  equipments 
cost-effectively.  Cost  incurred  to  find  the  information  relating  to  the  suppliers 
(institutions) of the raw materials and equipment, their prices, etc. come under this 
category.

Examples :-  

Expenses incurred to visit the suppliers and inspect the materials 
and equipment, exchange the files and documents, sample 
inspection

Registration Expenses 

When starting a business it should be registered at authorized institutions. Further, 
for some businesses, a special approval or licenses should be obtained.

Examples :- 

A special license should be obtained from the following institutions 
when starting a business relating to granite quarrying 

Central Environmental Authority -Sri Lanka  

Department of Archeology

Geological Survey and Mines Bureau

Expenses incurred to register the business and to obtain licenses come under this 
category.

Other Expenses

All other expenses which are not mentioned above and but are to be incurred when 
starting a business come under this category.

Examples :-

Legal expenses, cost of business plan preparation, expenses for the 
inauguration ceremony

business  in  advance.  A  total  investment  estimate  is  prepared  for  this  purpose. 
Sometimes this is known as “cost of the project”.

Contents of a total investment estimate

The total investment estimate of a business plan consists with the following elements.

 Value of the fixed assets
 Expenses that should be incurred prior to business startup
 Initial funds required to conduct the day to day business activities 

                (working capital) 

Value of the fixed assets 

Fixed assets like land, buildings, machineries, equipments, vehicles and furniture 
are required to conduct business activities. These assets can be utilized for future 
years in the business. Here all long-term assets and their values that are included in 
the production, marketing and administrative plans mentioned earlier are considered 
as fixed assets of the business.

Expenses that should be incurred prior to business startup

We have studied the expenses that should be incurred prior to business startup in the 
section 5.2 above. All those expenses are taken in to consideration when preparing 
the total investment estimate. 

Expenses required to conduct the day to day business activities

Entrepreneur should possess an adequate amount of funds at the beginning of the 
business  in  order  to  conduct  the  business  activities  continuously  and  smoothly. 
The amount of cash required to conduct the day to day business activities are also 
known as working capital.

When deciding the initial working capital requirement of the business, it is necessary 
to calculate the production, marketing and administrative expenses that are required 
from the beginning of the business activities till cash flows in to the business. 

Such  working  capital  is  estimated  based  on  funds  required  for  all  expenses  for 
the  above  said  period  including  materials,  employee  salaries,  water,  telephone, 
advertising, distribution, rental and interest should be calculated.

It is unfavorable for a business to have an excessive working capital or a deficit and 
should maintain on an optimum level. If adequate working capital is not available 
within the business, the smooth and continuous flow of business activities will be 
disrupted.

Examples :-  

If enough cash is not available to buy the raw materials in due time, 
the business will not be able to do its production. As a result, all the
business activities will be stagnated and delayed and business will 
generate losses.

The disadvantage of maintaining a working capital surplus is the loss of 
income that can be earned by investing those money in another 
investment.

Having to pay a higher interest or comply with disadvantageous 
conditions when getting money instantly for a certain requirement 
could arise due to a working capital deficit.

After  deciding  the  value  of  fixed  assets,  pre-startup  costs  and  working  capital 
requirement, it is necessary to decide whether the business is going to cover those 
requirements through the owners’ investments or funds acquired from external parties.

Study  how  a  total  investment  estimate  is  prepared  through  the  following 
exercise.

5.5   Calculating the business results

By conducting a business an entrepreneur expects to earn profits. If the profit of the 
business at the end of a specific period is to be identified at present, such expected 
profit should be forecasted by considering the expected income and expenses.

The forecasted income statement included in the financial plan (a main component 
of a business plan) fulfills the above requirement of the entrepreneur. 

The forecasted income statement includes the following things.

Estimated total income

The total value of the products or services expected to be sold by a business during 
a specific period of time is known as estimated sales income. Both the cash sales 
and the credit sales should be considered here. Similarly, if there are other income, 
a business expects to earn, they should also be included here. Accordingly, the total 
expected income includes the sales income and other income expected to be earned 
during the period.  

Estimated total expenses 

All the expenses expected to incur for the products and services which are to 
expected to be sold during a specific period of time is known as estimated total
expenses. When calculating this expenditure, production cost and non-production 
cost should be stated separately.  

  Production cost

Expenses that directly contribute to the production of the business come 
under this category. When calculating the production cost following 
cost should be considered. 

    Material cost
    Labour cost
    Other costs (overhead cost)

   Non production cost

Expenses that do not directly relate to the production activities of the 
business come under this category. They are;

    Selling and distribution expenses included in the marketing plan
    Administrative expenses included in the administrative plan
    Financial expenses included in the financial plan (e.g. loan interest) 

Expected business result 

Expected business result can be calculated by deducting 
the  estimated  total  expenses  from  the  expected  total 
income. This can be a profit or a loss. The decision to 
start the business can be made, if the result is a profit and 
if the investor is satisfied that the profit is adequate for 
the money invested.

6.1   Introduction to business organizations 

You have already gained a good understanding about the preparation of business 
plans. The next step is selecting a suitable type of business organization in order to 
implement the plan. This chapter aims to give you the required guidance with this 
regard. At present different businesses help people to satisfy their needs and wants. 
Accordingly, businesses are related with all daily activities of people. The influence  
of businesses can be seen not only when we fulfill our daily requirements like foods 
and clothes, but also when satisfying our all other day today needs and wants.

Example :- 

Products like books, pens and pencils that you use

Different organizations that provide the services like banking and 

                        insurance

            Activity 01

Name  some  of  the  day  to  day  wants  of  your  home  and  state  the  business 
organizations that help to satisfy them.

After doing the above activity, you can understand that it is necessary to get the 
assistance of different parties in order to fulfill your needs and wants and you are 
clear  that  business  organizations  are  behind  all  these  activities. To  start  and  run 
businesses, individuals should organize as groups. Thus, units comprise of group 
of people working together for the purpose of achieving a common goal are called 
organizations. Accordingly, different business organizations have been established 
at present in order to satisfy the needs and wants of people.

Entities that engage in production and distribution of goods and services with the 
aim of earning profits, achieving social wellbeing or fulfilling any other objective 
while using limited resources to satisfy human needs and wants are called business 
organizations.

Some of the common characteristics that can be seen in every business organization 
are given below.

  Having an objective
  Using limited resources
  Having an organizational structure
  Engaging in an economic activity
  Having a group of people who work together (owners, employees etc.)

6.2   Classification of business organizations

Today different business organizations have been established to supply goods and 
services for the purpose of satisfying needs and wants of people. 

These different types of business organizations can be classified based on different 
criteria. Here, we consider only the following criteria which are often used. 

  Ownership
  Objective

Classification of business organizations based on ownership

The ownership of the business is explained based on the way the financial resources 
are provided to start the business. Parties that deploy resources in the business are 
called owners. Owners enjoy the profits or losses earned by a business.

Based on ownership, business organizations are classified as follows.

  Private sector businesses
  Public sector businesses

When financial resources are deployed in a business by an individual or group of 
individuals, the ownership of the business is with the private sector. Then they are 
called private sector businesses.

Similarly  when  the  financial  resources  are  provided  by  the  government,  the 
ownership is with the government and they are called public sector organizations. 

Classification of businesses based on the ownership is given below.

Classification of business organizations based on their objectives

Entrepreneurs conduct businesses with the aim of achieving different objectives.  
Businesses can be classified as follows based on their objectives

  Profit oriented businesses
  Not-for profit organizations

If a business is carried out by an entrepreneur with the objective of gaining profit, 
such businesses are called profit oriented business organizations.

Examples :-

Private hospitals
Private banks

Similarly,  the  objective  of  some  businesses  is  not  to  earn  profits  but  to  provide 
benefits to the society. Such organizations are called not-for profit organizations. 

Examples :-

Red Cross Society
Lions club
Sarvodaya
Sports clubs

Profit oriented businesses and not-for profit organizations are operating under both 
the private and the public sectors. Figure 6.2 depicts how the business organizations 
are classified based on the objective.

After  learning  the  above  information,  we  hope  that  you  have  understood  that 
businesses can be classified based on different criteria. An entrepreneur should be 
clever enough to select the most suitable type of business organization among these 
different types of business organization.

We discuss only the following types of business organizations which are classified 
based on ownership. 

   Sole proprietorships
   Partnerships
   Incorporated companies 

6.3  Sole proprietorships

At  present  sole  proprietorships  can  be 
identified  as  one  of  the  most  common 
business  types  that  many  entrepreneurs 
start. These are also known as single owner 
businesses.  Since  entrepreneurs  can  easily 
start  these  businesses  with  a  small  amount 
of capital, they can be seen in almost all the 
countries in the world. 

A  business  started,  owned  and  run  solely  by  the  owner  is  known  as  a  sole 
proprietorship. 

Figure 6.3

Main characteristics of sole proprietorship. 

Some of the main characteristics of sole proprietorships are given below.

  Capital is provided by the owner

An initial capital is required to get the different resources that are required to start 
the business. Investing the capital solely by the owner is a characteristic of sole 
proprietorships.  Capital  can  be  found  through  different  ways  including  owners’ 
savings, funds given by relatives or friends, a loan obtained by selling or mortgaging 
his/ her assets or a loan taken from a financial institution.

67

 
 
 
  Ownership rests with a single person

Since capital required for the business is invested by a single person, the ownership 
too is with that person.

  Profits or losses are borne alone

The profit earned by the business belongs to the owner. Similarly, if the business 
incurs losses, that should be borne by the owner alone. 

  No continued existence

The continuity of the business can stop due to such reasons as death of the owner, 
insanity or any other passivity.

  Unlimited liability of the owner

Liability means the obligations to repay the loans and other advances obtained from 
external  parties.  In  sole  proprietorships,  liability  of  the  owner  is  unlimited.  this 
means that even the private properties of the entrepreneur may have to be sacrificed  
to settle the liabilities of the business.

  Registration is not mandatory

It is not mandatory to register a sole proprietorship. Yet registration of the business 
is very useful. If it is registered, it will be registration of the business name. The 
business name will be registered under the Business Name Registration Ordinance, 
No.06 of 1918 at the divisional secretariat of the respective provincial council.

  No legal personality

This means that a sole proprietorship cannot conduct any legal operations by its 
own business name. If required to do so, it should be done by the name of the owner. 

Examples :- 

Filing legal  cases, obtaining bank loans, purchasing of vehicles 
should be done not by the name of the business but by the name of 
the owner.

  Business can solely be led at owner’s discretion  

Examples :- 

Hiring and firing of employees
Expanding the business operations
Making decisions regarding the price of the products

Starting  Sole Proprietorships  

Though starting a sole proprietorship is easy, there are few steps which should be 
followed practically by an entrepreneur. They are given below.

  Obtaining the following applications from the Divisional Secretariat from 

      the respective division where the business is expected to be started. 

     1.  An application form to register the business name of a sole proprietorship

     2.  An application form to obtain the required report from Grama Niladharee 
            regarding the registration of the business name

  Handing over the certified report of the Grama Niladharee and the duly completed 

      application form along with the registration fee to the Divisional Secretary. 

After  receiving  the  above  documents  along  with  the  due  payments,  Divisional 
Secretary will consider them, and if satisfied will register the business and issue the 
Certificate of Registration of Business Name.

            Activity 03       

Obtain the forms required to start a sole proprietorship.

01. Observe the facts which have been requested in these forms.

02. Discuss with your friends and gather data required to fill these forms.

Advantages of sole proprietorships 

  Can be started with a small amount of capital
  Can get the assistance of the members of the family
  Convenience of starting
  Can make independent decisions

  Impact of rules and regulations is minimal

Limitations of sole proprietorships

  Sources to get the required capital are limited
  No separate legal identity
  Unlimited liability of the owner
  No continuous existence
  Losses should be solely  borne by the  owner
  Individual decisions of the owner may be unsuccessful

            Activity 04      

Saman started a business enterprise using a small amount of money he had 
saved. He was happy as he didn’t have to make much effort and spend much 
time  for  the  initial  activities  in  the  establishment  of  the  business.  He  was 
committed to the business and worked hard.

Though different difficulties arose, he gave quick solutions to them converting 
the  issues  in  to  his  experiences  and  conducted  the  business  activities 
continuously. Once Saman had to appear before the courts as a customer 
filed a case against one of his employees for a mistake done by the employee. 
However, Saman was able to continue with his plans and run the business 
profitably. 

Though  Saman  wanted  to  improve  his  business  further,  he  realized  that 
obtaining the required additional capital is difficult. Even though there was 
the possibility of obtaining bank loans further, he was not interested to do so 
since there was the risk of settling them.

Though Saman got sick due to the heavy work load of the business, he always 
tried his best to carry on the business activities successfully.

6.4   Partnerships

Partnerships  too  have  received  an  important  place  in  the  economy  as  a  type  of 
a  private  sector  business  organization.  The  ability  of  entrepreneurs  to  engage 
in  business  activities  together  than  individually  has  been  a  major  reason  for  the 
establishment of partnerships. Similarly partnerships have emerged owing to the 
requirements of getting more capital, making right management decisions, getting 
the involvement of individuals with different skills, etc. It can be seen that people 
who are engaged in the professional fields such as accounting, law, tax and medicine 
and the parties who do production and trade organize as partnerships.   

Partnership Ordinance of 1980 affects 
the  partnerships  conducted 
in  Sri 
Lanka.  According  to  this  Ordinance, 
partnerships are defined as follows. 

A  relationship  between  two  or  more 
individuals with the objective of earning 
profits is known as a partnership. 

Figure 6.4

Main characteristics of partnerships

Special characteristics of a partnership are given bellow. 

  Number of partners

In order to start a  partnership there should be  minimum of  two partners and the 
maximum number is limited to 20.

  Existence of an agreed (stipulated) relationship among partners 

A partnership is started according to the agreement arrived by the partners. This 
agreement  can  be  written,  oral  or  implied.  The  agreement  among  the  partners 
regarding the partnership is known as the partnership agreement.

  No continued existence 

The continuity of the partnership is obstructed due to the change of the partnership 
agreement or due to the death, insanity or bankruptcy of a partner.

  Unlimited liability of the partners

Partners  are  unlimitedly  liable  for  the  liabilities  of  the  partnership. Accordingly, 
partners  may have to sacrifice their private properties to pay off the debt of the 
partnership  if  the  assets  of  the  partnership  are  not  sufficient  when  settling  its 
liabilities. 

  No separate legal identity

Since  a  partnership  is  not  considered  as  a  legal  person  before  the  law,  it  cannot 
perform  legal  activities  in  its  business  name.  Hence,  the  legal  matters  of  the 
partnership should be done not in its business name but using the personal names 
of the partners. 

  Not mandatory to register a partnership

It is not mandatory to register a partnership. Yet many advantages can be obtained 
by  registering  a  partnership.  Here  the  business  name  of  the  partnership  will  be 
registered.  Registration  can  be  done  under  the  Business  Name  Registration 
Ordinance, No 06 of 1918 at the Divisional Secretariat of the respective provincial 
council. 

  Every partner will be a representative (or an agent) of other partners

Every partner is liable for the affairs done by each partner. Hence, every partner is 
considered as a representative of other partners. 

Starting a partnership

A  partnership  can  be  started  in  the  same 
way  as  a  sole  proprietorship.  Yet,  since 
there  may  be  a  maximum  up  to  20 
partners,  it  might  face  different  practical 
issues when running the business. Though 
a  partnership  agreement  can  be  arrived 
at  in  writing,  orally  or  by  implication 
(implied),  it  is  more  suitable  to  conduct 
the  partnership on a written agreement. 

Figure 6.5

This written agreement is known as the partnership deed. 
It is important to have the stipulated agreement in writing in order to minimize the 
practical issues that may arise in a partnership when doing business.

  The method of capital contribution by the partners

  The way of sharing profits and losses

  The way how the partners contribute to the affairs of the business 

  Paying salaries to the partners

  Arrangement of paying interest to the partners for the loans given to the 

           business other than the capital

  Other common agreements regarding the conduct of the partnership

Advantages of partnerships

  Convenience of commencing 

  Can raise more capital

  Can take collective decisions

Amal Piyarathne and Kamal Jayarathne started a partnership to sell garments and 
agreed to register it under the name of “Rathna Dress”. Further they agreed to put 
Rs 50,000 by each and to equally share the profits and losses of the business. Kamal 
decided not to engage in business activities since he was doing another job and it 
was agreed that Amal should attend to the marketing affairs of the business for a 
monthly salary of Rs. 20,000. Moreover, they decided to pay an annual interest of 
10% for the extra funds invested in the business other than the capital. Similarly 
they decided that in case if a new partner joins the business, it should be done with 
the consent of both partners.

Prepare  a  partnership  deed  for  the  partnership,  “Rathna  Dress”  according  to  the 
above information.

6.5  Incorporated companies

Incorporated companies can be identified as a popular form of business organization 
which mainly represents the private sector category. Companies Act No. 07 of 2007 
of Sri Lanka affects the commencement of an incorporated company. 

Since  even  a  single  person  can  start  an  incorporated  company  according  to  the 
Companies Act of Sri Lanka, most of the entrepreneurs are interested in starting 
this type of businesses. Receiving the status of a legal personality is another reason 
for the popularity of incorporated companies.

An incorporated company can simply be defined as follows.

Incorporated companies are business organizations which are registered under the 
Companies Act  No.  07  of  2007  and  which  have  a  separate  legal  identity  and  a 
continued existence.

  Incorporated under the Companies Act

Every company should be registered under the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007. It is 
done by the Registrar of Companies of  the Department of  Registrar of Companies.

  Raising capital through shareholders

The capital required for an incorporated company is raised by issuing shares.

  Limited liability of the shareholders

In an incorporated company, the liability of the shareholders regarding liabilities is 
limited. This means that the liability of the shareholders is limited to the value of 
the shares they had bought from the company.

  Management of the company is done by directors

The management of a company is done by directors selected and appointed by the 
company shareholders who are the owners of the company too. 

  Having a continued existence

An incorporated company is a separate entity from its owners. Hence the death, 
bankruptcy or full or half passivity of a shareholder does not obstruct the continuation 
of the company. 

  Have a separate legal personality

Companies  are  incorporated  under  the  Companies  Act  No  07  of  2007.  Hence,  an 
incorporated company is considered as a legal person and entering in to contracts, 
acquiring assets, obtaining loans from financial institutions etc., can be done in the 
name of the company.

entrepreneurs prefer private limited companies for their businesses.

Private limited companies

Private  limited  companies  can  be  identified  as  a  business  organization  which  is 
popular among  the Sri  Lankan entrepreneurs at  present. Ability of  even  a  single 
person to start, having a legal personality, ability to get the involvement of family 
members, friends and relatives, etc., for the commencement are the main reasons 
for this popularity. 

Companies Act of No. 07 of 2007 has given a definition to private limited companies 
and it can be stated as follows. 

Companies of which the number of shareholders are limited to 50, shares cannot be

Since, based on the companies Act, even a single person can start a private limited 
company, the minimum number of shareholders of a private limited company will 
be  one.  Similarly,  the  maximum  number  of  shareholders  of  such  companies  has 
been limited to 50 by the Companies Act.

  Managed by a board of directors

Management  of  limited  companies  is  done  by  a  board  of  directors.  According

entrepreneur to join the large scale businesses and carry on the business activities. 
These businesses are operated as sole proprietorships, partnerships or incorporated 
companies.

7.1   Introduction to culture

At the beginning of human civilization it can be seen that man has been working 
with different parties of the society as well as with the various cultures in satisfying 
their  needs  and  wants. The  values  of  a  culture  shape  the  people.  Culture  can  be 
explained as beliefs, values, attitudes, behavior patterns, different ideas, customs 
and norms that exist among people of a society which are unique to them. Depending 
on the characteristics of these cultural elements, the behavior of the people will be 
decided.

   Example :-  
         In Sri Lankan society, people from different races like Sinhalese, 
              Tamils, Muslims and Burgers are living together and these ethnic 
               groups possess values, beliefs, attitudes and different behaviors which 
              are unique to them.

Figure 7.1

7.2   Introduction to entrepreneurial culture

Entrepreneurial culture is a collection of elements like special behaviors, attitudes, 
beliefs,  ideas,  behavior  patterns,  rites,  rituals,  and  customs  which  are  unique  to 
entrepreneurs. 

A person living in the entrepreneurial society inherits entrepreneurial traits. That 
is the person who thinks positively, accepts risks creatively and does innovations. 
Moreover, such people are dissatisfied with the status quo and try to change the 
prevailing condition. Further those people are very sensitive to the environment and 
owing to that sensitivity they have the capability of identifying the opportunities 
and chasing them. As soon as the opportunities are identified, they exploit them.

7.3   Need for the creation of an entrepreneurial culture

Most of the countries in the world have developed due to the influence of cultural 
and social forces. Since efforts are being taken to develop Sri Lanka, the need for an 
entrepreneurial culture is highlighted. Solutions to most of the economic and social 
problems of Sri Lanka can be found through this.

 A Solution to unemployment 

The  unemployment  rate  of  Sri  Lanka  is  considerable.  The  nature  of  this 
unemployment is very complex.

 Example :-
      Unemployment is high among educated people than the uneducated 

                    people.

      Unemployment is at a high percentage among the youth aged below 30 
          years.

      A considerable percentage of the workforce of Sri Lanka migrates for jobs.

      Unemployment is high among educated women.

Hence the creation of jobs for the workforce of Sri Lanka can be done very easily 
within an entrepreneurial culture. 

 Achievement of economic growth

If an economy is to grow, production of goods and services within that economy 
should  increase.  Any  country  can  achieve  high  economic  growth  through  an 
entrepreneurial culture. 

 Availability of unused resources

Sri  Lanka  is  a  land  full  of  resources.  Those  resources  are  not  properly  utilized 
at  present.  There  is  a  possibility  of  generating  products  by  using  those  unused 
resources.

85

 
 
 
 
 
 
  Need for new job creators

It has become difficult to provide jobs for the people compared to the population 
growth of Sri Lanka. In order to provide jobs, new businesses should be created. As 
a result, direct and indirect jobs will be created when conducting and developing 
those businesses.

 Need to minimize the inconsistencies in income distribution

Inconsistency in income distribution occurs when a large part of the population of 
the country receives a small portion of the national income and small part of the 
population receives a large portion of the national income.   

Through  popularization  of  the  entrepreneurial  culture,  entrepreneurial  ability  of 
many people will be improved. Through that ability, they can earn profits. Further 
through the increase in employment, income will flow to the low income earning 
segment. This will minimize the inconsistencies in income distribution.

7.4  Social and economic factors conducive for the emergence  
       of an entrepreneurial culture

There are many social and economic factors favourable for the emergence of an 
entrepreneurial culture. Some of them are given below.

 Existence of a favorable economic environment

To start and run new businesses, there should be a favourable economic environment 
for entrepreneurs. Economic factors should be in favour of business activities. This 
include factors such as low interest rates, increase in income level and favourable 
foreign exchange rates.

 Stable political condition

Having  a  political  authority  which  makes  favourable  rules  and  regulations  and 
policies for the identification of solutions to economic and social problems giving 
prominence  to  entrepreneurship  while  securing  it  will  be  very  helpful  for  the 
emergence of an entrepreneurial culture. Further the political authority should have 
understood the rewards of entrepreneurship.

 Incentives given by government and other organizations

Government and public sector organizations can immensely support the upliftment 
of entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurial culture can be developed by giving financial 
and non-financial aids.

   Examples :-
        Giving tax relief
        Giving loans under concessionary conditions
        Giving training and advice
        Giving aids
        Facilitating the meetings of local and foreign buyers
        Organizing workshops and exhibitions

 Having a family background which encourages entrepreneurship

A  family  background  which  encourages  entrepreneurship  will  positively  affect 
the creation of an entrepreneurial culture. Creation of an environment within the 
family which encourages the development of entrepreneurial capabilities will help 
the generation of successful entrepreneurs in the future. There is a greater tendency 
for new generations to choose entrepreneurial activities when their families have 
family businesses which have existed continuously. This too is a favorable factor 
which help the emergence of an entrepreneurial culture. 

 Encouragement given by large businesses

Large businesses often get the help of small and medium scale businesses when 
conducting their businesses. Hence large businesses always provide different aids 
to small and medium scale businesses.

     Examples :-  

   Obtaining raw materials and parts required by large companies from 
      small businesses. Transferring some production activities to small 
     businesses (sub contracting)

 Ability of obtaining resources

Availability of ample resources and ability to use them for production are factors 
which encourage entrepreneurship.

 Role models

Ability to witness role models of successful entrepreneurs in the society is a major 
factor which influences the creation of an entrepreneurial culture. Such a guidance 
will help the entrepreneurs to understand the way they should proceed.

 Encouragement given by different parties

Encouragement given by the members of the family, school, different societies and 
friends, makes a favourable impact for the creation of an entrepreneurial culture. At 
present, newspapers and electronic media can play a big role in this regard.

7.5   Social factors which obstruct entrepreneurship

There are many personal rewards of being an entrepreneur. Further, entrepreneurs 
generate  higher  rewards  for  the  economy  as  well.  One  of  the  mechanisms  of 
the  development  of  a  country  is  entrepreneurship.   Yet  many  are  reluctant  to  be 
entrepreneurs.

Let’s discuss some social factors that go against entrepreneurship.

  High recognition given to salaried jobs

The dream of most of Sri Lankans is to do a highly paid job. The reason for this 
is the tendency of the society to judge the success and the recognition of a person 
from his or her job. Owing to this attitude, many are used to wait expecting a job 
by suppressing their entrepreneurial skills. 

  Reluctance to accept risks and challenges

A main characteristic of an entrepreneur is the readiness to accept manageable 
risks. They should accept the challenge of making their innovations successful. 
Therefore, the unwillingness of people to accept risk and challenges is another 
barrier to the entrepreneurship.

  Lack of encouragement from education

The present traditional education system does not support the generation of people 
who can see the world with a creative mind, change the status quo and accept risks 
and challenges. This acts as a barrier for entrepreneurship.

  Insufficient government support

Weaknesses of policies which are for the development of entrepreneurship in Sri 
Lanka and insufficiency of incentives given to promote entrepreneurs are barriers 
for entrepreneurship.

For free distribution.

89

  Dependent mentality

Most of the Sri Lankans today have high expectations towards what they inherit 
from their parents and try to live by spending what they have inherited thereafter. 
Further, they expect subsidies given by the government. People are reluctant to earn 
what they need through their own effort. Such mentality acts as a negative factor 
which demotivates people from being entrepreneurs.

7.6   Role of women in entrepreneurship

        ‘The hand that rocks the cradle, rules the world’

to 

The  above  saying  depicts  the  unique  capability 
within a woman. They can lead anything towards 
success  due 
their  creativity,  dedication, 
risk  taking  ability,  intelligence,  gumption  and 
flexibility. Owing to above qualities, women today 
choose to be successful entrepreneurs individually 
or as groups by identifying new opportunities and 
converting  them  to  their  own  business.  Further 
they  provide  job  opportunities  to  others  through 
their businesses. 

Need of women choosing to do businesses

It has become necessary for women to enter into the entrepreneurship field today. 
There are many reasons for this.

Figure 7.3

  To achieve a satisfactory income level

Since  cost  of  living  has  increased  at  present,  it  has  become  difficult  to  run  the 
affairs of a home only with the income of one individual. In order to avoid this, it is 
necessary for women to earn an income through a business.

  Majority of the population being women

When  analyzing  the  composition  of  population  of  Sri  Lanka,  it  is  evident  that 
women represents the majority. Hence, we can come to the conclusion that there 
is a considerable women representation within the workforce of Sri Lanka. Hence, 
women should venture in to business and should give their contribution to uplift the 
economy of the country.

  High unemployment among women

Unemployment rate is high among women. It is a waste of resources of a country. 
When  women  enter  in  to  business,  their  contribution  can  be  used  to  increase 
the  national  production.  It  will  be  a  solution  to  unemployment  since  they  create 
employment for themselves and for the others. 

  Existence of  businesses which need contribution of women

Women’s contribution is needed for the businesses which require unique skills of 
women and qualities like softness and kindness.

   Examples :- 
              Pre-schools, Nursing, Beauty culture, Day care centers, Fashion 
                    designing  

  Trend of women getting higher education  

There  is  an  increasing  trend  among  women  to  get  school  education  as  well  as 
higher education. They can contribute for the economic development of the country 
by starting businesses independently by making use of the higher education they 
acquired.

Opportunities for women to do business

It is important to have opportunities within the business environment for women 
to enter into business. Following are some such opportunities which can be seen in 
the economy of Sri Lanka.

 High demand created for services

A  high  demand  for  different  services  has  been  created  in  order  to  fulfill  human 
needs and wants owing to the facts like busy schedules of people, and increase in 
income levels. Opportunities are open for women to provide those services.

   Examples :- 
            Selling processed foods 
            Laundry service
            Day care service

Figure  7.4

 Existence of business opportunities which can be started with a low investment 

     and low risk

   Examples :-  
            Event management – organizing different functions
            Organizing local and overseas tours

 Unique financial and non -financial incentives being introduced to women

   Examples :-  
            Giving loans at lower interest or interest free
                   Conducting entrepreneurial training programmers for women

 Changing social attitudes regarding women

   Examples :-  
        Recognition given to women 
                      in the society has been increased

               Acknowledging the economic 
            contribution  made by women

                 Women engaging in activities

businesses. Sometimes women refrain from being 
an entrepreneur due to those barriers. Some such 
barriers are given below.

 Challenge of balancing the roles of the 
      personal life and the role as an entrepreneur

 Women have to give prominence to    
               household activities and as a result 
     attention given to the business can go 
     down.

         Activity 02

Naveesha was a student in grade 08 and is the eldest daughter of a family which had 
economic difficulties. Her brother is studying in grade 04. Her father is a labourer 
and mother is a house wife. The salary of Naveesha’s father is not enough for all the 
household activities. Yet her mother was frugal and responsible enough to spend 
a greater portion of the income on the education of children and the rest for other 
needs of the home. Though income difficulties were there, they lived a happy life. 

One  day  Naveesha’s  father  met  with  an  accident  and  became  bed-ridden.  As 
a  result,  he  lost  his  job.  Naveesha  regretted  a  lot  seeing  the  helplessness  of  her 
mother who didn’t receive any income for the medical treatments of her father and 
for the household affairs. Naveesha’s mother was a very courageous woman and 
she determined to stand on her own. Naveesha’s mother started a small institution 
which makes handbags utilizing the resources available in her area with the small 
amount of money she has saved. Naveesha was amazed when she saw the dedication 
of her mother who worked hard for her business day and night while doing all the 
work of her father without any negligence.

Her  creations  were  different  when  compared  to  the  other  handbags  available  in 
the market. As a result she was able to increase the sales of her products. She was 
able to give jobs in her business for four women of her area within a short period 
of time and became a famous and a successful individual of the area. Further, she 
was selected as a member of the executive committee of the women’s society of the 
area. The fact that she was able to continue the education of her children and earn 
a satisfactory income to nurture them witnessed that she had successfully faced the 
challenge of balancing the roles of her personal life and the role as an entrepreneur. 

After recovering fully, Naveesha’s father was satisfied with the achievements her 
mother had gained when he was disabled and decided not to seek other jobs and to 
join and develop the business of Naveesha’s mother. Naveesha too determined to be 
a successful woman entrepreneur like her mother after studying well.

Read the above case carefully and answer the following questions.

01. Identify the entrepreneurial characteristics of Naveesha’s mother.

7.7  Business ethics and social responsibility

Business Ethics

A  business  should  earn  profits  without  harming  the  environment  and  any  other 
party. For that it is necessary to follow a code of ethics when running businesses. 
Those business ethics depend upon the values of the people who are involved in 
the business. 

Common agreements arrived at in writing, verbally or symbolically, by a person or 
a group of people regarding what is right and what is wrong or what is good and 
what is bad are called business ethics. 

   Examples :-  
        Giving priority to the consumer in every business affair
        Doing business without harming the natural environment

Suggest few business ethics that should be followed by a business.

          Activity 06

List ten activities that can happen in a business which violate business ethics.

Social Responsibility of a Business 

The  traditional  view  regarding  the  social  responsibility  of  a  business  is  that  a 
business should provide maximum returns for the capital invested by the owners. 
But at present, the social responsibility of a business has become a broader concept.

Social  responsibility  of  a  business  indicates  that  a  business  has  a  responsibility 
towards  the  owners  of  the  business  as  well  as  the  whole  external  society  within 
which the business is operated and nurtured.

Hence  businesses  should  pay  attention  to  the  prevailing  issues  of  the  society 
including protecting the environment, economic development, social and cultural 
development and establishment of a peaceful society. 

Levels of Social Responsibility of a Business 

Social responsibility of a business can be fulfilled according to the following ways.

01.  Economic responsibility
02.  Legal responsibility
03.  Ethical responsibility
04.  Philanthropic responsibility 

96

For free distribution.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
01. Economic responsibility

The responsibility to contribute to increase the rewards of the owners of the business. 
Fulfillment of this is essential for the survival of the business.

   Examples :-  
         Securing the financial stability of the business, profitability, using 
             limited resources efficiently.

02. Legal responsibility 

This is to conducting the business according to the rules and regulations imposed 
by the government and other institutions. 

   Examples :- 
        Paying Employees Provident Fund properly
        Refraining from environmental pollution
        Refraining from using prohibited raw materials

03. Ethical responsibility

This is to comply with the written or symbolic rules which are believed to be right 
by the society in which the business operates. 

Even  though  these  responsibilities  are  not  compulsory  in  order  to  conduct  the 
business,  they  are  fulfilled  by  businesses  as  they  represent  the  expectations  of 
different social parties. 

   Examples :-
        Giving equal job opportunities to women and to the minority

        Training and development of employees 

        Improving the quality of the product/service

04. Philanthropic responsibility 

These are the responsibilities which are not essential for the survival of the business 
and not directly expected by different parties of the society from the business. These 
are  the  high  level  responsibilities  which  are  fulfilled  voluntarily  by  a  business 
without expecting anything in return.

Stakeholders of a Business

Stakeholders  are  the  parties  who  are  influenced  directly  or  indirectly  due  to  the 
conduct of a business.

These parties have different expectations. Some examples for such expectations are 
given below.

        Party 

           Expectation

   Owners         Satisfactory return to the capital invested

   Employees 

  Earning a reasonable salary and the job security.

   Creditors       Recovering the loans provided within the due period    

          Government   Complying with the rules and regulations and charging    
                                        taxes properly    

          Consumers     Obtaining quality products at a reasonable price.

As given in the above illustration different parties believe that their expectations will 
be met and when they are not being met they tend to act against the business. Hence, 
a business should decide their policies and ethics, in a way that the expectations of 
the above groups are met.

Rewards of Complying with Social Responsibility

 Improve the goodwill of the business
 Ensure the long term survival of the business
 Possibility of legal issues to emerge will be low 
 High profitability is ensured as the demand for the products and services 

    of the business increases 

 Satisfaction and loyalty of employees will increase

Cost 

 $ 

01 Though  a  high  cost  has  to  be  born  for  waste  disposal  by  a 
business, complying with that will help create a good image for 
the business. 

02 Businesses  that  are  established  in  an  economy  also  have  the 

responsibility of increasing the welfare of that economy.

03 Stakeholders  are  satisfied  when  a  business  complies  with  the 

equitable ethics which are acknowledged by a society.

04 Responsibilities with which a business should comply affect the 

survival of the business.

05 Responsibilities that the whole society believes a business will 
essentially fulfill are called philanthropic responsibilities.

Being innovative, changing with right knowledge
Be a light to the country as well as to the world.

Message from the Hon. Minister of Education

  The  past  two  decades  have  been  significant  in  the  world  history  due  to  
changes  that  took  place  in  technology.  The  present  students  face  a  lot  of  new  
challenges  along  with  the  rapid  development  of  Information  Technology,  
communication  and  other  related  fields.  The  manner  of  career  opportunities  are 
liable to change specifically in the near future. In such an environment, with a new 
technological and intellectual society, thousands of innovative career opportunities 
would be created. To win those challenges, it is the responsibility of  the Sri Lankan 
Government and myself, as the Minister of Education, to empower you all. 

  This book is a product of free education. Your aim must be to use this book 
properly and acquire the necessary knowledge out of it. The government in turn is 
able to provide free textbooks to you, as a result of the commitment and labour of 
your parents and elders.

Since we have understood that the education is crucial in deciding the future 
of  a  country,  the  government  has  taken  steps  to  change  curriculum  to  suit  the  
rapid changes of the technological world. Hence, you have to dedicate yourselves 
to become productive citizens. I believe that the knowledge this book provides will 
suffice your aim. 

It is your duty to give a proper value to the money spent by the government on 
your education. Also you should understand that education determines your future. 
Make sure that you reach the optimum social stratum through education.

I  congratulate  you  to  enjoy  the  benefits  of  free  education  and  bloom  as  an 

honoured citizen who takes the name of Sri Lanka to the world.  

Akila Viraj Kariyawasam
Minister of Education

Foreword

The  educational  objectives  of  the  contemporary  world  are  becoming  more 
complex along with the economic, social, cultural and technological development. 
The learning and teaching process too is changing in relation to human experiences, 
technological  differences,  research  and  new  indices.  Therefore,  it  is  required  to  
produce  the  textbook  by  including  subject  related  information  according  to  the 
objectives in the syllabus in order to maintain the teaching process by organizing 
learning  experiences  that  suit  to  the  learner  needs.  The  textbook  is  not  merely  a 
learning  tool  for  the  learner.  It  is  a  blessing  that  contributes  to  obtain  a  higher  
education along with a development of conduct and attitudes, to develop values and 
to obtain learning experiences.

The government in its realization of the concept of free education has offered  
you  all  the  textbooks  from  grades  1-11.  I  would  like  to  remind  you  that  you  
should make the maximum use of these textbooks and protect them well. I sincerely 
hope  that  this  textbook  would  assist  you  to  obtain  the  expertise  to  become  a  
virtuous citizen with a complete personality who would be a valuable asset to the 
country.

I would like to bestow my sincere thanks on the members of the editorial and 
writer  boards  as  well  as  on  the  staff  of  the  Educational  Publications  Department 
who have strived to offer this textbook to you.

Natural Resources of the Earth

Things that are found in the natural environment which are required for the 
existence of man and his activities are called natural resources. 

Rocks,  minerals,  soil,  water,  air,  sunlight,  vegetation  and  wildlife  has 
a  special  place  among  the  other  natural  resources.  Man  adds  value  to  resources.  
Value of resources would be decided according to the needs of man and technology. 
The value of resources change from time to time.

The aim of this chapter is to study about natural resources on the Earth such as 
rocks, minerals, soil, water, air, sunlight, vegetation and wildlife.

Resources	 of	 the	 environment	 are	 diverse	 and	 they	 can	 be	 classified	 in	

many ways. (Fig. 1.1)

Rocks 

Rocks have an important place among the other natural resources. The crust 
of the earth is composed of rocks. Rocks are formed by minerals. We can see some 
special features in the rocks formed by minerals. Some rocks are soft while some of 
them are hard. The rock layers are thin in some places while it is deeply spread in 
others.  Hence, the values of the rocks differ according to the composition, distribution 
and	their	structure.		Rocks	can	be	classified	into	three	types	based	on	their	origin.

1. Igneous rocks

2. Sedimentary rocks

3. Metamorphic rocks

Igneous Rocks

Igneous  rocks  are  formed  by  magma  coming  from  the  interior  of  the 
Earth and solidifying on the crust.  They are also called ''Basic rocks.''  They are 
crystalline rocks formed by immense heat and pressure.  There is a glassy and soft 
granular structure in them. Granite, basalt, gabbro are some examples for igneous 
rocks.

 Intrusive igneous rocks are formed by cooling 

and solidifying magma in the interior of the 

Earth. Extrusive igneous rocks are formed 

by cooling of  hot magma when reaching the 

surface of the Earth.

Uses of igneous rocks 

Fig. 1.2 -  I gneous rocks (Granite)          

 ² Granite is used to construct buildings.

 ² Making ornaments.

 ² To obtain minerals such as tin and chromium.

 ²

Igneous rocks, which are resistant to erosion, in slopes prevent soil erosion.

 ² To construct highways and roads.

There is an aesthetic value in the different physical formations of these rocks.

Sedimentary Rocks

Sedimentary rocks are formed by deposition and 
cementation of weathered particles of igneous and 
metamorphic rocks.  

They  are  also  called  secondary  rocks  as 
they  are  formed  by  the  sediments  of  principle 
rocks.  Limestone, Coal and Gypsum can be cited as 
examples for types of sedimentary rocks. 

Uses of sedimentary rocks 

Fig. 1.3 - Sedimentary Rocks 
(Gypsum)

 Alluvial sedimentary rocks are used for agricultural purposes.  

 ² Limestone and sandstone are used in constructing buildings.
 ²
 ² Used as a raw material in pottery industry.
 ² For production of ornamental goods.
 ² Coal is a source of energy.

Metamorphic Rocks

Metamorphic  rocks  are  formed  when 
Igneous  and  Sedimentary  rocks  are  subjected  to 
high pressure and high temperature. 

Gneiss, marble, diamonds and dolomite are 
examples  for  metamorphic  rocks.    Metamorphic 
rocks  can  be  seen  more  commonly  than  the  other 
types of rocks.

Uses of metamorphic rocks 

 ² Diamonds are used to make jewellery.
 ² Marbles  are  used  to  create  statues  and 

ornaments.

 ² Graphite  is  used  to  make  lubricants,  casting 

moulds and paint.

 ² Dolomite is used for manufacturing fertilizer.

(Graphite)

       Areas where gneiss rocks were found were selected to construct ancient 
places of worship as those  rocks were hard.

Minerals

Minerals also have an important place among natural resources. 

 "A mineral is a naturally occurring substance that is solid and inorganic 
representable by a chemical formula and has an ordered atomic structure"

Earth is formed with rocks and rocks are formed with minerals. There 
is a strong relationship between minerals and rocks. Igneous, sedimentary and 
metamorphic  rocks  are  made  up  of  valuable  minerals.  The  value  of  mineral 
resources depend on their uses.

There are about 2000 kinds of minerals in the world but people use only 
a few of them.  Different kinds of minerals have been used for making weapons 
and tools during different periods of human civilization. 

Mineral resources can be categorized as follows.  

 Fuel Minerals 

 Coal, Crude oil

Metallic minerals 

Iron ore, Manganese, Copper

Non Metallic minerals 

Graphite, Sand, Limestone and Phosphate 

We  discuss  the  most  important  resources  such  as  iron  ore,  graphite  and 

crude oil in this lesson.

Iron Ore  - An important factor for the development of human civilization is 
the use of iron.  Iron is extracted from iron ore.  Iron ore is cleansed and smelted 
to  extract  iron.  Through  a  chemical  process,  iron  is  turned  into  steel.    Iron 
and steel have become very essential materials for industries like agriculture, 
construction and transportation because of their special qualities.

Main kinds of iron ore are Hematite, Magnetite and Limonite. An iron 
ore deposit would be economically valuable only if it contributes at least 30% 
of high quality iron.  Map 1.1 shows the regions in the world with iron ore 
deposits.

India  is  the  number  one  graphite  producer  in  the  world,  producing  60% 
of world’s graphite production. Sri Lanka also has gained an important place as a 
country that produces high quality graphite.

Graphite  is  an  industrial  raw  material  used  in  the  electronic  industry, 
construction  of  metal  coverings,  production  of  lubricants,  pencils  and  paints.  
Graphite is also important as a heat and electric conductor.   

       Activities

2. Explain the importance of graphite as a resource by giving examples. 

3. Mark and name in a blank map of the world, the places where graphite is 
    produced and, locations of the main iron ore deposits in the world.  

Soil

Soil is formed by decomposition of organic materials for a long time 

and by mixing up remains of weathering rocks.

Soil is an essential resource for man.  Survival of plants and animals depend 
on soil.  It provides nutrition and water for the growth of plants.  The soil layer 
is found as a thin layer on the surface of the earth. The thickness of the soil layer 
differs from one place to another.

Factors that contribute to

 the formation of soil

 ² Parent rock

 ² Topographical features 

 ² Climate

 ² Time

 ² Parts of plants and animals

 ² Human Activities 

  Parent  rock       -  Minerals  are  added  to  the 
soil by weathering of parent rock or deposition 
of  sediments.  The  soil  content,  (composition) 
categories  and  the  colour  of  the  soil  differ 
according to the nature of the parent rock.

Topographical 

features 

-  According 

to 

topographical features, erosion of soil on earth's  

surface,	deposition	and	infiltration	of	water	into	
soil  affect  the  formation  of  soil.    Nature  of  soil 

and the drainage pattern are affected by the slope 

of an area. 

Climate   - Rainfall and temperature are climatic factors that affect the formation 
of soil. Interior temperature of the soil, the time period in which the moisture 
of soil present within a year, quantity of water that is retained in the soil are 
factors which affect the nature and formation of soil.

Plant and animal parts  - Soil organisms and the cover of trees are sources that 
add organic particles into the soil.  The cover of trees is the most important one.  
In areas where organic systems are abundant, a fertile humus soil layer would be 
formed within a short period of time. 

Time -  Time is an important factor in deciding the nature and the maturity of 
the soil. Fertility of soil increases when organic particles are deposited during 
a long period of time.  Such soil which has a large quantity of mineral salts is 
suitable for the growth of plants.

Human Activities    - Human activities are also a cause for variation of the nature 
of soil and growth of soil. Human activities can completely change the quality of 
soil and soil could also become infertile. 

Soil has been used for agricultural purposes even from the time that man 

established permanent settlements.

Use  of  soil  for  human  activities  has  increased  along  with  the  increasing 
needs of man. Instead of a variety of crops, cultivation of the same crop for a long 
time has caused decline in bio diversity and it eventually results infertile soil. 

Since  soil  is  essential  for  agriculture,  more  attention  is  paid  for  the 

conservation of soil.

Soil Profile

A	soil	profile	is	the	set	of	layers	of	soil	that	is	formed	over	a	long	period	

of	time.	Such	a	profile	in	seen	in	figure	1.5.

Horizon A 
-  It  consists  of  decayed  particles 
and partially decayed parts of animals and plants.  
The  parent  rock  had  completely  weathered  and  a 
large quantity of organic particles are present. It is 
darker than the other horizons below.  This soil is 
called Humus.  

Horizon B 
-  Mineral  salts  and  clay  particles 
leach  to  the  Horizon  A  and  some  types  of  clay 
are  deposited  in  this  layer  of  soil.  Horizon  B  is 
relatively lighter in shade than Horizon A.

Quantity of organic matter is low in thais horizon.

-  This  Horizon  consists  of  parent 
Horizon C 
rock  particles  and  remains  or  particles  which  are 
brought from other substances.

Water Resources

Water is an essential resource for the survival of man and other natural 
ecological  systems.    Man  cannot  live  without  water  except  for  a  few  days.  
Water is a resource which contributes to human activities directly or indirectly. 
The  Earth  is  called  the  ‘Blue  Planet’ 
because  it  is  the  only  planet  which 
has  water.  The  Earth  consists  of 
71.8% of water while the land area is 
28.2%.    This  water  is  stored    in  the 
Oceans, seas, rivers, reservoirs, tanks 
and ponds.  97% of water is sea water 
while  03%  is  fresh  water.    Man  can 
easily use only 01% of the water which 
is a small quantity. Fig. 1.3 show how 
water  resources  are  distributed  Fig. 
1.4  shows  places  where  water  gets 
stored due to the water cycle as well.

Importance of water as a resource

Water  is  essential  to  man  for  of  day  to  day  activities,  agriculture, 
industries and transportation. Man needs about three litters of water per day. If 
it could not be provided, he would be dehydrated.

Water  pollution  occurs  since  waste  water  is  added  to  rivers  and  streams.  
This contaminated water is not in a condition to be consumed by man, animals and 
the bio system. Thus water had become a scarce resource.  It is assumed that this 
condition	may	lead	to	conflicts	among	people	and	nations	to	obtain	water	in	the	
future.

        Activities 

1.  Name three source from which man can obtain water.

2.  Explain in brief, the terms, groundwater, surface water and soil water. 

3. ‘Water is essential for the survival of living beings’’ state 3 facts to prove  
      this statement. 

4 . Suggest three activities that can be done to conserve the water resource. 

Forests

Forest is a very important eco – system.

A Forest is a land eco- system consisting of trees, climbers and plants useful to 
man and animals. 

Forest have been used for many purposes since past. They are naturally 

grown or cultivated.

Forests vary from country to country, and from area to area according to 
the nature of climate and soil.  There are different kinds of forests in the world, 
but we consider only there main types of forests.

22 Natural   Resources  of   Sri   Lanka

Sri Lanka is rich with natural resources. Ocean, land, rock, soil, minerals,  

water  and   forests  are  important   resources  among  them. 

The aim of this chapter is to study about utilization and conservation of natural 
resources of Sri Lanka.

Ocean

The  exact  land  area  of  Sri  Lanka      includes  not  only  the  land  but  a  part  
of  the  ocean  too.  An  International  Law  was  implemented  on  the  16th  of  
November  1994  which  helps  to  decide  the  ownership  of  maritime  boundary 
in  a  country.  According  to  that  each  coastal  state  owns  a  maritime  boundary  
less  than  twelve  nautical  miles  from  the  coast.  It  is  called  ‘The  territorial                 
maritime boundary’.

The air, sea and all internal resources of that boundary belong to Sri Lanka. 
This area which has  islands , lagoons, head lands, bays, coral reefs, sand  and  rocks  
is very useful for the fishing  industry  and  the tourism   industry. 

The zone between   12 -24   Nautical miles is called the 'Contiguous   Zone’. 
The  government  has   the  right  to punish  and  take actions  against  the violation  
of  laws  in  customs , fishing , migrations  and  sanitary  laws within this zone. 

The  Zone  between  24  –  200  Nautical  miles  is  called  the  ‘Exclusive 
Economic  Zone’.  Living  and  non  living  natural  resources,  the  sea  bed  and  
water particles of that area belong to Sri Lanka.

     Other than the above maritime boundaries, Mannar strait, Palk strait, Bay of 
Bengal  which  belong  to  Historic  waters  (Internal  waters)  are  divided  between 
Sri  Lanka  and  India  by  an  agreement.  All  activities  in  this  zone  are  taken  
place with  the  agreement  of  both parties.

crop lands, forests, shrub land and internal reservoirs are such examples.

Study  figure  2.2  and  identify  how  the  land  of    Sri  Lanka  is  utilized  

in different ways.

Fig. 2.2- Different ways the land is used

There  are  several  main  zones  in  Sri  Lanka  with  a  significant  variation 
of the physical features of the land and the specific features pertaining to these 
areas could also be identified. Massive paddy fields and the irrigation systems in 
the dry zone, tea estates and the terraced paddy  cultivation  in the central  hills,  
massive  buildings with many storeys and the road systems in the  urban  lands ,  
fishing  industry   in the coastal   areas   are  examples  for  those specific  features.

 02. Explain the significance of land as a resource. 

Rocks 

  Land  of  Sri  Lanka  consists  of  Igneous,  Sedimentary  and  Metamorphic  
rocks.  These  rocks  are  used  for  many  purposes  since  past.  When  granite 
metamorphoses,  it  turns  into  gneiss. They  are  used  in  construction  of    buildings  
and roads. Hard gneiss was used for construction of stair ways, guard stones and 
pillars  in  religious  buildings  of  Anuradhapura,  Mihintale  etc.  Hard  gneiss  was  
also used in sculpting Samadhi and Aukana Buddha statue.

Miocene limestone  is a sedimentary rock spread along the Jaffna Peninsula 
and  the  Northwestern  coast.  It  is  used  for  production  of  cement,  to  smelt  iron  
ore  and  to  construct  buildings.  Corals  of  the  South  Western  coast  are  used  for

producing  lime. Dolomite, a metamorphic  rock in  Matale,  Kandy,  Balangoda,  
Nalanda,  Digana  and  Habarana  is  used  as  a  fertilizer.  It  is  also  used  in  glass  
and  ceramic  industries  and  it  is  also  used  to  produce  lime  needed  to  construct 
buildings.

Problems in utilization of rocks.

 ² Environmental pollution due to excavation and transportation of rocks.  
 ² Coastal erosion and the flooding caused by sea.
 ² Occurrence of landslides and cracks on buildings caused by vibrations during 

excavations.  

 ² Barren lands which are unsuitable for cultivation. 

Soil of Sri Lanka 

Soil  is  formed  by  weathering  of    parent    rocks  and  decomposition  of  
animal    and    plant    matter.    Factors    such    as  climate,    parent    rock,  vegetation 
cover  and slope land areas are important in the formation  of soil. The quantity of   
rainfall  and the period of receiving rainfall are  the  most  important  factors  that 
help in the  development  process  of  soil in Sri Lanka. Constant rainfall and high 
temperature expedite the weathering process of rocks. Although  Sri  Lanka is a 
small  island,  a    number  of  soil  types  are  found  due  to  the  influence  of  various   
factors. In this chapter we discuss seven main soil Groups in Sri Lanka.

 ² Red brown  soil 

 ² Non calcareous  brown soil

 ² Reddish   brown  latosol  soil

 ² Red yellow  podzolic  soil 

 ² Red yellow latosol  soil

 ² Alluvial  soil

 ² Solidex and Solonetz soil.

How  to  use  the  soil:

 ² Red brown  soil  -  It is found 
only  in  the    Dry  Zone    and  
is  suitable    for    cultivation  
of    dry  crops    and    Chena 
cultivation

 ² Non  calcareous   brown soil - 
It is   found    in  the  interior  
areas  of Ampara , Batticaloa 
and  in    the    coastal    areas. 
is  more  suitable  for 
This 
the  cultivation  of  grains, 
vegetables and grasses.

 ² Reddish 

laterite 
brown 
soil  -  It  is  commonly  found 
in the Wet Zone. This is more 
suitable  for  the  cultivation 
of  tea,  rubber,  coffee,  cocoa, 
cardamoms, cloves and fruits.

Map 2.1 - Distribution of soils in Sri Lanka

 ² Red yellow podzolic soil - This soil is found in the districts that belong 
to  the  low  country  wet  zone. Tea,  rubber,  coconut  are  some  permanent 
crops which can be grown in this area. This is also suitable for  growing  
vegetables and fruits. 

 ² Red  yellow  latosol  soil - This can be seen in the land area from  Putalam  
to  Mullaitivu  along  the North Western coast of  the  Dry  Zone, and in 
the  Jaffna  peninsula.    This  could  be  made  suitable  for  fruit  cultivation 
successfully with the use of fertilizers and proper water supply. 

 ² Alluvial soil - It is spread in river valleys and areas around them in the 

wet and dry zones. It is commonly used for paddy cultivation.

 ² Solidex   and  Solonetz  Soil - This kind of soil is abundantly found in 
areas such as Damana and Tamankaduwa. Suitable for paddy and   grasses.

03. Cite with examples   and explain the importance of mineral   sands   as an  
      industrial raw   material in Sri Lanka.

Problems in utilization   of Mineral   resources 

 ² Environment  pollution  due  to  technical  methods  used  in  mining  mineral 

resources.  

 ² Sand  mining in  river  valleys  would  cause erosion of river banks, floods, 
destruction   of  cultivation  due to  flow of  salinized  water  to  the interior  
of the  country.

 ² Pits are created due to mining and earth slips and landslides may occur too.
 ² Unused pits filled with water for a long time  become breeding grounds for 

mosquitos and bacteria.

 ² Floods occur due to deposition of sediments in rivers and lakes.
 ² Mining can be harmful to  trees and plants in the environment, destruction of  

cultivated lands, water, land and air pollution.

 ² Destruction of aquatic organisms and soil organisms. 

Conservation of Mineral resources

Mineral   resources should be conserved   because   they  are exhaustible 

resources. Steps taken to conserve mineral   resources are as follows: 

 ²
Issuing of licenses  to regularize mineral mining.
 ² Taking the maximum use of the resources available.
 ² Regularizing laws for mining, using and transportation of minerals.
 ² Minimizing wastage when mining. 
 ² Exploring to discover potential mineral resources. 
 ²

Improving efficiency   in technology.

Water

         Sri Lanka is a country with abundant water resources.  Sources of water in 
Sri Lanka are mainly fed by rainfall.  Sri Lanka   receives rainfall from monsoons, 
convectional   rain   and cyclones. The map in figure 2.4 shows the distribution of 
average annual rainfall in Sri Lanka. It clearly shows that the amount of rainfall 
varies in different places.

Map 2.4  - Distribution  of  rainfall  in Sri  Lanka.

Main water resources in Sri Lanka are,   

 ² Rivers, streams
 ² Tanks, reservoirs

 ² ground water (wells, springs, tube wells)

Rivers, streams and   
canals  

these  rivers 

Even  though  Sri 
Lanka is a small island, 
it has about 103   river 
valleys (Map 2.5). Water 
from 
is 
utilized to fulfil the basic 
water 
requirements 
of  the  country.    The 
settlements 
earliest 
were  established      in 
these    river  valleys  to 
obtain  water  for  their 
needs. 

Tanks  and 
reservoirs

    Attention  was 
paid on irrigation  in the 
dry  zone,  even  in  the 
ancient  times,    due  to 
instability of rainfall and 
drying  up  of  the  rivers 
during the dry season. 

Map 2.5  - Rivers in  Sri Lanka

Many  tanks were  constructed  in  the   Dry Zone  in  Sri  Lanka  as  a 
solution for the scarcity of water.  Water collected during the rainy   season 
in    these    tanks      is    used    during  the  dry  season.    Minneriya  ,    Kavudulla,  
Parakrama    Samudra,  Yoda    wewa,    Kala  wewa    and  Nachchaduwa  are 
examples for some  of  the tanks in the  dry  zone.  These   tanks   fulfill   the 
water requirements in those areas even at present.    

Large    reservoirs    were    constructed  in    the    hill    country    wet  zone  
during  recent  times.   Kothmale, Victoria, Randenigala and Rantambe   are   
some of  them. Water  in   these  reservoirs  is  not  only  used  for agriculture, 
but  for  many  other  purposes as well.

Ground water 

Ground  water  is  important    in    districts  such  as  Jaffna,  Kilinochchi, 
Mannar, and Puttalam in Sri Lanka.   Limestone  deposits  of  these  areas can  
retain  a large  quantity  of ground  water. Ground water exists as deep basins. 
Vanathavilluwa and Murukkan basins are the largest ground water deposits in the 
island. Ground  water  can  be  utilized  by   agri  wells,  tube  wells  and  Andiya 
wells  (a  well  with  a  counterpoise  bucket  lift.  They  are  also  known  as  "sweep 
well.)

 ² These  are  found  in  the  Northwestern 

and South Eastern regions.

 ² The  average 

temperature  is  above 
27c.  Therefore    plants  are  adapted  to 
withstand  droughts.  Thorny  trees  with 
pointed    and  thick  leaves  can  be  seen 
(cactus).

 ² Palu,  Weera,  Eraminiya,  Karamba, 
Suriya  are  examples  for  the  types  of 
trees that can be seen in abundance in 
these forests.

Gal  oya,  Kumana,  Udawalawa, Vasgamuwa,  Lunugam Vehera,  Maduru  Oya, 
Somawathie, Horton  Plains, Bundala, Minneriya are some of them. The wildlife 
is  completely  protected  in  these  national  parks.  The  public  can  observe  the 
wildlife and the natural environment. Provisions for scientific study are also 
provided. 

Strict Natural Reserves

Haggala,  Yala  and  Ritigala  are  three  of  the  strict  natural  reserves. 
Human activities are restricted in these reserves. Wildlife resources are solely 
owned by the government and the public is permitted to enter these areas only 
for scientific research purposes.

Sanctuaries

It  is  an  area  reserved  for  the  protection  of  wildlife.  There  are  about 
62  sanctuaries  in  Sri  Lanka.  Weeravilla,  Kataragama,  Kaudulla,  Minneriya, 
Udawatta Kale, Wilapattu, Gal Oya, Trincomalee, Madhu road, Ravana Ella, 
Victoria,  Randenigala,  Rantambe,  Sigiriya,  Bellanvilla,  Madunagala  are

Energy Power

There are several sources used 

to generate energy power,

 ² Bio- mass
 ²
Imported petroleum 
 ²
 Water 
 ² Coal 
 ² Wind
 ² Solar energy

Graph 2.1 - Use of Energy use in Sri Lanka
Source - http://www.info.energy.gov.lk/2015/04/23 

Graph 2.1 shows how these sources of power produce energy in Sri Lanka. 
According to the graph; it is evident that bio-mass and petroleum are used more 
than the other sources of energy.

Bio- mass 

Timber,  Agri  waste,  animal  waste  and  bio  gas  are  the  main  bio-mass 
energy  sources  used  in  Sri  Lanka.  Sri  Lanka  uses  fire  wood  in  abundance  like 
many of the other developing countries. Fire wood from home gardens, fire wood 
from  coconut  cultivations,  rubber  wood,  wood  from  natural  forests  and  forest 
cultivations are used as fuel. Other than the above sources, saw dust, paddy husks, 
fiber waste of sugarcane, charcoal and charcoal obtained from coconut shells are 
also used as fuel.

Solar energy 

Solar  energy  can  be  produced 
easily  in  Sri  Lanka  as  it  is  located  in  the 
tropical  region  which  gets  constant  sun 
light.  Sri  Lanka  has  recently  established 
a  solar  power  station  at  Baruthakanda  in 
Hambanthota  .Other  than  that  solar  cells 
and  solar  panels  are  used  for  producing 
energy for domestic use. The high capital 
required  to  be  invested  initially  to  obtain  solar  power  is  a  challenge  to  a 
developing  country  like  Sri  Lanka.  However  it  is  a  source  of  energy  which 
immensely helps to reduce environmental pollution.

Fig. 2.12 - Solar panel

Wind energy

Wind  is  an  important  source  of 

energy as it is a non-exhaustible resource. 

Similar to the way of utilizing solar energy 

wind  power  too  requires  a  higher  initial 

capital.  But  it  causes  the  minimum  level 

of  environmental  pollution.  Puttalam  and 

Hambanthota  are  the  areas  where  wind 

power stations are located in Sri Lanka.
They supply power to small scale industries 

Petroleum 

Fig. 2.13 - Wind Mills

Petroleum is an important source of energy which is imported. Imported 

crude  oil  is  being  purified  at  Sapugakanda  and  is  distributed  throughout  the 

country  by  the  Kolonnawa  stores.  Petrol,  Diesel,  L.P.  Gas,  Jet  fuel,  Fuel  oil 

and Kerosene oil are extracted from crude oil. Graph 2.2 shows how petroleum 

is consumed in Sri Lanka. According to this graph it is clear that petroleum is 

used mostly in transportation, industries and commercial activities.

The  demand  for  energy 

is 
increasing  day  by  day  in  Sri  Lanka. 
"Sustainable  Energy  Authority" 
is 
established  to  fulfil  this  demand  and 
to  concentrate  on  producing  low  cost 
energy generation. Attention is paid to 
establish small scale energy projects in 
the rural areas. In addition to the above, 
energy  power  is  produced  at  the  coal 
power  stations  in  Kerawalaptiya  and 
Norochcholai.

Hydro electricity 

Hydro  electricity 

is  mostly 
used  for  domestic, 
industrial  and 
commercial  activities  in  Sri  Lanka. 
Only 2000 mega watts can be produced 
in  hydro  power  stations 
in  Sri 
Lanka.  Lakshapana,Wimalasurendra, 
Samanala,  Canyon,  Randenigala, 
Kothmale,  Victoria,  Ukuwela  are 
some  hydro  power  stations  which 
produce 1200 mega watts up to now.

Graph 2.2 - Use of petroleum
Source - Anuual report 2013 Ministry of Finance  

and Planning

The  demand  for  electricity 
increases annually by 7% - 8% in Sri 
Lanka. Increase in the population, rise 
in consumer needs and development in 
industries  have  affected  this  increase 
in  demand  for  energy.  Graph  2.2 
shows  the  consumption  of  electricity 
in Sri Lanka. According to this graph, 
there  is  a  high  demand  for  domestic 
activities and industries.

Problems in consumption of energy sources

 ² High cost. 

 ² Some  of  the  energy  sources  like  wind  and  solar  power  depends  on 

environmental  

factors and a high initial cost has to be spent. 

 ² A high cost is spent for importing crude oil.

 ² More wastage in consumption of energy.

 ² Breakdowns due to natural hazards. 

Importance of the conservation of energy resources

 ² Saves foreign currency that we spend on importing crude oil.

 ² Contribution to the development of the country.

 ² Contribution to the education and social activities.

 ² Consumption  of  energy  sources  sparingly  would  help  to  fulfill  high 

demands. It would also contribute towards sustainable development.

 ² Efficiency in daily activities of the consumers  saves time and minimizes 

the waste of money.

 ² Minimize environmental destruction.

 ² Minimize the effects of natural hazards and climatic changes.

The	main	objective	of	this	lesson	is	to	find	out	information	regarding	the	

size	of	population,	its	growth	and	distribution.

When	population	is	considered	two	important	aspects	can	be	identified,	

 ² Features	such	as	gender,	human	race	and	age	that	receive	at	birth.
 ² Features	such	as	nationality,	religion,	language	and	literacy	that	are	received	

later.

   Man	 who	 determines	 or	 consumes	 all	 physical	 resources	 on	 the	 earth	 is	 a	
resource.	Accordingly,	in	any	country	human	resource	is	very	important	within	the	
development	process.	It	is	so	because	all	activities	of	the	world	is	based	on	man.	
The	population	of	the	world	is	growing	fast.	The	accelerated	growth	of	population	
in	some	countries	is	a	problem	and	in	others,	the	lower	growth	of	population	is	also	
a	 problem.	In	developing	countries	the	growth	of	population	is	relatively	faster	
than	in	developed	countries.	Hence	it	is	important	that	the	population	has	to	be

maintained	at	the	optimum	level	in	any	country,	within	the	development	process.	
For	this	purpose,	it	is	seen	that	in	every	country,	various	strategies	and	plans	are	
prepared	and	also	population	polices	are	followed.	Hence	“population”	has	become	
a	very	important	topic	in	geographical	studies.

The size of world population 

Over	200	years	ago,	the	world	population	has	been	very	low,	however,	at	
present	the	world	population	has	risen	beyond	seven	billion.	Gradually	according	to	
the	rate	that	population	growth	increases,	it	can	be	calculated	that	around	80	million	
people	would	be	added	to	the	world	population.

The Growth of World Population

Though	the	history	of	human	race	that	inhabited	the	world	runs	to	over	a	
million	years,	definite	data	about	population	have	not	been	found	prior	to	last	200	
years.	

Some	conclusions	have	been	arrived	at,	by	means	of	archaeological	evidence	
about	the	early	period.	Even	during	this	period	by	examining	the	data	it	becomes	
clear	that	there	has	been	a	continuous	growth	of	the	world	population.

When	the	historical	data	regarding	world	population,	two	distinguishable	periods	
can	be	identified.

1.	 A	long	period	of	time	between	the	origin	of	mankind	to	around	1750		when	the	

growth	was	slow.

During a long period of time due to the rate of natural growth being at a low 
level,	the	world	population	did	not	develop	fast.	The	reason	behind	this	is	the	
fact	that	though	the	birth	ratio	was	high,	the	mortality	ratio	too	remained	high.

Within	the	short	period	after	1750	AD,	There	was	an	accelerated	growth	of	
population.	During	this	period	of	time	the	mortality	rate	became	low	but	the	birth

Source	-	http://www.usfunds.com/media/images 2014.12.06

The	world	population	which was	a	billion	in	1800	had	reached	seven	billion
in	AD	in	2011.	According	to	graph	3.3	it	is	clear,	that	gradually	the	time	taken	for	
growth	of	population	to	near	a	billion	became	less	and	at	the	present	time	it	has	only	
taken	a	short	period	of	time	like	12	years	for	the	population	to	double.	It	is	expected	
for	the	world	population	to	reach	11	billion	at	the	end	of	this	century. 

Another	special	
feature  of  the  growth 
of world population is 
the	fact	that	during	the	
period	 after	 1950,	 the	
population  growth  in 
developing	 countries	
shows  a  faster  rate 
than	
the	 developed	
countries	(graph	3.4).

Distribution of World Population

How	humans	have	spread	geographically	on	the	surface	of	the	earth	is	known	
as	 population	 distribution.	 There	 are	 only	 a	 few	 regions	 on	 the	 earth	 which	 are	
physically	congenial	to	human	habitation.	Due	to	the	diversity	in	physical	and	human	
factors	and	unequal	distribution	is	visible.	Accordingly,	there	are	densely	populated	
regions	and		sparsely	populated	regions	on	the	earth’s	surface.

Population	 that	 inhabits	 a	 certain	 unit	 of	
land	 is	 	defined	 as	 	population	 density.	
Generally	it	is	shown	as	“number	of	people	
per	square	kilometre”. 

Population	density	=	 Population	

Four	densely	populated	

regions	can	be	identified	
 ² East	Asia	
 ² South	and	South	East	Asia
 ² North	West	Europe

            Land area

 ² North	East	Costal
			Zone	of	U.S.A

The	North	Eastern	coastal	zone	of	the	U.S.A	which	is	identified	as	a	densely	

populated	region	has	become	a	secondary	concentration	at	world	level	at	present.

All	these	population	concentration,	being	found	in	coastal	regions	is	a	special	
feature.	There	are	factors	which	contribute	towards	this	feature	of	people	crowding	
into	these	places.	Physical	surroundings	congenial	to	human	habitation,	transport	
facilities	and	factors	that	are	suitable	for	trade	and	other	economic	activities	are	
some	of	those	factors	that	have	made	people	crowd	to	those	places.	A	large	number	
of	million	cities	(cities	that	have	a	population	over	a	million)	are	located	within	
these	zones.

It	is	only	10%	of	the	land	of	the	world	that	cover	this	population	concentration	but	

that	64%	of	the	world	population	live	within	these	concentrations	is	a	special	feature.

Secondary World population concentrations

In	 addition	 to	 these	 population	 concentrations,	 there	 are	 also	 many	
secondary	population	concentrations	with	a	high density	of	population	in	almost	all
the	countries.

 ² Eastern	Western	and	North	Eastern	coastal	concentration	of	North	America	

(linked	to	the	cities	of	New	York,	Sanfrancisco	and	Boston).

 ² The	Eastern	Coastal	concentration	of	South	America	(linked	to	Rio	de		

	Janeiro	in	Brazil.

 ² Zone	around	the	Nile	Estuary	(linked	to	the	city	of	Cairo	in	Egypt).

 ² Concentration	 of	 Sierra	 Leone,	 Liberia,	 Ivory	 Cost	 and	 Ghana	 in	Western	

Africa

 ²

 About	 80%	 of	 the	 world	 population	 lives	 in	 the	 above	 mentioned	 densely	
populated	areas	They	have	a	population	density	more	than	65	persons	per	
square	kilometer.	

Sparsely populated regions of the world

Out of	 the	 total	 land	 area	 of	 the	 world,	 65%	 of	 the	 land	 area	 has	 a	 low	

population.	

 ² Cold	deserts	(Antarctic	and	Arctic	region)

 ² Hot	deserts	(Sahara	in	the	African	continent,	and	Central	Australia).

 ²

	Mountainous	regions	(Himalayas,	Andes;	Rockies	etc.)

 ² Tropical	Rainforest	Regions	(Amazon,	Congo)

In	 these	 regions	 the	 population	 density	 is	 less	 than	 five	 persons	 per	 square	
kilometer.	Physical	factors	like	rugged	relief	and	climate	has	brought	about	this	condition.

Except	for	the	densely	populates	areas	and	the	sparsely	populated	areas,	the	
other	areas	of	the	world	have	an	average	distribution	of	people.	In	these	regions	the	
population	density	is	between	5	-	65	persons	per	square	kilometer.

Factors  that  contribute  towards  the  unequal  distribution  of 
population

There	are	many	factors	that	have	contributed	for	the	unequal	distribution	of	

population.	These	factors	can	be	divided	into	two	categories;

1.	 Physical	factors

2.	 Human	factors

Physical factors

The	physical	factors	that	affect	population	distribution	are	the	following;

 ²

 Climate   

 ² physical	features	

 ² Drainage

Variations	in	the	climate	on	the	earth	have	positively	and	negatively	affected	
the	population	distribution	in	the	world.	Plains,	river	valleys	and	places	with	fertile	soil
with	a	tropical	or	a	temperate	climate	have	become	areas	with	a	high	population.	The	
Nile	valley	and	the	Indus	valley	are	examples	for	such	regions.

The	land	in	the	Polar	Regions	where	the	temperature	is	low,	and	the	climate	is	
extremely	cold,	the	arid	regions	where	there	is	a	high	temperature	and	a	very	low	rainfall,	
and	regions	where	there	is	a	high	temperature	and	heavy	rainfall	like	the	Amazon	and	
the	Congo	Basins	are	areas	of	low	population.

The	nature	of	the	terrain	is	also	an	important	geographic	feature	determining	
population	distribution.	When	the	terrain	consists	of	a	rugged	relief,	the	area	is	sparsely	
populated.	 For	 instance,	 in	 a	 mountainous	 region,	 population	 density	 is	 low.	Areas	
around	Himalayas,	Andes	and	Rockies	can	be	shown	as	examples.	In	addition	to	these,	
distribution	 of	 natural	 resources	 and	 natural	 vegetation	 are	 also	 factors	 that	 affect	
population	distribution.

Human	as	well	as	physical	factors	have	affected	population	distribution.	Location	
of	different	industrial	centers,	urbanization,	trade	canters	and	ports,	development	of

infrastructure,	 availability	 of	 diverse	 services	 and	 establishment	 of	 administrative	
activities	are	also	important	human	factors	that	affect	population	distribution.

The	effects	of	the	above	factors	are	minimized	with	the	development	in	scientific	

knowledge	and	technology.

        Activities 

1.	 Mark	and	name	the	main	world	population	concentration	zones	and	secondary	

concentration	on	an	outline		map	of	the	world.

2.	 What	factors	have	caused	the	unequal	population	distribution	in	the	world?	
						Describe	with	examples.
3.	 Name	a	million	city	each	for	the	high	density	population	conglomerates.

4.	 Prepare	 a	 list	 including	 problems	 related	 to	 high	 population	 concentration

The Population of Sri Lanka

Data regarding the population of Sri Lanka is collected by the Department 
of Census and Statistics after conducting a survey on population and housing. The 
first formal census was conducted in 1871 and generally, a census is carried out 
once in every ten years.

Although Sri Lanka is a developing country, when certain qualitative features 
like the Infant Mortality Rate, Maternal Mortality Rate, Life Expectancy and Literacy 
are considered, it shows features of a developed country. Therefore, when compared to 
the other developing countries, Sri Lanka remains at a special position. The progress in 
Education and Health sectors has greatly contributed to this situation. 

The main objective of this lesson is to study about the population, the 
size of the population, the growth of population, the distribution of the  
population, the composition of population and the population structure.

Size of the Population

In 2012 the population of Sri Lanka was around 20.2 million. According 
to the census data, the density of Sri Lankan population is 323 persons per square 
kilometer. 

When compared to other countries in the South Asian zone, Sri Lanka holds 
the 5th position in the size of population. However, a similar comparison shows that 
Sri Lanka has the lowest rate of population growth (observe table 4.1).

Population Growth

Population  growth 
is  the  growth  of  population 
within  a  specific  unit  of 
land.  The  census  reports  of 
Sri Lanka from  1871 show 
that  there  is  a  continuous 
growth  in  population.  The 
population  of  Sri  Lanka 
which  was  2.4  million 
according to the first census 
in 1871 has risen up to 20.2 
million in 2012. The continuous growth of population in Sri Lanka is depicted in graph 
4.1. Table  4.2  shows  the  average  annual  growth  rate,  and  the  population  growth 
during the inter-census period from 1871-2012.

There are provincial differences related to population growth in Sri Lanka. 
The population growth in Sri Lanka is relatively higher  in the districts of the Dry 
Zone than in the Wet Zone districts. Though the average growth rate of population 
in Sri Lanka is 0.7% the birth rate in Anuradhapura District is 1.33,in Hambanthota 
it  is  1.17%  and  in  the  Monaragala  District  it  is  1.15%.In  the  Wet  Zone  we  can 
observe a lower rate of population growth. In Colombo it is 0.35%, in Nuwara Eliya 
it is 0.05% and in Badulla it is 0.39%. However, a higher population growth can be 
seen in Kaluthara and Gampaha districts in the Wet Zone, recording a rate of 1.23% 
and 1.02% respectively. According to the census reports, proximity to the Colombo 
district  and  migrations  have  affected  the  higher  rates  of  population  in  these  two 
districts.(http://www.statistics.gov.lk/17/06/2015)

Population Distribution

The population distribution of Sri Lanka shows an unequal nature. When 
the  population  distribution  in  the  provinces  is  considered,  more  than  1/4of  the 
total population, around 28.8% of the population, is concentrated in the Western 
Province. A high population distribution is found in the Central Province (12.6%) 
Southern Province (12.2%) and in North Eastern Province (11.7%) too. The lowest 
population distribution, 5.2%, is found in the Northern province. (Graph 4.3)

Graph 4.3- Population Distribution in the Provinces

Source  –  Population and housing census data, Department of Population and Census 2012.

The Colombo District has the highest population with a population of 2,323,826 
according to the census conducted in 2012.

Many  factors  have  affected  the  high  population,such  as  accumulation  of 
commercial and administrative operations, educational activities and services in this 
district. There is a very large population in the Gampaha District too (2,298,588). 
Migration to the Biyagama and Katunayake Free Trade Zones and selecting Gampaha 
as a convenient residential area due to easy access to Colombo are the main reasons for 
this relatively high population.  Besides Colombo and Gampaha Districts, Kurunegala 
(1,611,407), Kandy (1,368,216), Kalutara (1,214,880), Rathnapura (1,082,299) and 
Galle (1,059,046 ) are the other districts with a high population. The population in 
these  districts  exceeds  one  million.  Mullativu,  Mannar,  Killinochchi  and  Vauniya 
districts in the Northern Province record a very low population.

The Mulativu District has the lowest population which is 92,228.

 The distribution of population can be clearly identified by the population 

density.

According  to  the  census  the  average  density  of  population  is  323,  but  in 
certain districts there is high density of population while in certain other districts 
the population density is extremely low. Map 4.1 shows the population density of

3.  Mention three measures that could be taken to minimize the inequalities in 

the distribution of population in Sri Lanka.

The  population  distribution  in  Sri  Lanka  can  also  be  classified  as  urban, 
rural and plantation population .According to the graph 4.4,the rural population is 
77.3%, the urban population is 18.3% and the plantation population is 4.4% 

Population Composition

Sri  Lanka  is  a  multi-ethnic 
and  multi-religious  country.  The 
population  in  Sri  Lanka  is  divided 
into  five 
categories;  Sinhala,                      
Sri  Lankan  Tamils,  Indian  Tamils, 
Moors and others. Malays, Burghers 
and Europeans represent others. The 
main  religious  communities  are  the 
Buddhist, Hindu, Islam and Christian 
communities.  Graphs  4.5  and  4.6

Population Structure

The population structure of a place shows how the population is divided 
up  between  males  and  females  of  different  age  groups. According  to  the  2012 

census report age and gender structures are shown below.

  Population according to age

Population according to gender  

< 15 yrs - 25.8%

Between 15 -59 - 62.0% 

> 60 yrs - 12.2%

Male - 48.5%

Female - 51.5%

Special features of the population  in Sri Lanka

A special feature in the Sri Lankan population is the gradual decrease of 
young people and the gradual increase of the elderly people. When the popula-
tion of people over 59 years of age in a country or region rises due to increased 
life expectancy  and declining birth rate it is called the population aging. This 
results the gradual decline of the labour force. Sri Lanka, along with many other 
countries  in  the  world  is  facing  the  challenge  of  population  aging.  In  the  same 
manner the percentage of women in the population has also increased. 

By studying the age structure according to gender, we can find information 
regarding the labour force, the number of women who are capable to have children 
and the number of dependents.

Development

Development is a dynamic concept. It is continuous and unending.

The main objective of this chapter is to study the basic concepts of 
development and also the development procedures in Sri Lanka.

The concept of development has changed over time. Until the middle of the 20th century, 
the economic development in a country was termed as ‘development’. (Fig. 5.1) 

Later, “development” became 
a  broader  concept  which 
encompasses  several  fields. 
By the end of the 20th century, 
development  was  not  only 
an  economic  and    physical 
assessment  but  also  included 
for 
components 
human development.

The  meaning  of  the  term  “development”  becomes  clearer  when  some 

definitions of development are studied.

“Social development should take place along with economic development. 
social  development  should  take  place  within  sectors  encompassing  food  and 
nutrition,  health,  education,  housing  social  security,  clothing,  leisure  and  human 
freedom” (1978, UNESCO Declaration ).

“Development  is  a  chain  of  processes  which  includes  factors  related  to 
population, social, cultural and ethical issues”(3rd development decade 1980 – 90 
UNO).

In  the  process  of  development  focus  was  on  protecting  and  conserving 
the  environment,  and  also  on  the  quality  of  the  environment  in  the  80’s  and  in 
the 90’s more focus was on sustainable development. With regard to sustainable 
development, the inter-relationship among the economic, social and environmental 
fields  was  also  incorporated  into  the  concept  of  development. As  the  concept  of 
development has evolved over time, different indicators to measure development 
have also been used.

      Activities

1.  Prepare a simple definition to make the concept of ‘development’ more 

meaningful.

2.  Obtain instructions from teachers and collect other definitions to identify 

the concept of ‘development’.

3.  Indictors to measure Development

Although development has been identified as a concept, different countries 
adopted different indicators to measure it. Once the wide meaning of development 
was  understood,  various  institutions,organizations  and  individuals  introduced 
more qualitative indicators to assess it. 

Indicators to measure Development

Old indicator 

 ² Gross National Product
 ² Per capita income
 ² Gross Nation Development 

Modern indicator

 ² Physical Quality of Life Index(P Q L I)
 ² Human Development Index (H D I)
 ² Human Poverty Index (H P I)
 ² Human Suffering Index (H S I)

It  was  not  possible  to  express  the  real  status  of  ‘development’  by  the 
indicators  used  during  the  early  period.  They  were  adequate  only  to  show  the 
middle  and  low  levels  of  development.  Later    the  concept  developed  further, 
and the Human Development Index (HDI) which was introduced by the United 

72

For free distribution

For free distribution

73

 
 
Nations Development Programme (1990/1999), was used to measure ‘development’. 
Through that indicator, it was possible to avoid the weakness and identify the ‘real 
status of development’. This indicator which includes three basic features of human 
development is a compact indicator. The main indicators used in measuring Human 
Development Indicator are, life expectancy at birth, literacy and purchasing power 
parity tallied with the per capita gross national product.

According to the index which extends 0-1 countries of the world can be 

identified under four groups. 

1.  Countries where human development is very high

2.  Countries where human development is high

3.  Countries where human development is moderate

4.  Countries where human development is low

Sri Lanka, in the year 2012 has obtained 
development index with a value of 0.715 
and had acquired the 92nd place out of 
187 countries of the world.(Central Bank 
Report of Sri Lanka 2012)

Among the SAARC countries, Sri 
Lanka has the highest level of human 
development and is also the only 
SAARC country which is in the high 
development group (Annual Report 
2013. Finance and Plan implementation 
Ministry)  

      Activity

1.  Write two indicators used to measure development in the,

(a)  Early period.

(b) Modern period.

2.  “Development does not mean only the economic development of a country” 

Explain this statement with examples.

3.  “The best indicator to measure the development of a country is the Human 

Development Index” Give reasons to justify this statement.

4.  Describe  briefly  how  the  development  of  a  country  can  be  done  without 

being an obstacle to environment equilibrium.

Sustainable Development

In the past most countries of the world considered progress in the economic 
field as development. This idea being prevalent even during the 21st century has given 
rise to several unfavourable consequences.

Due  to  the  fast  growth  of  population,  increase  in  needs  and  needs 
becoming  more  complexed  new  production  process  has  been  widened.  As 
industrialization took place without proper control, an environmental imbalance 
emerged. Hence attention was paid on sustainable development to prevent the 
imbalance of the environment. The objective of sustainable development is to 
incorporate the management of the development process with the environmental 
management. It focuses on future while upgrading the man’s existence and life 
style.

2.  Present suggestions to solve those problems.

Recent development activities in Sri Lanka

A self - sufficient economy  was  prevalent in Sri Lanka during the hydraulic 
civilization. However, when Sri Lanka became a colony of western nations, it turned 
out to be an import - export economy. After Sri Lanka gained independence, farming 
settlements,  river  –  valley  developments,  multi-  purpose  development  schemes, 
Large scale industries free trade zones, export villages, industrial settlements and 
activities of similar nature took place along diverse fields.

The main focus of the present development process is on  the improvement 
of  infrastructure  facilities.  Improvement  of  infrastructure  facilities  which  is 
considered as a necessity for the development of a country, would also help in the 
human resource development.

Development of Human Resources

In developing a country, man is considered the most important resource. He 
has been able to innovate and produce goods using all the resources of the physical 
environment  by  using  his  intelligence  and  skills.  In  other  words,  man  creates  the 
cultural environment based on the physical environment. Hence it becomes essential 
to  launch  programme  to  improve  man’s  physical  and  mental  skills  as  well  as  his 
spiritual values when developing human resources.

Since ancient times, Sri Lanka has been a country favorable to man. From the 
time Sri Lanka obtained independence, education, health services and security was 
provided free. Certain services are provided with concessions to a selected crowd. 
Sri Lanka is also considered a welfare state because all governments that came into 
power provided common amenities free of charge.

Housing projects, community health programmes, Devineguma, Samudhi and 
Jana Saviya programmes were launched from time to time for human development. 
Maga Neguma project to develop roads at rural level and self employment projects 
were  started  to  bring  about  development  in  the  community.  Under  these  projects 
opportunities to bring about leisure and entertainment were also provided.

The main objective of Regional Development is to act towards human welfare, 
minimizing discriminations, by utilizing the resources and the physical 
environment centered in different areas.

Since  gaining  independence,  for  many  decades,  various  development 
projects have been implemented in order to minimize the gap between the village 
and town. (table 5.1)

Knowledge  based  Development  and  Information  and  Communication 
Technology

Information  and  communication  technology  is  a  service  which  is  used  to 
collect,  store,  analyze  and  exchange  data  in  various  sectors.  Through  this  the 
country and the human society has gained many facilities.

Improvement in relationships within and outside the country.

 ² Opening up more avenues in education.

 ² Opening up direct and indirect employment opportunities and assisting both 

the prospective service providers and the services receivers.

 ² widens the knowledge of ordinary people and also broadens  opportunities 

to fulfill employment needs.

 ² Could contribute quickly in times of disaster (like during cyclones, floods, 

land slides and tsunamis).

 ² With electronic financial system transactions become quick and  safe.

It  is  important  that  a  person  must  be  aware  of  how  he  could  obtain 
the  service  facilities  of  Information  and  communication  technology  and 
also  about  the  equipment  and  tools  to  be  selected  for  such  activities.  It  is 
essential for a person to have a basic education and to know many steps as to 
how  technological  tools  can  be  manipulated,  collect  data,  store  and  analyze 
them and to communicate. In Sri Lanka new avenues have been opened up for 
diverse professions and for those engaged in education through Information and 
Communication Technology.

Natural hazards in the world

The natural environment in the world is subjected to large or small scale 
natural changes periodically. These changes occur without much notice at times. 
Certain  changes  are  quite  fascinating.  Sometimes  they  occur  unexpectedly  and 
could be quite destructive. In whichever way they occur, the natural environment 
has  been  subjected  to  changes  since  the  beginning  of  the  earth.  These  changes 
may continue to occur in future too. Some of these changes occur without human 
influence and there are some instances where these changes are intensified as result 
of human activities. In whatever the way they occur, the possibility to cause damage 
to environment is identified as a natural hazard. 

The objective of this chapter is to discuss the areas where natural hazards 
occur in the world and the problems they cause.

Natural Hazard

A  natural  hazard  is  an  event  in  the 
environment that occurs naturally that could cause 
harm to humans, economic assets or environment.

Natural Disaster

If  the  community  and  their  physical 
resources  and  the  human  activities  are  damaged 
by effects of a certain hazard, such incidents are 
called natural disasters. In other words, a natural 
disaster occurs when natural hazards are activated.
War, terrorism collapsing of buildings, road traffic 
accidents that affect the community are known as 
disasters  but  they  are  not  considered  as  natural 
disasters.

In addition to this categorization, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, 
cyclones and lightning can be identified as natural hazards that occur without any 
human influence while landslides, droughts, floods, bushfires and avalanches can 
be identified as natural hazards that are intensified by the human activities.

     Activities

1.  Identify what a hazard is.

2.  Explain the difference between a natural hazard and a disaster with examples.

3.  Classify the following natural disasters that occur due to natural processes 

and that are intensified due to human activities.

     (floods, tsunamis, cyclones, bushfires, avalanches, earthquakes, droughts  
     and landslides).

Earthquakes

Tremors occur on the surface 
of the Earth as a result of the 
shock waves generated by 
the movement of rock masses  
within the crust of the Earth 
particularly near boundaries 
of tectonic plates. When they 
occur suddenly and bring about a 
vast destruction, they are called 
earthquakes.

Causes for Earthquakes

Fig. 6.4 – An incident of an earthquake

The sudden release of the stored energy in the Earth's crust, when it exceeds the 
capacity, it causes Earthquakes. The earth’s crust is made up of many tectonic plates 
which are connected to each other. There are seven main plates and a number of minor 
plates (Map 6.1). These tectonic plates drift towards different directions and earthquakes 
are caused as they collide with each other causing powerful movements at the margins. 
Earthquakes also occur due to faults that are created on the earth’s surface or during 
volcanic activity.

Magnitude of earthquakes

A  seismometer  is  used  to  measure  the  intensity  or  the  magnitude  of  the 
earthquakes.  The  seismic  information  received  through  that  is  recorded  in  the 
seismograph. The  values  indicated  can  be  included  in  a  scale. This  method  was 
introduced by Charles F Richter in 1935. Hence, it is called the Richter scale.

Table 6.1 indicates the magnitude of earthquakes and the results according 

to the values on the Richter scale.

Major earthquake zones of the world

When observing map 6.2 the plate boundary zones can be identified as the 
areas  where  earthquakes  occur  constantly.  The  map  6.2  shows  four  major  zones 
where earthquakes take place in the world.

A - The area that spreads around 
the  Pacific  Ocean.  (Pacific  Ring 
of Fire)

B - Mediterranean-Himalaya 
mountain zone.

C - Mid- Atlantic oceanic ridge.

 Landslides and sinking of lands take place in mountainous regions.

 ² When  earthquakes  occur  in  the  ocean  bed  they  cause  Tsunamis  and 

destroy the coastal areas the nearby countries.

 ² Damage to human life and property, destruction of the natural drainage 

system and infra-structure facilities.

      Activities

1.  What is known as an earthquake?

2.  Name the major earthquake zones located in the world and shade these areas 

on a world map.

Tsunami

The high and lengthy strong ocean waves caused as a result of the different 
tremors origin at the ocean bed, that approach the coastal areas are called 
Tsunamis.

Phenomena that create Tsunami waves

 ² Massive earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that occur in the ocean bed.
 ² Landslides that occur in the ocean bed.
 ² Fall of meteorites into the sea.
 ² Falling of large ice sheets from the glaciers into the sea.
 ²

  Powerful explosions made by man on the surface of the oceans. 

Among them, the major factor that causes Tsunami waves is the earthquakes 
that occur in the ocean beds. As a result of sudden and powerful tremors occurring 
on  plate  margins,  the  ocean  water  is  disturbed  and  creates  large  tidal  waves  on 
the  surface  of  the  ocean.  When  these  waves  approach  land  areas  their  height  is 
increased  gradually  and  they  convert  into  Tsunami  wave  near  the  coast.  These 
Tsunami waves cause severe destruction to the coastal areas. Fig. 6.5 shows how 
Tsunami waves are formed.

 Write down three major causes of Tsunami.

3.  Name the areas that face Tsunami disasters in the world and mark them on a 

world map.

4.  Explain the damage caused by a Tsunami citing examples.

Volcanoes

When the magma in the Earth's interior escapes through the cracks and the 
weak areas in the tectonic plate margins, it is called a volcanic eruption. After the 
eruption, the magma that flows on the surface of the earth is called lava.

At  the  beginning,  smoke,  ashes,  different  gases  and  pieces  of  lava  are 
ejected to the atmosphere and at the same time lava flows through the crater (vent) 
of the volcano. The lava that erupted from the crater of the volcano flows around 
the  volcano  and  deposits  as  cool  solid  layers. After  that,  the  volcano  becomes 
dormant. Although  it  is  a  dormant  volcano  it  may  become  re-active  causing  a 
hazardous situation. 

When  a  volcano  erupts  a  huge  damage  could  be  caused  to  human  life, 

property, as well as to infra- structure facilities.

The  effect  of 

the  various 
substances  emitted  into  the  atmosphere 
during  a  volcanic  eruption  cannot  be 
ignored..  In  addition  to  that  it  could 
result  short  term  changes  in  weather 
conditions  and  could  obstruct  air  travel 
too  as  the  ash  plumes  spread  in  the 
atmosphere.

Distribution of volcanoes

Fig. 6.6 - A volcano Eruption

Volcanoes are mostly found on tectonic plate boundaries. they are also 
found  on  plate  subduction  areas  and  in  zones  located  out  of  plate  boundary 
areas. 70% of active volcanoes are located in the Pacific plate margins around 
the Pacific Ocean. This is famous as the Pacific Ring of Fire.

Drought

The  main  reason  for  drought  is, 
unexpected  delay  in  receiving  rain  for  a 
number of days.

The  British  weather  scientists  define 
drought  as  a  continuous  time  period  of  15 
days  without  rain.  It  is  the  duration  of  30 
days  in  Canada.  In Australia  the  number  of 
days is greater than this. Accordingly, various 
countries in the world define drought in different ways. However, it is apparent 
that the main reason for drought is the delay in receiving rain.  

Fig. 6.9 - An area affected by drought

People  have  to  face  the  hazard  of  drought  when  the  water  supply  is  not 
sufficient due to the changes in pattern of rainfall or due to decrease of the amount of 
rainfall. This hazard can be minimized to a certain level if water is provided.

 ² Central African Sahel zone.
 ² Midwest zone in North America.
 ² Central Australia.
 ² The areas of Hyderabad, Gujarat and Maharashtra in India.

 ² North western part of China.

Cyclones 

The hard blowing wind spinning fast in a swirl originating with an intense centre of 
low pressure on the surface of the tropical oceans is called a whirlwind or cyclone.

A whirlwind is the origin of cyclones. The strong winds that gush into the 

land from the ocean cause severe damage and eventually die out.

The sea waves become stormy waves 
as a result of blowing the cyclone at a high 
speed towards the land from the ocean. The 
coastal landscape would be affected by this 
and  incur  heavy  losses  in  the  surrounding 
areas. A  disaster  condition  may  prevail  due 
to heavy rain and strong winds.

Areas affected by cyclones

The land areas located around the 
oceans where cyclones may occur can be 
identified as areas affected by this hazard. 
The  tropical  areas  which  have  a  specific 
weather  condition  such  as  Indonesia, 
Southern  coastal  areas  of  the  United 
States  of  America  and  the  surrounding 
areas  of  the  Bay  of  Bengal  can  be  cited 
as examples. Various names are used for 
these whirl winds according to the surrounding areas of each coast.

77 Natural hazards in Sri Lanka

Many  factors  such  as  Sri  Lanka  being  an  island,  the  internal  landscape  , 
location  within  a  tropical  climatic  zone  and  the  high  population  affect  the    the  
occurrence of many natural hazards in Sri Lanka.

 Landslides, floods, cyclones, lightning, and Tsunami are the major natural hazards 
that occur in Sri Lanka.

Studying about the natural hazards that occur in Sri Lanka, along with their 
impacts, methods to face them and ways of mitigating their impact, is the 
objective of this chapter.

If  we  could  maintain  the  manmade  human  landscape,  built  to  meet  the 
demands  of  the  community,  free  of  hazards,  it  would  help  in  accelerating  the 
socio  economic  development  of  the  country.  It  is  evident  that  the  frequency  in 
the  occurrence  of  hazard  like  landslides,  floods,  droughts  are  increasing  in  Sri 
Lanka. Building the human landscape without paying any concern to the physical 
environment and irregular management of the environment have adversely affected 
in intensifying such hazards.

Landslides

The sudden movement of soil, rocks 
and vegetation cover on a slope in an 
elevated area towards the lower areas 
can be called a landslide.

Sri Lanka as the areas threatened with landslide risks.

3.  Explain in brief the damages caused by landslides.

Floods

Floods  can  be  identified  as  the  most 
common  natural  hazard  in  Sri  Lanka.  Floods 
can be seen in the areas that receive heavy rain 
and  in  the  river  basins  and  the  areas  around 
the  estuaries  of  Kelani,  Kalu,  Gin,  Nilwala, 
Mahaoya  and  Mahaweli  rivers.  Floods  occur 
suddenly as a result of a rise in the water level 
of rivers and overflowing the either sides of the valleys and also as a consequence 
of obstructions of water ways. This hazard can be mostly seen in urban areas close 
to low lands. The human activity in the areas blocking the places where water drains 
naturally during heavy rains, intensifies the risk of floods in such areas.

Cyclone

The depressions in the atmosphere 
that  develop  in  the  areas  around  the  Bay 
of Bengal move as cyclones towards India 
or Sri Lanka. In Sri Lanka, cyclones occur 
mostly in the Northern and Eastern regions 
during the period from October to December. 
Map 7.2 indicates several districts which are 
mostly  affected  by  cyclones.  Even  though 
heavy  damages  are  not  reported  frequently,  the  cyclone  that  hit  the  country  in 
November 1978 incurred heavy losses and many lives were lost too.

Drought

Various countries in the world have different definitions related to ‘drought’. 
There  are  different  ideas  presented  in  Sri  Lanka  too. According  to  the  report  of 
climatic changes prepared by the Ministry of Forest resources and Environment, 
the duration of receiving less than 75% of expected rainfall in Sri Lanka is called 
the time duration that causes drought. However, the time periods of droughts in Sri 
Lanka vary in different areas.

The  dry  zone  of  Sri  Lanka  experiences  a 
drought  condition  once  in  every  three  or 
four  years.  It  is  identified  that  drought 
condition that affects the whole Sri Lanka 
occurs in every ten years. 

Fig. 7.4 - Cultivated land affected by 
drought

Reasons that cause droughts.

 ² Climatic changes.
 ²
Increase in global warming.
 ² Pollution of the atmosphere.
 ² Destruction of forests.                             
 ² Unexpected scarcity of water.

Steps that can be taken to minimize the impact of a drought.

 ² Storage of rain water.
 ² Conservation of water sources and protection of the vegetation cover.
 ² Using water sparingly.
 ² Preference towards crops with water efficiency.

      Activities

1.  Mark and shade districts which are affected by droughts in a district map of 

Sri Lanka.

2.  Name some crops resistant to droughts at least to a certain extent.
3.  “Human  activities  affect  the  occurrence  of  droughts  more  than  natural 

causes” Explain this with reference to two examples.

Lightning

Lightning  is  a  natural  phenomenon 

which  is  identified  as  a  very  common 

hazard in Sri Lanka. Especially during inter 

monsoonal  period  with  the  convectional 

process,  lightning  can  be  seen  throughout 

the island.

       The reason for lightning is the higher 

cumulus  clouds  forming  under  unstable 

Fig. 7.5 - Lightning

and humid atmospheric conditions during inter monsoonal periods. The electric 

discharge of positive and negative charges within the cumulus clouds is called 

lightning.

Lightning can be divided into three categories. They are,

 ² Cloud lightning         (discharges between clouds and clouds)

 ² Air lightning              (discharges between clouds and space)

 ² Earth lightning           (discharges between clouds and the earth)

More damages are caused by earth lightning that occurs between the clouds 
and the earth. Although earth lightning may occur at any place in Sri Lanka, it has 
been identified more damage would cause in the areas that receive inter monsoonal 
rain in abundance.

               Lightning causes more damages like loss of lives and destruction of 
property in Sri Lanka. According to the reports of the Disaster Management Center 
about 50 lives are lost annually due to lightning .In addition to that; taller buildings 
and electrical appliances are damaged mostly at the occasions of this hazard.

Steps that could be taken to prevent from lightning.

 ² Use earth wires connected to the electric circuits of buildings and houses.
 ²
Install lightning conductors on taller buildings.
 ² Fix a trip switch to the electric supply at home.
 ² Disconnect electric and electronic appliances when lightning.
 ² Avoid staying in open spaces or under single trees.
 ² Avoid touching metals when lightning.
 ² Be alert and making others also aware about the hazard during a period of 

strong lightning.

      Activities

1.  Mention the time period that lightning occurs mostly in Sri Lanka.

2.  Explain the damages caused by lightning. 

Tsunami

Sri  Lanka  had  to  undergo  the  tragic  experiences  of  Tsunami  catastrophe 
on the 26th of December 2004. This hazard can be considered as the most tragic 
natural hazard that occurred in the recent history not only to Sri Lanka but in many 
countries in the Southeast Asia.

Tsunami waves were triggered after an earthquake that occurred on the plate 
boundaries located close to Sumatra islands, in an area known for earthquakes with 
a higher intensity. These tsunami waves tragically destructed the Northern, Eastern 
and Western coastal areas in Sri Lanka.

death  toll recorded  was  about  35000 while 500000  were recorded  as displaced. 
Property and ecosystems with a immense value were too destroyed.

Steps that can be taken to minimize the damage caused by Tsunami

 ² Limiting construction work close to the 

coast.

 ² Protection  of  the  natural  eco-systems 

 ²

located close to the coast.
Installing  tsunami  warning  systems 
and community awareness.

 ² Soon after receiving tsunami warnings, 
evacuate  from  the  coastal  areas  and 
move to a place with a higher elevation.
If there are no elevated places in the vicinity, move to an upper floor of a 
building constructed with reinforced concrete.

 ² Listening to media.
 ² Listening to tsunami warning systems.
 ² Evacuate  the  coast  when  the  sound  of  an  earth  quake  is  heard  without 

waiting for the tsunami warning.

      Activities

1.  Explain what a tsunami is.

2.  Shade and name the districts which were affected by tsunami hazard on the 

26th of December 2004 in a district map of Sri Lanka.

Disaster Management Programme in Sri Lanka.

The disaster management programme became dynamic with the tsunami that 
struck on the 26th of December 2004 in Sri Lanka. A formal institutional structure 
was established with new laws, rules and regulations for disaster management in 
the year 2005.

 ² Establishment of a ministry related to disaster management.
 ² Establishment  of  a  National  Disaster  Management  Centre  (NDMC)  with 

political leadership.

 ² Establishment  of  a  Disaster  Management  Centre  (DMC)  under  a  director 

general.

 ² Establishment  of  a  Disaster  Management  Centers  in  divisional  secretariat 

divisions and district levels. 
Implementation of school programmes related to protection from hazards.

 ²

               Through the above institutional structure, many community services are 
performed  related  to  hazardous  situations  that  occur  at  any  place  in  Sri  Lanka. 
Prevention from hazards, hazard mitigation, responding and rehabilitation activities 
related  to  them  are  included  in  the  management  programme.  Not  only  the  state 
sector but community based organizations and non-government organizations also 
actively contribute towards disaster management activities in Sri Lanka.

Disaster Management Cycle

Disaster management cycle is the model that indicates the process of hazard 
management. It shows a dynamic management activity from the pre-hazard level to 
the post – hazard level.

Response

Although responses may change according to each hazard the necessity of 

responding to any hazard is compulsory.

•  Assuring the protection of the community subjected to the hazard.

•  Providing medical treatments.

•  Protection of physical property as much as possible.

•  Providing temporary lodging.

•  Providing food.

Recovery

This  includes  the  necessity  of  rehabilitation  of  the  environment  and  the 

people  subjected  to  the  hazard.  Planning  long  term  and  short  term  actions  is  

significant in the recovery process. This encompasses recovery of people who were 

both physically and mentally victimized by the hazard.

Mitigation

The steps taken to minimize the hazard are similar to the steps related to 

preparation. However, the risk of the hazard can be minimized through other steps.

Installing warning systems.

Climatic Changes

Flora and fauna in a particular region is adapted to the climatic conditions 

prevalent in that region. The human activities too are adapted to the climatic and the 

other physical conditions in that region. The modern man is advanced in science and 

technology even to carry out certain human activities under controlled environmental 
factors. Some human activities are not eco-friendly and have harmful effects on the 

environment. Some examples are,

 ² Mining of mineral oil resources in the North Sea.
 ² Air conditioning.
 ² Commercial dairy farming.
 ² Burning of fossil fuels.
 ² Deforestation
 ² Nuclear experiments.
 ² Disposal of solid waste.

The  above  activities  have  caused  changes  in  many  cyclic  processes  in  the 
physical environment. Thus we have to face many unfavourable consequences such 
as Global warming. Climatic changes are quite significant among them.

Certain environmental processes take place gradually and in a cyclic manner. 
When they occur suddenly, it brings about changes in the atmospheric composition 
and results global warming. This condition eventually creates extreme conditions in 
the climate.

As a result, changes have occurred in patterns of winds, droughts, cyclones, 
duration  of  receiving  rainfall  and  the  intensity  of  rainfall  and  environmental 
temperature. These  changes  can  be  called  climatic  changes. Accordingly,  the  long 
term  or  short  term  changes  occurring  in  the  general  climatic  pattern  on  earth  are 
identified as climatic changes.

 The objective of this chapter is to study the climatic changes, phenomena that cause 
climatic changes, impact of the climatic changes on physical and human environment 
and about the global agreements and conventions related to this issue.

  The short wave solar radiation from the Sun is reflected back to space as long 
wave radiation (terrestrial radiation). Due to the effect of greenhouse gases in the 

atmosphere the rising terrestrial radiation remain in the earth’s atmosphere and 

this is called the natural greenhouse effect. An atmosphere conducive for for the 

living beings is created on earth due to this phenomenon. However, due to various

human  activities,  an  exceeding 

amount  of  greenhouse  gases  is 
emitted to the atmosphere. These 

gases absorb more radiation and 

in turn warm up the atmosphere.   

This  causes  an 

increase 

in 

global  warming.

Minimizing climatic changes 

  Citizens in any country do not like to stay away from the lifestyle they 
enjoy,  personally  or  commonly,  or  to  be  satisfied  by  fulfilling  their  needs 
at the minimum level. If they do, it is possible to refrain from unfavourable 
environment restricted activities or to minimize such human activities.

  Following  are  some  of  the  activities  that  can  be  done  to  minimize 

climatic changes.

 ² Less consumption of energy sources that emit green house gases.
 ² Motivation to use energy sources such as wind and solar power.
 ² Using organic manure for crop cultivation instead of chemical fertilizers.
 ² Management of solid waste materials.
 ² Expansion of afforestation.
 ²
 ² Using common transportation facilities.  

Introduction of mixed crops and multi crops.

Steps that have been taken to minimize climatic changes at a 

global level.

Both  developed  and  developing  countries  are  continuously  engaged  in 
development  activities. While  employing  development  strategies  each  and  every 
country  has  contributed  towards  global  warming  and  occurrence  of  climatic 
changes.  Contribution  to  the  climatic  changes  varies  according  to  the  capacity 
of energy and fossil fuel consumption of each country. The “World Conservation 
Strategies” were prepared by the “International Forum of Nature Conservation” as

a result of understanding this situation. Funds are provided by the United Nations 
Environment Protection programme and the World Wild Life Fund for that mission. 
They have three main objectives;

 ² To maintain essential ecological processes and life-support systems.
 ² To preserve genetic diversity.
 ² To  ensure  the  sustainable  utilization  of  species  of  flora  and  fauna  and  eco 

systems

Following are the milestones of this programme.

 ² Stockholm Summit held in 1972.
 ² Brundtland Commission Report. (1987)
 ² Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 (International Conference on 

Environment and Development).

It was proposed to prepare a programme on environment and development 
for  the  21st  century  at  the  conference  held  at  Rio  de  Janeiro  in  1992,  with  the 
participation of delegates from 172 countries.

Sri Lanka too agreed to the decisions made at this conference as a member 
country. As a result, a number of programmes were proposed to be implemented 
simultaneously at national level for the preparation of better surroundings in the 
environment.

 ² Minimizing activities that emit CFC gas and complete elimination after 2000.
 ² Vehicle emission tests.
 ² Solid waste management.
 ² Minimizing the use of fossil fuels.
 ² Protection of global bio-diversity by protecting animal and plant species.
 ² Consumption  of    regenerating  energy  (solar  power  ,wind  power  and  hydro

Inter-governmental Panel on Climatic Change. (IPCC)

Climatic  changes  is  a  theme  which  has  drawn  attention  of  many  in  the 
world  recently. Therefore,  the  United  Nations  Organization  established  the  Inter 
governmental Panel on Climatic Change (IPCC) in 1988.The membership for this 
organization is granted for those members of World Meteorological Organization 
and  the  United  Nations  Environment  Project  (UNEP). At  present,  120  countries 
have received the membership of this organization. According to the programme 
Convention of the United Nations the organization of Inter governmental Panel of 
Climatic Changes provides reports about the climatic changes of these areas.

The Nobel Prize was awarded to both IPCC and ALGORE in 2007 for the reports 
published on world climatic changes.

99 1: 50 000 Topographical Maps of

 Sri Lanka

A map is very important to have a total study of the landscape of a particular 
area.  You have already studied about maps, basic features of thematic maps and 
topographical maps and peripheral information of maps in Grade 10.

 The objective of this chapter is to study about the physical and cultural features in 
topographic maps, learn to draw a cross section of a physical landscape and learn to 
interpret maps in this lesson.

There  are  many  features  such  as  the  topographic  features  ,  drainage,  coastal 
features,  natural  vegetation,  administrative  boundaries,  transport  routes,  cultivation, 
settlements and several other specific features on a mapped area of topographical maps,. 
These features can be classified as natural made and manmade features. They are also 
known as physical features and cultural features respectively.

When you learn about the peripheral information and information on the map 
face  of  a  1:50,000  topographical  map  you  will  be  able  to  read  the  map  and  obtain 
complete knowledge about the mapped area.
complete knowledge about the mapped area.

Identify and name the physical and cultural features found in the  area surrounding  
of your school or home.

The physical features of a 1: 50 000 topographic map

Features which are naturally formed on land are known as physical features.

These physical features can be divided into four main parts.

 ² Relief features.
 ² Drainage features.
 ² Coastal features.
 ² Natural vegetation.

The Relief Features

Different landforms on the surface of the Earth are represented by contour 
lines on 1: 50 000 topographic maps. The places with equal height are marked after   
measuring the height of a certain area .Then lines are drawn on a map connecting 
the places with equal height. These lines are known as contour lines. 

The value of each contour line is marked by height. The contour line interval 
is 20 m. The index contour lines such as 100 m, 200 m, and 300 m are drawn as 
dark thick lines in brown. Intermediate contour lines between two index contour 
lines are marked in light brown at 20 meter intervals. All the contour lines are not 
marked with the height. In mountainous areas where there are more contour lines, 
the index contour lines like 100, 200, 300  are marked with the value and the values 
of intermediate contour lines  are determined according to the interval  between two 
index contour lines. 

As the contour line gap becomes wide in areas with extending plains, spot 
height  is  shown  to  get  the  idea  about  the  elevation  of  the  region. The  height  of 
the  mountain  peaks  are  also  shown  by  trigonometrical  stations.  There  is  a  note 
on      contour  lines  in  peripheral  information  of  the  topographical  maps.  Various 
lands forms like plains, mountain ranges, plateaus, valleys, spur and slopes   can be 
identified   by studying height,  gap and spreading  of the contour lines.

 Identifying Relief Features

Plain

A  plain  is  a  flat  area 
on the land. Flat land can be 
identified on a map either by 
the limitation of contour lines 
to  few  or  by  the  wide  gap 
between  two  contour  lines. 
The change of the height that 
occurs here and there, in these 
regions can be understood by 
the spot height.

Undulating Land

The region of a plain that consists 
of  slightly  higher  lands  and  low  lands 
is  known  as  undulating  land.      Such 
undulating feature can be found mostly 
in  the  coastal  regions  of  Sri  Lanka.  
The  undulating  lands  on  maps  can  be 
identified  by  the  location  of  contour 
lines that show the scattered high lands 
between two contour lines with a wide 
interval.

A  land  with  a  higher  elevation 
located in a particular area is known as a 
highland. More contour lines are located 
in  a  high  land  and  they  run  very  close 
to  each  other.  Different  landforms  like 
mountain ranges, plateaus and spurs are 
found in a high land.

Valley and Spur

A Valley is an elongated low land 
mostly  located  between  two  high  lands 
with a river flowing through. Valleys can 
be  identified  in  low  lands  as  well  as  in 
high lands. Wide shallow valleys in low 
lands and narrow deep valleys in high land regions are seen. Since the contour 
lines extend towards the high land in a V shape, a valley can be identified easily.

Fig. 9.3 - Highland. Valley Spur

The part of high land that extends towards the low land with contour 
lines is called spur.  In a spur the contour lines spread pointing towards the 
low land.

Mountain Range/ Ridge

High lands that extend with a narrow elongated shape are known as mountain 
ranges. Such mountain ranges are mostly found in the central hills of Sri Lanka. Lands

Mountain Peak

The height of the peaks located 
in  a  mountain  range  is  shown  by  a 
trigonometrically  station.  There  may 
be  several  peaks  located  at  different 
heights in a mountain range.

Isolated Hill and Conical Hill

Solitary 

regions 
low 
scattered in flat lands are called isolated 
hills.  Generally  they  are  around  100  to 
200 meters in height. When an isolated 
hill is located in the shape of a cone, it is 
known as conical hill.  In a conical hill 
contour lines extend in circles.

Slopes

Fig. 9.6 - Conical Hill

High  lands  can  have  different 
types  of  slopes.  These  slopes  can  be 
identified by the gap among the contour 
lines and by how they spread. If contour lines extend at a distance from each 
other gentle slope is shown and if the contour lines extend close to each other 
a  steep  slope  is  shown.  Location  of  contour  lines  very  close  to  each  other  is 
a  special  feature  of  an  escarpment.    On  some  occasions  .contour  lines  in  an 
escapement extend very closely like over lapping. Waterfalls are formed mostly, 
associated with escarpments. Sometimes, gentle slopes and steep slopes could 
be found even on the same slope.  When a gentle slope is located on the higher 
part of a slope and a steep slope is located on the lower part of it, it is called 
convex slope.

Drawing a Cross Section of a physical Landcape 

The plan that is drawn to a scale to show the profile of a certain Physical Landscape 
on a line drawn joining two places on a map is called a cross section.

The cross section is useful to identify the Physical Landscape of a certain area 

clearly.

Map  9.1 - Topographic Map

 Drawing a Cross Section

Step one.

 ² First draw a line (A-B line) joining two relevant places as shown on the 

map 9.1.

 ² To draw the base line, draw a line equal to the length of the A-B line. 
Draw  two  vertical  lines  at  the  ends  of  this  line  and  mark  the  vertical 
scale  on  one  line.  While  the  scale  of  the  map  is  the  horizontal  scale, 
suitable scale can be used for the vertical scale. Consider the elevation 
of  the  mapped  area  when  determining  it. According  to  the  above  map, 
elevation of the mapped area is seen just above 0- 600m. It is appropriate 
to use 1 cm=100 m( 2mm=20 m) as vertical scale to show this elevation. 
Draw the sufficient number of horizontal lines parallel to the base line to 
that interval so as to show the relevant elevation.

Step two.

 ² Take a sheet of paper for the creation of the cross section and line up an edge 

of it on the A-B  line  drawn on the map.

 ² Mark  the  places  where  contour  lines  meet  the  base  line  with  dots  or  dash   

alone the edge of the paper and write the values of the contour lines.

Step Three

 ² Line  up  the  edge  of  the  paper  on  the  base  line  of  the  graph  you  have 
drawn.  Next, move the edge of the paper to the 100 m line and marked 
the places where 100 m height is marked, on the scale line of the graph 
by a dot.. Next take the paper to the 200 m scale line and mark the places 
as you have done before. So mark all the heights on the relevant scale 
lines of the graph.

 ² When all the places have been marked   join the dots by a line. When the 
mountain  top  is  drawn  draw  the  line  there  without  touching  the  above 
scale line in to a shape of a peak.. In low valleys, draw the line without 
touching the lower line moving downwards from the dotted places in to 
a shape of a valley.

 ² To complete the drawing of the cross section join the line to two vertical 

lines considering the elevations of beginning and ending points.

 ² By  shading  the  part  that  shows  the  landform  with  light  brown,  the  

landscape is clearly shown.

slope and conical hill following the instructions given by the teacher.

The Drainage Features

A river originates as a small stream in a hilly region. When several small 
water  ways  get  collected  a  tributary  is  formed  and  when  several  tributaries  join 
together the main river is formed.

Fig.  9.11 - River system

When  the  main  river, 
all its tributaries and streams 
connected  to  the  tributaries 
are  considered  together,  it  is 
called  a  river  system.  There 
are  103  main  river  systems  in 
Sri Lanka.

Most rivers begin in the 
central  hills  and  flow  through 
the  low  plains  following  the 
relief of the land before falling 
into  the  sea  at  different  places 
in the island.

Due to the flow of the rivers through longitudinal valleys located between 
two mountain ranges or between two high lands and through transverse valleys that 
run across mountain ranges, different types of drainage patterns are formed.

Catchment area and Watershed

The  region  from  where  a 

certain  river      collects  water  or 

the  region  that  feeds  a  river  is 

the catchment area. When several 

tributaries flow into the main river 

in  the  catchment  area,  the  main 
river is fed. The central hill is the 

catchment  area  for  most  rivers 

of  Sri  Lanka.  The  boundary  that 

divides two river systems is called 

water  shed.  When  rivers  flow  on 

either  side      of  one  mountain, 

the  top  of  that  mountain  range 

becomes the water shed.

Waterfall

Most  often,  when  rivers 
flow, even with a less volume of 
water,  through  narrow  valleys 
in  high  lands  with  escarpments 
waterfalls  are  formed.  Several 
waterfalls  formed  in  such  a 
manner  can  be  seen  in  the 
central  hills.  Waterfalls  such 
as  Dunhinda,  Bambarakanda, 
Diyaluma  can  be  shown  as 
examples.

Meander

The  feature  that  is  known  as  a 
meander is formed when a river begins to 
flow in a circular path due to the blocking 
of  the  river  course  by  the  deposition  of 
the river burden as river flows very slowly 
through wide valleys in flat areas.

Marshy Land

Marshy lands are formed due to the 
logging of water in the low lands associated 
with rivers.  Blocking of the water ways of 
rivers  too  is  a  cause  for  the  formation  of 
marshy lands. Collection of rain water in low lands also causes to form marshy lands. 
Marshy lands are represented in topographical maps by a special symbol.

 Fig. 9.14 - Marshy land, Meander and 
Braided river

Braided River

When  features  like  small  islands  are  formed  in  the  river  due  to  the 
deposition of sediments in the middle of the river while the river flows very 
slowly through low plains, it is called a braided river.

Distributaries 

A river which  flows  across  low land at slow speed divides itself into  several 
channels, flows is into main river after a short distance, is called cut off channels.  
Some rivers divide themselves into several channels at the river mouth and   flow 
to the sea.  These channels are known as distributaries.  Eg. River Mahaveli flows 
into the sea through several distributaries at Trincomalee. 

Drainage Patterns

The  drainage  pattern  of  a 
certain area is formed by the relief and 
the composition of rocks of that region.  
The  drainage  pattern  that  is  formed 
due to the flow of rivers into different 
directions  from  the  high  land  where 
they  get  originated  is  called  radial 
drainage  pattern.  The  total  drainage 
pattern  of  Sri  Lanka  that  consists  of

a central hills in the mid of the island 
and  low  lands  around  it  shows  the 
features of the radial drainage pattern.

If  the  tributaries  of  a  river 
system  join  the  main  river  in  the 
shape of   branches of a tree is called 
a  dendritic  drainage  pattern.    In  most 
of  the  river  systems  of  Sri  Lanka  a 
dendritic drainage pattern can be seen. 

When the tributaries of a river 
system meet the main river at a right 
angle  forming  the  shape  of  a  grid,  it 
is called trellis  drainage pattern. This 
drainage  pattern  can  be  identified  in 
the south western plain of Sri Lanka. 
The  location  of  the  longitudinal  and 
transverse  valleys  associated  with 
the  parallel  ridges  located  in  the 
south western region of the island has 
contributed for the formation of such 
drainage pattern.

The  main  rivers  like  Kelani, 
Kalu  flow  from  the  central  hills 
through  the  transverse  valleys  of  the 
south  western  parallel  ridges  and 
the  tributaries  join  the  main  rivers  
flowing through the longitudinal valleys located among the parallel ridges. On the 
1:  50  000  topographic  maps  of  South  Western  region  of  Sri  Lanka  such  trellis  
drainage pattern can be seen.

 Fig.  9.17 -  The Dendritic Drainage Pattern

Coastal Features

The relief features can be seen in the coastal areas on 1:50 000 topographic 

maps too belong to the physical features.

Lagoon,  bay,  head/point,  sandbar,  river  mouth  islands  are  the  distinct 
topographical features of the coastal region. These coastal features are formed due 
to the erosion and deposition that occur along the coast line.  Rivers flowing from 
the inland, structure of the rocks of the coast line and tides are some factors that have 
led to the formation of coastal features.

  A 
water  on  all  sides  is  known 
island.  In  Sri  Lanka 
as 
the  North,  West  and 
on 
Southwestern there are many 
such islands located close to 
the  coast  line  of  Sri  Lanka. 
Delfts, Kayts,  Nainativu  are 
few    islands  located  in    the 
coastal region of North.

Lagoon
  The  topographical  feature 
that  is  formed  when  the  sea 
indents  towards  the  land  and 
is separated by a sand belt but 
with a small opening towards 
the  sea      is  termed  a  lagoon. 
Eg: Negombo, Batticaloa and 
puttalam

Point/ Head

The  narrow 
coastal  belt  jutting  out  to 
the  sea  is  known  as  “point”  
Dondra  Head,  Point  Pedro 
and  Sangamankanda  Point 
are examples.

Bay
The  indented  area  of  the 
sea towards the land with a 
bigger opening to the sea is 
a bay. Arugam Bay, Kottiyar 
Bay,  and  Weligam  Bay  can 
be shown as examples. Bays 
are  used  as  fishing  habours 
where  small  fishing  boats 
are anchored.

River Mouth

The place where a river flows 
to  the  sea  is  a  river  mouth.  
There  are  sand  banks  formed 
near the mouth of the river and 
also marshy lands close to the 
lands of the river mouth.

Sand bank

The  sand  brought  by 
the  waves  and  the  rivers 
being deposited along the 
coastal  belt  leads  to  the 
formation of  sand banks.

A topographic map represents the total landscape of a region. While the physical 
landscape can be understood by the identification of physical features, human 
landscape can be understood by the identification of cultural features.

Identifying Cultural Features of a topographic map

The  way  how  man  has  utilized  the  land  and  features  formed  on  it  can  be 
identified as cultural features. In the key of the topographic maps these cultural features 
have been indicated mainly under the headings of boundaries, tourist information, 
roads and paths, and railway lines. Some cultural features have been mainly included 
under the headings of drainage, natural vegetation and general features.

The way how the distribution of human activities that is formed on the physical 
landscape is represented by using different symbols and colors, can be understood by 
reading the map.

Activity

Neatly draw the symbols that represent the cultural features under relevant main 
headings after studying the conventional signs of a 1:50 000 topographic maps.

Types of Boundaries 

All  the  administrative  boundaries  on  1:  50  000  topographic  maps  are 
shown in red using different symbols. Though the boundaries of sanctuaries and 
forest  reserves  are  included      among  them  features  that  belong  to  the  physical 
environment can be found in sanctuaries.  It must be understood that though these 
boundaries are seen on the maps , they are invisible cultural features on the land.  
When you observe a map it will be clear to you  that  physical features like rivers, 
mountain ranges  are used  as the boundaries that divide the administrative units.

Tourist information

Information like the rest house, the hotel, historical places necessary for the 
tourists, are presented by symbols on the topographic maps.  It is important to be well 
aware of these symbols and colors which are used to represent each feature when 
reading maps.

Roads

The symbols that represent roads on topographic maps are given under the 
headings  of  roads  and  paths  and  railway  lines.  Though  the  recently  constructed 
express ways have not been shown on the maps, they will be included on the maps 
printed in future.

Water Supply

The symbols that represent tanks and irrigation that show the water supply 
in a certain region come under the cultural features. These features are shown by the 
symbols under drainage.

Cultivated lands

Cultivated lands that come under cultural features are shown under vegetations 
on  topographical  maps.  The  symbols  which  are  used  to  identify  the  chief  crops 
cultivated  like paddy, tea, rubber, coconut and other crops  as well as home gardens 
are included  here.  When cultivated lands are represented, paddy lands are shown in 
green, home gardens in yellow, green symbols on a yellow background are used for 
other crops. It is very important to have a correct identification of all crop cultivations 
by symbols, when the landscape of the mapped area is interpreted.

Special Buildings

Special buildings come under the "other features" category. Permanent buildings 
are shown using a small black square and special buildings are shown using a square a 
bit larger than that. The name of the special building is mentioned on the map. Significant 
public buildings are shown using symbols and they can be identified as public service 
centres and religious buildings. The built up areas marked in pink on urban areas are 
significant among the cultural features. 

Different  symbols  used  to  depict  cultural  features  are  not  drawn  to  a  scale. 
Therefore, they are to be considered only as symbols used  to identify different cultural 
features.

Interpreting Maps

Both  the  physical  landscape  created  by  nature  itself  and  the  cultural 
landscape that has been built on it by man over a longer period, are represented 
by the 1: 50 000 topographic maps. Hence by reading a map it becomes clear   
that there is an important relationship between the physical features and cultural 
features of the mapped area.  The establishment of the road pattern, agricultural 
land use pattern, irrigation system and the settlement pattern compatible with 
the relief pattern of a certain area can be shown as examples.

When topographic maps are observed a road pattern that spread   straight 
in the flat areas and a road pattern that runs through passes with bends in hilly 
areas can be identified.  The roads in hilly areas are mostly built along the river 
valleys. 

When  the  agricultural  land  use  of  the  mapped  area  is  considered,  it 
becomes  clear  that  crops  are  grown  to  match  the  land. Wide  paddy  lands  in 
low plain areas  and associated with river valleys , narrow long paddy lands  in 
river valleys in hilly areas , tea cultivation in hilly regions  rubber cultivation 
in  gentle slope regions , coconut cultivation in  coastal and suburb regions and 
Chena cultivation  close to the scrub forests in  the districts of the Dry Zones  
can be cited as example. 

When  the  water  supply  of  a  certain  region  is  considered,  the  features 
like construction of large irrigation systems associated with the river valleys, 
construction  of  tanks  blocking  the  rivers  that  flow  through  the  narrow  gaps 
by building dams joining the spurs of the ridges located on  either side of the 
rivers and cultivation of the lands located below the dam can be identified as 
the  cultural features formed compatible to the relief of the land.

When maps are observed it is clear that the relief of any area influences 

the formation of the human settlement pattern .  While the settlements spread 

over  a  wide  area  in  plains,  scattered  small  settlements  can  be  found  located 

in valleys in hilly areas.  When interpreting maps, attention must be focused 

on both settlement pattern and also  the type of settlement . According to the 

distribution  of  settlements  linear,  cluster  and  a  scattered  settlement  patterns 

can be identified.  A linear settlement pattern along the roads and narrow land 

belts and cluster settlement patterns at road junctions can be seen. 

According  to  the  life  pattern  of  the  people  different  settlements  like 

tank  settlements,  fishing  settlements,  estate  settlements  can  be  identified.   

Settlements are again divided as rural and urban settlements.  While hospitals, 

main  post  offices,  main  banks,  courts,  police  stations  are  located  in  a  town, 

several  roads  also  get  connected  there.    Railway  stations  too  are  located  at 

some places. In topographic maps, such places are shown in pink as built up 

areas.  Rural settlements can be identified by sub post offices, other roads, cart 

tracks, foot paths etc. 

Physical features are mostly utilized in delimitation of the administrative 

borders.  It  becomes  clear  when  topographic  maps  are  observed  that  the 

administrative borders have been set along mountain ranges and rivers.

An  idea  about  the  social  identity  in  the  human  community  can  be  obtained 

when  interpreting  maps.    Presence  of  different  types  of  religious  centres 

within a region itself, diversity of religions as well as type of communities can 

be identified. 

     Activity

With  the  teacher’s  advice,  present  the  human  and  physical  landscape  of 
your own region or where your school is located using conventional signs, 
colors and symbols. Prepare a key to the conventional signs.  Any land area 
can be selected according to your preference.

1010 Using Graphs to Represent Data 

Like  in  studying  any  other  subject,  in  studying  geography  too  statistical 
tables are used a great deal to collect necessary data and information. The graph 
can be considered as a medium that is used to understand the information present in 
statistical tables easily and quickly.  

The basic objective of this chapter is to make one understand about the simple 
line graph, multiple bar graph,  and the simple  divided circles  which are 
used to represent data.

When  a  statistical  table  is  presented  in  a  graph,  it  is  important  to  have  a 
good understanding about the nature of the data and the most suitable type of graph 
necessary to represent it. 

Simple Line Graph

Presentation of data in a statistical table by lines is done in a line graph. 
This  line  graph  is  much  used  to  represent  the  variables  that  change  with  time. 
The temperature, atmospheric pressure, the growth of the population and the state 
revenue  are  some  examples  of  the  variables  that  are  represented  by  simple  line 
graphs. Simple line graphs are mostly used because of the ease in drawing them and 
also because the trends could be instantly understood.

 The factors that should be considered when graph is drawn

 ² Selection of a suitable scale according to the statistical table given.
 ²

 Marking time on the horizontal axis and the relevant variables on the vertical 
axis.
 Setting the vertical scale taking the minimum of the relevant statistical table 
as zero and the round number next to the highest value of the statistics as the 
maximum. 

 ²

 ² Marking  “0”  at  the  foot  of  the  vertical  axis  and  “100”  at  the  top  when 

percentage values are represented. 

 ² Writing a suitable heading according to the statistics in the table.

 ² Using a suitable color for the line that a single variable is represented.

Multiple Bar Graphs 

  Presentation of a statistical table using bars is done by a bar graph.  These 
bars can be drawn either horizontally or vertically. Multiple bar graphs are used 
when the data of several variables   are presented. A multiple bar graph is more 
suitable  for  the  representation  of  the  data  like  the  annual  production  of  several 
goods and number of different vehicles registered over several years etc.  Ability 
to  identify  the  numerical  value  of  a  variable  easily,  ability  to  compare  several 
variables of a year and the ability to study the periodical trends of those variables 
comparatively are the benefits of this method of graph.

When  multiple  bar  graphs  are  drawn,  the  following  factors  should  be 

considered. 

 ² Determining the vertical scale   according to the maximum and minimum 

values of the statistical table.

 ² Marking the time on horizontal axis and the amount on vertical axis.
 ² Setting starting point of the vertical axis  as zero (0).
 ² Drawing the bars of relevant years joining to each other with equal width.
 ² Showing by separating the group of bars of a year from the bars of other year.
 ² Showing  the  bars  of  the  same  variable  relating  to  a  particular  year  by  the 

same color or design.

 ² Showing used colors or designs by a key.

      Activities

1.  Name the variables represented in the graph.

2.  What is the development of that variable during 2006- 2011 in rupees billions.

       Assignment

 ² Prepare a multiple bar graph based on a statistical table found in the Central 

Bank Annual Report or on any other statistical table.
 State the temporal variations of the each of the variable.  

 ²

 Divided Circles

The circle graph that is used to represent the composition of the variables 
included in a certain statistical table is known as a divided circle graph. In this 
graph,  total  value  of  all  the  variables  is  considered  360◦  and  according  to  the 
value of each variable, 360◦ is divided into sub parts.  The divided circle graph is 
most suitable to represent data like   composition of ethnic groups of a country, 
religious composition, and export and import composition.

The  composition  of  variables  as  well  as  their  proportion  could  be 

understood comparatively in a divided circle graph.

When  drawing  a  divided  circle  graph  the  following  steps  should    be 

considered.

 ² Drawing a circle using a suitable radius for the graph.
 ² Deciding the value of angle of the each variable considering the value of the 

total variables of 360◦.

 ² Finding the value of each variable according to the percentage value when 
composition is given in percentage considering 360◦ value of the circle as 
100.

 ² Marking the angular values clockwise according to the size from the base line 
that is drawn from the centre of the circle until it meets the circumference 
towards North.

 ² Placing at the end, If there is a variable marked as "others". 

 ² Completing the drawing   of the graph by setting the key with the colors used, 

to show the composition, scale, heading and the source of data.

Real Numbers

By studying this lesson will be able to
  ²  to investigate number sets
  ²  workout basic mathematical operations regarding surds.

It is believed that the concept of numbers originated among the human race about 
30 000 years ago. This concept which originated and developed independently in 
various  civilizations,  evolved  globally  and  has  now  become  a  universal  field  of 
study named mathematics.

It can be assumed that numbers were initially used in early civilizations for simple 
purposes such as counting and accounting. There is no doubt that the first numerical 
concepts that were developed were “one” and “two”.  Later the concepts of three, 
four etc., must have been developed. Then man would have realized that he could 
name  any  amount  that  he  wished  in  this  manner.  Different  civilizations  used 
different symbols to name numbers.

It is accepted based on historical evidence, that the numerals 1, 2, 3 etc., which we 
now use, originated in India.  The honour of being the first to use the concept of zero 
as a number as well as being the first to introduce the positional decimal number 
system also goes to India. This number system is now defined as the Hindu-Arabic 
number system and the modern belief is that it was first taken to the Middle-East 
and then to Europe by traders. This system is the standard number system which is 
accepted and used worldwide now.

The manipulation of numbers using the basic mathematical operations (addition, 
subtraction, multiplication and division) can be considered as a great revolution in 
the history of mankind in relation to the use of numbers.  In this age of technology it 
is unimaginable to think of the existence of man without numbers and the operations 
performed on them.

Although the numbers 1, 2, 3 etc., can be considered as the first numbers that were 
used to fulfill certain needs of man, later the number zero, fractional numbers and 
negative numbers were also included in the number system. During the period when 
mathematics  was  developing  as  a  separate  field,  the  attention  of  mathematicians 
was directed towards various other types of numbers (sets) too. In this lesson we 
hope to study about such sets of numbers, their notations and properties.

For free distribution

For free distributionThe Set of Integers ( )

It is natural that we identify initially the numbers 1, 2, 3, … which we first learnt 
about  as  children. These  numbers  are  defined  as  counting  numbers  and  the  set 
which consists of all these numbers is written using set notation as follows.

{1, 2, 3, …}

The reason for this set of numbers to be called the counting numbers is very clear.  
However its mathematical usage in modern times is limited.  The name used most 
often now for this set is “the set of positive integers”. This set is denoted by 

+.

Thus,   + = {1, 2, 3, ...}.

That is, the numbers 1, 2, 3, … are called positive integers.

The numbers defined as negative integers are  – 1,  – 2,  – 3, etc. Although there is 
no commonly used symbol to denote this set, some mathematicians, based on the 
needs of their field of study, use the symbol 

–.

The  positive  integers,  zero  and  the  negative  integers  together  form  the  set  of 
. Accordingly,
integers. This set is denoted by 

 =  { ..., – 3, – 2, – 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}

or equivalently,

 =  {0, ±1, ±2, ±3, ...}.

The Set of Natural Numbers  ()

Let us consider again the set of numbers 1, 2, 3,... This set is also defined as the set 
'
of natural numbers and is denoted by 


That is, 



 = {1, 2, ...}.

Note:  There  is  no  consensus  among  mathematicians  regarding  which  numbers 
should  be  considered  as  natural  numbers. The  suitability  of  calling  the  numbers 
1, 2,3, … natural numbers is clear. However some of the mathematicians (especially 
specialists in set theory), have considered 0 as a natural number in their books.

For free distribution   
 
 
                     
 
 
 
One reason may be because at that time there was no accepted name nor accepted 
symbol for the set consisting of 0 and the positive integers.However most books on 
number theory consider the set of natural numbers to be the set {1, 2, 3,...}.Almost 
all  authors  of  mathematics  books  now  mention  at  the  beginning  of  their  books 
which set of numbers they consider as the natural numbers.

The set of Rational Numbers ( )

1

We have come across earlier that, like the integers, fractions too can be considered 
as  numbers,  and  that  operations  such  as  addition  and  multiplication  can  be 
performed on them too. Every integer can be written as a fraction. (For example, 
we can write 2 = 
). Further, a fraction can be written in different forms, all having 
the same numerical value. (For example, 1
 = 
). We have also come across 
2
2
, etc.&' Although we usually think that the numerator 
negative fractions ^– 
5
and  denominator  of  a  fraction  should  consist  of  integers,  this  is  actually  not  the 
case. For example,  3
 is also a fraction. However, fractions with integers in both 
2
the  numerator  and  the  denominator  (apart  from  0  in  the  denominator),  have  an 
important  place  in  mathematics.  They  are  called  rational  numbers.  The  set  of 
rational numbers is denoted by 
 . Accordingly, the set of rational numbers can be 
defined using the set builder notation as follows.

 =

  ={ 

a
b  : a, b   

 and b ≠ 0 }.

There are other ways too of defining the set of rational numbers. One other way is 
as follows.  

 ={ 

a
b  : a   

 , b   

+ }.

Both these definitions are equivalent. Since the denominator of a rational number 
cannot  be  0  and  since  all  the  negative  rational  numbers  can  be  obtained  by 
considering the fractions with the negative integers in the numerator and positive 
integers in the denominator.

The Set of Irrational Numbers  

It is appropriate to define the irrational numbers now. Do you recall how you learnt 
about numbers in previous grades by drawing a number line?  Let us reconsider 
this now.

Let  us  consider  a  straight  line  which  can  be  lengthened  as  required  in  either 
direction. Let us name a point we like on that line as the origin 0. Let us assume 
that we have marked all the numbers 1, 2, 3, etc., on one side of 0 (usually the right  
hand side) and all the numbers – 1, – 2, – 3 etc., on the opposite side, keeping equal 
gaps between the numbers.  That is, let us assume that the points corresponding to 
all the integers have been marked on this number line. Let us also assume that the 
points corresponding to all the rational numbers too have been marked on this line. 

The figure below shows several such points that have been marked.

Accordingly,  all  the  rational  numbers  (including  the  integers)  are  now  assumed 
to have been marked on this line. Now, do you think that corresponding to each 
point on the line, a number has been marked? If asked differently, do you think that 
the distance from 0 to each point on the line can be written as a rational number? 
In  truth,  there  are  several  points  remaining  on  the  number  line  which  have  not 
been marked.  That is, there are points remaining on this number line that cannot 
be represented by a rational number. It is clear that the points that are remaining 
are those which correspond to the numbers which cannot be written in the form                       
 a
, where a and b are integers. The numbers which correspond to the remaining 
b
points are defined as irrational numbers.

,  the  complement  of  the  set   

There is no specific symbol to denote the set of irrational numbers and it is usually 
. The  numbers    2"  3"  5  can  be 
denoted  by 
given as examples of irrational numbers. In fact, the square root of any positive 
integer  which  is  not  a  perfect  square  is  an  irrational  number. Apart  from  these, 
mathematicians have proved that π, which is the ratio of the circumference of any 
circle to its diameter, is also an irrational number. We take the value of π to be 22
7
as an approximate value, for the convenience of performing calculations.

The Set of Real Numbers  ( )

According  to  the  above  discussion,  all  the  numbers  on  a  number  line  can  be 
represented  by  rational  numbers  or  irrational  numbers.  We  call  all  the  rational 
numbers together with all the irrational numbers, that is, all the numbers that can be 
represented on a number line, the real numbers. The set of real numbers is denoted 
by 

.

The Decimal Representation of a Number

Any real number can be represented as a decimal number. Initially, let us consider 
the decimal representation of several rational numbers.

1. The decimal representation of a rational number

4 = 4.000 ...

 1
2  = 0.5 = 0.5000 ...

= 2.131313...

= 5.11333...

 = 5.285714285714285714 ...

A  common  property  of  these  decimal  representations  is  that  starting  at  a  certain 
point to the right of the decimal point (or from the beginning), one set of numerals 
(or one numeral) is recurring. Recurring means that it keeps repeating itself.
For example, in the decimal representation of  1
, the numeral 0 recurs starting from 
2
the second decimal place. The numeral 0 recurs from the first decimal place in the 

decimal representation of 4, the pair of numerals 13 recurs from the beginning in 
the decimal representation of 211
99

and the  group of numerals 285714 recurs from 

 37
7 . This property, that is, a group 
the beginning in the decimal representation of  
of numerals recurring continuously, is a property common to all rational numbers.  
If  the  portion  that  recurs  is  just  0,  such  a  decimal  representation  is  defined  as  a 
finite decimal (or terminating decimal). The decimals of which the portion that 

5

For free distribution 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recurs is not zero, are called recurring decimals. Accordingly, 
above example are finite decimals while the rest are recurring decimals.

in the 

The above discussion leads to the following statement.

Every  rational  number  can  be  written  as  a  finite  decimal  or  a  recurring 
decimal.
Let  us  now  learn  a  marvelous  result  regarding  rational  numbers.  Suppose  the  
rational number  a
b
b have no common factors.  Then the denominator (that is, b) has only powers of 
2  or  5  (or  both)  as  its  factors. A  rational  number  which  has  a  recurring  decimal 
representation must have a prime factor other than 2 and 5 in its denominator.

has a finite decimal representation. Let us assume that a and 

Recurring decimals are written in a concise form, by placing a dot above a numeral 
or numerals as shown in the following examples to indicate that they are recurring.

2. The decimal representation of an irrational number
Finally, let us consider the decimal representation of an irrational number. In the 
decimal representation of an irrational number, no group of numerals recurs. For 
example, when the decimal representation of  2 is written down up to 60 decimal 
places, we obtain the following: 

1.414213562373095048801688724209698078569671875376948073176679

π, which is a number we come across often is also an irrational number. When the 
value of π is calculated up to 60 decimal places we obtain the following:

3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944

The following statements can be made regarding irrational numbers.

There is no group of recurring numerals in the decimal representation of an 
irrational  number.  If  the  decimal  representation  of  a  number  is  not  finite,  it  is 
called  an  infinite  decimal.  Accordingly  rational  numbers  which  are  recurring 
decimals and irrational numbers have infinite decimal representations.

Note:  When  describing  the  decimal  representation  of  irrational  numbers,  one 
frequent  error  that  is  made  is  stating  that  “there  is  no  pattern  in  the  decimal 
representation of an irrational number”. The issue here is that the word “pattern” is 
not well defined in mathematics. For example, the following decimal number has 
a very clear pattern.

0.101001000100001000001...

However, this is an irrational number, Observe that there is no group of recurring 
numbers.

All the sets of numbers that have been studied so far can be represented in a Venn 
diagram as follows, with the set of real numbers as the universal set, and the other 
sets as its subsets. A few numbers belonging to each subset have been included to 
make it easier for you to understand the relationship between the sets.

1.2 Surds

˜

There is no doubt that you recall how  numerical (and algebraic) expressions are 
 ˜ which is defined as the radical sign. For example, 
written using the symbol 
4  is defined as the positive square root of 4 and it represents the positive number 
which when squared is equal to 4; that is 2. The positive square root is referred to 
as square root too. If a certain positive integer x is such that its square root  x   is 
also a positive integer, then x is defined as a perfect square.  Accordingly, 4  is a 
perfect square. Since  4  is equal to 2. However,  2  is not the square root of a 
perfect square. We observed earlier that  2   is approximately equal to 1.414. We 
also learnt earlier in this lesson that  2  is an irrational number. A numerical term 
 of which the value is not a rational number is defined as 
involving the symbol 
a surd.
  ˜  is used not only to denote the square roots of numbers, 
The radical sign —
but also other roots. For example,  23
  denotes the positive number which when 
raised to the power 3 is equal to 2. This is called the cube root of 2. This is also an 
irrational number.  Its value is approximately 1.2599. (You can verify this by finding 
the value of 1.25993).  We can define the fourth root of 2 and the fifth root of 2 etc., 
in a similar manner. Such definitions can be made for other positive numbers as 
well; for example,  53
. Such expressions are also surds. However, in 
this lesson we will only consider surds which are square roots of positive integers.

6
 and   8.24

The square root of a positive integer which is not a perfect square is neither a finite 
decimal nor a recurring decimal. Observe that surds are therefore always irrational 
numbers.

Here our focus is on simplifying expressions which involve surds. There are many 
reasons  why  such  simplifications  are  important.  One  reason  is  that  it  facilitates 
1 ,  if  we 
calculations.  For  example,  when  it  is  necessary  to  find  the  value  of 
2
take  2  to be approximately equal to 1.414, we would need to find the value of         
. This division is fairly long. However, by simplifying this in the following 

 ^Multiplying the numerator and denominator by  2 &

manner, calculations are made easier.

Another reason for simplifying surds is to minimize errors during calculations.

For example, let us find the value of   20
2
value for  20  , and 2.2 as an approximate value for  5 . Then

–  5  . Let us use 4.5 as an approximate

– 2.2

4.5

2.25 – 2.2

0.05 

However, the actual value of this expression is 0. One reason for getting a different 
answer  is  because  we  used  approximate  values  for  20  and  5 .  However,  by 
simplifying the above expression in a different way, we can get the correct value 
which is 0. 

Surds appear in various form.
A special feature of a surd of the form  20  is that the whole number is under the 
radical sign. Such surds are defined as entire surds.  6  15  means 6 ×  15. This 
is a product of a surd and a rational number (not equal to 1).  This is not an entire 
surd.
A surd is in its simplest form when it is in the form a  b ; where a is a rational 
number and b has no factors which are perfect squares. For example 6  15 is in its 
simplest form but 5  12 is not, since 4 which is a perfect square is a factor of 12.

Now let us consider how to simplify expressions that contain surds of various forms.

Example 1

Simplify 3  5  +  6  5 .

This can be simplified by considering  5   to be an unknown term.

  3  5  +  6  5 = 9  5 .
This simplification is similar to the simplification 3x + 6x = 9x. 

Observe  that  the  expression  obtained  above  in  surd  form  cannot  be  simplified 
further. Keep in mind that simplifying further by using an approximate value for 

5  is not what is meant by simplifying surds.

You should also keep in mind the important fact that an expression of the form 
3  2  + 8  3  cannot be simplified further.

Now let us through examples, consider how expressions with surds are simplified 
by applying the properties of indices.

Next let us consider how multiplication and division are performed on surds.

Example 4  
Simplify:  5  3     4  2  .

Let us multiply the rational and irrational parts separately.

5  3     4  2   =  5     4      3     2  

=  20    3   2
=  20  6  

Example 5  

Simplify: 3  20  ..2  5 .

The surd 3  20  can be written as  3  4   5 . Simplifying further, it can be written 
as 3   2  5   =  6  5  

...  3  20  ..2  5  =  3

for such expressions are 
in the denominator. 

3  and

Now let us consider how such an expression can be converted into an expression 
with an integer (or a rational number) in the denominator.

Example 6  
Express 

3  as a fraction with an integer in the denominator.

The method used here is, to multiply both the numerator and the denominator of 
3     by  2

Now let us consider how an expression involving surds is simplified.

Example 8  
Example 8  
Simplify  4  63 – 5  7  –  8  28 .
Simplify  4  63 – 5  7  –  8  28 .
4  63 = 4    9   7    = 4   3   7
4  63 = 4    9   7    = 4   3   7

8  28 = 8    4   7   = 8   2   7   
8  28 = 8    4   7   = 8   2   7   

= 12  7
= 12  7

= 16  7  
= 16  7  

Therefore  4  63 – 5   7  – 8  28 = 12  7  –  5  7  – 16  7  
Therefore  4  63 – 5   7  – 8  28 = 12  7  –  5  7  – 16  7  

     = – 9  7  
     = – 9

2.1 Fractional Indices of a Power

Square root of 4 can be written either using the radical symbol (square root symbol) 
as  4√
  or using powers as 4
Therefore, it is clear that  4√

=    4

Let us consider another example, similar to the above. As 2 = 21,

 2   2   2 = 21   21   21 
   = 23
                          = 8

Third power of 2 is 8' Thus, the cube root of 8 is 2. This can be denoted symbolically 
as"  

3

  8√

=  2

 or  8

1
3   =  2.

Therefore it is clear that   8√
Futhermore, if  a  is a positive real number, then  

=  8

          a√  = a
         3 a√

        4 a√
  = a
Thus, the general relationship between the radical symbol and the exponent (index)

of a power can be expressed as follows.

The  following  examples  demonstrate  how  the  above  relationship  can  be  used  to

2.2 Solving Equations with Indices

2x = 23 is an equation. Because the bases of the powers on either side of the equal 
sign are equal, the exponents must be equal. Thus, from 2x = 23 , we can conclude 
that x = 3'
Similarly, on either side of the equation x5 = 25 are powers with equal exponents. 

Because the indices are equal, the bases are also equal.  Therefore, from  x5 = 25 
we can conclude that x = 2' If x2 = 32 then the indices are equal but in this case, 
both + 3 and − 3 are solutions. The reason for two solutions arising is because the 
exponent — 2 ˜ is an even number.  In this lesson, we will only consider powers with

a positive base. Thus, in expressions of the form xm ,  x > 0'
There is a special property of powers of 1. All powers of 1 are equal to 1. That is, 
for any m, 1m = 1'

Let us summarise the above observations.   

For x > 0, y > 0, y ≠ 1 and x ≠ 1,

if  x ≠ 0 xm = xn,  then  m = n'
if m ≠ 0 and xm = ym,  then x = y'

Let us use these rules to solve equations with indices.

(iii) 3   92x − 1 = 27

(ii) x3 = 343

	 ∴	x = 3                        ∴ x = 7

                 3 1 + 4x − 2  = 3−3x
  ∴  1 + 4x − 2  =  −3x
             4x + 3x = 2 − 1

2.3  Laws of logarithms

We know that, using the laws of logarithms, we can write
log2 (16     32) = log216 + log232 and log2 (32  .. 16) = log232 – log216. These laws, 
in general, can be written as follows.  

  loga (mn) = loga m + loga n
 loga  m
n

 = loga m – loga n 

Let us learn another law of a similar type. 

Consider log51254 as an example.
log51254 = log5 (125 

 125   125   125)
= log5125 + log5125 + log5125 + log5125
= 4 log5125

Similarly, 

log10105 = 5 log1010 and

log352 = 2 log35 

This observation can be written, in general, as the following logarithmic law'

loga mr = r logam

This law is even valid for expressions with fractional indices. Given below are a 
few examples, where this law is applied to powers with fractional indices.

Indices and Logarithms II

 By studying this lesson you will be able to 

² use the table of logarithms to simplify expressions involving products and quotients 

of powers and roots of numbers between 0 and 1. 

²  identify the two keys 

  on a scientific calculater, and simplify 
expressions  involving  decimal  numbers,  powers  and  roots  using  a  scientific 
calculator. 

  and  √

Logarithms

103  =  1000  can  be  written  using  logarithms  as   log10 1000  =  3. As  a  convention 
we  write  "lg"  instead  of  "log10 ".  Now  we  can  express  the  above  expression  as                                           
lg 1000 = 3. It is important to mention the base if it is other than 10'
For example"
    log5 25 = 2  because 52 = 25, 
      lg 1 = 0  because 100 = 1" and
    lg 10 = 1  because 101 = 10'

The logarithm of any positive number can be found using the  table of logarithms. 
Do the following exercise to refresh the memory on using logarithms to simplify 
expressions involving multiplications and divisions of numbers.

3.1 Logarithms of decimal numbers less than one

Let us now consider how to use the table of logarithms to obtain the logarithms 
of  numbers  between  0  and  1,  by  paying  close  attention  to  how  we  obtained  the 
logarithms of numbers greater than 1. For this purpose, carefully investigate the 
following table.

According  to  the  above  table,  the  characteristic  of  the  logarithm  of  numbers 
inbetween  0  and  1,  coming  after  5.432  in  the  first  column,  are  negative'  Even 
though the characteristic is negative, the mantissa of the logarithm, which is found 
using the table, is a positive number. The symbol —−˜ is used above the whole part 
to indicate that only the characteristic is negative. It is read as "bar". 
For example,  2  −.3725 is read as "bar two point three, seven, two, five"' Moreover, 
what is represented by  2  −.3725  is − 2 + 0.3725'

The characteristic of the logarithm of a number between 0 and 1 is negative. The 
characteristic of the logarithm of such a number can be obtained either by writing 
it in scientific notation or by counting the number of zeros after the decimal point. 

The characteristic of the logarithm can be obtained by adding one to the number 
of zeros after the decimal point (and before the next non-zero digit) and taking its 
negative value. Observe it in the above table too.

 Example

0.004302  Number of zeros after the decimal point and before the next
 non-zero digit is 2. Therefore characteristic of the logarithm 
is 3−

29

For free distribution 
0.04302  Number  of  zeros  after  the  decimal  point  is  1;  thus  the 

characteristic of the logarithm is 2−  
Number  of  zeros  after  the  decimal  point  is  0;  thus  the 
characteristic of the logarithm is  1−

 0.4302 

Therefore, lg 0.004302 = 3− .6337' 
When written using indices, it is; 
0.004302 = 103− .6337' This can also be written as" 0.004302 = 10 −3    100.6337'
Do  the  following  exercise  to  practice  taking  logarithms  of  numbers  between                
0 and 1.

3.2 Number corresponding to a logarithm (antilog)

Let us recall how the antilog of a number greater than 1 is obtained. 

antilog 2.7421 = 5.522   102  

  = 552.2 

When a number is written in scientific form, the index of the power of 10 is the 
characteristic of the logarithm of that number. The characteristic of the logarithm 
indicates  the  number  of  places  that  the  decimal  point  needs  to  be  shifted  when 
taking the antilog.   

Thus, we obtained 552.2 by shifting the decimal point of 5.522 two places to the 
right. However, when the characteristic is negative the decimal point is shifted to 
the left side.

3.3  Addition  and  subtraction  of  logarithms  with  negative 

characteristics

(a) Addition

The mantissa of a logarithm is obtained from the table of logarithms and is always 
positive.  But  we  now  know  that,  the  characteristic  can  be  positive,  negative  or 
zero.  In  2−.  5143,  the  mantissa,  .5143,  is  positive  and  the  characteristic,  2−,  is 
negative' When adding or subtracting such numbers, it is important to simplify the 
characteristic and the mantissa separately. 

Example 1

(i)  2−. 5143 + 1−. 2375 
(i) 2−. 5143  +  1−. 2375  

(ii)   3−. 9211 + 2 . 3142  

(iii)   3−. 8753 + 1−. 3475

= − 2 + 0.5143 + ( − 1 ) + 0.2375
= (− 2 − 1) + (0.5143 + 0.2375)
= − 3 + 0.7518
= 3−. 7518

(ii)   3−. 9211 + 2 . 3142  

(iii)  3− . 8753 + 1.3475  

= − 3 + 0.9211 + 2 + 0.3142
= (− 3 + 2) + (0.9211 + 0.3142)  
= − 1 + 1.2353 
= − 1 + 1 + 0.2353
= 0.2353  

= − 3 + 0.8753 + 1 + 0.3475
= (− 3 + 1) + (0.8753 + 0.3475)
= − 2 + 1.2228
= − 2 + 1 + 0.2228
=  1−. 2228

(b) Subtraction

As in addition, logarithms should be subtracted from right to left, remembering that 
the mantissa is positive. 

Example 2  
Simplify and express the answer in log form.
(i)  2−. 5143 − 1.3143 = − 2 + 0.5143 − (1 + 0.3143)                     

= − 2 + 0.5143 − 1 − 0.3143
= − 2 − 1 + 0.5143 − 0.3143
= − 3 + 0 . 2000
=  3−. 2000

(ii)  2. 5143 − 1−. 9143 = 2 + 0.5143 − (− 1 + 0.9143)               

= 2 + 0.5143 + 1 − 0.9143
= 3 − 0.4000
= 2.6000

(iii) 0.2143 − 1−. 8143 = 0.2143 − (− 1 + 0.8143)                       

= 0.2143 + 1 − 0.8143
= 1 − 0.6000
= 0.4 

(iv)  2−. 5143 − 1−. 9143 = − 2 + 0.5143 − (− 1 + 0.9143)            

= − 2 + 0.5143 + 1 − 0.9143
=  − 2 + 1 + 0.5143 − 0.9143
= −1 − 0.4000

In the above example, the decimal part is negative. Because we need the decimal 
part of a logarithm to be positive, we will use a trick as follows to make it positive.  

 − 1 −  0.4 = − 1 − 1 +  1 − 0.4  (Because − 1 + 1 = 0, we have not changed the value')                        

= − 2 + 0.6
=   2− . 6

Actually what we have done is add − 1 to the characteristic and + 1 to the mantissa.

Note:  We  could  have  avoided  getting  a  negative  decimal  part  by  doing  the 
simplification as follows. 

 − 2 + 0.5143 + 1 − 0.9143 =  − 2 + 1.5143 − 0.9143 = − 2 + 0.6 =  2− . 6

Two methods of simplifying are shown below.

  Method 2:

Method 1: 

a. 43.85 × 0.7532

Take P = 43.85 × 0.7532   

Then lg P = lg (43.85 × 0.7532)

 b.  0.0034 × 0.8752

        Take P = 0.0034 × 0.8752.

 Then,      

  lg P = lg (0.0034  × 0.8752)

3.5 Multiplication and division of a logarithm of a number by a 

whole number 

We know that the characteristic of a number greater than one is positive. Multiplying 
or dividing such a logarithm by a  number can be done in the usual way.

We know that the characteristic of the logarithm of a number between 0 and 1 is 
negative.  3−. 8247 is such a logarithm. When multiplying or dividing a logarithm 
with a negative characteristic by a number, we simplify the characteristic and the 
mantissa separately.

Division of a logarithm by a whole number

Let  us  now  consider  how  to  divide  a  logarithm  by  a  whole  number.  When  the 
characteristic of a logarithm is negative the characteristic and the mantissa carry 
negative and positive values respectively. Therefore, it is important to divide the 
positive part and the negative part separately. Let us now consider some examples 
of this type.

3.8 Applications of logarithms

The table of logarithms can be used to do computations efficiently in many problems 
that involve products and divisions of numbers. Such an example is given below. 

Example 1

The volume V, of a sphere of radius r is given by" V =  4
πr3 ' By taking π = 3.142 
3
and given that r = 0.64 cm" use the table of logarithms to find the volume of the 
sphere to the nearest first decimal place.

         lg V  =   lg  

πr3

3  3.142   0.643 
  =   lg 4 + lg 3.142 + 3 lg 0.64 – lg 3  
  =  0.6021 + 0.4972 + 3     1−.8062 – 0.4771  
   =   0.6021 + 0.4972 +  1−.4186 – 0.4771

                 =  0.5179 – 0.4771

  =  0.0408
      ∴   V  =  antilog 0.0408
  =  1.098    
  ≈  1.1   (to the nearest first decimal place) 

  ∴ The volume of the sphere is 1.1 cm3.

3.9 Using a calculator

Logarithms have been used for a long time to do complex numerical computations.   
However, its use has now been replaced to a great extent by calculators. Computations 
that can be done using an ordinary calculator is limited. For complex computations 
one needs to use a scientific calculator. The keyboard of a scientific calculator is 
much more complex than that of an ordinary calculator. 

Evaluating powers using a calculator:

5213 can be computed by entering 521    521    521 into an ordinary calculator.  
However, this can be computed easily using a scientific calculator, by either using 
the key indicating xn or by

Surface area of solids

By studying this lesson you will be able to"

² find the surface area of a right pyramid with a square base,
² find the surface area of a right circular cone, and
² find the surface area of a sphere. 

Pyramid

Carefully  observe  the  solid  objects  in  the  above  figure.  Note  that  their  faces  are 
polygons. Of these faces, the horizontal face at the bottom is called the base. All the 
faces, except the base are of triangular shape. The common point of these triangular 
faces is called the "apex". A solid object with these properties is called a "pyramid". 
Note that the bases of the Pyramids shown above are respectively, the shape of a 
quadrilateral, a pentagon and a hexagon.

Right pyramid with a square base

Slant 
edge

Triangular face

Perpendicular 
height

The  base  of  the  pyramid  in  the  figure  is  a 
square. All the remaining faces are triangular 
in  shape.  If  the  line  segment  connecting  the 
apex and the midpoint of the square base (that 
is the intersection point of the two diagonals) 
is  perpendicular  to  the  base,  then  such  a 
pyramid  is  called  a  "square  based  right 
pyramid".  The  length  of  the  line  segment 
connecting  the  apex  and  the  midpoint  of  the 
base  is  called  the  perpendicular  height  (or 
simply the height) of the pyramid. The edges of the triangular faces which are not 
common to the base are called slant edges. In this lesson, we will only consider 
finding the surface area of square  based right pyramids.

Note:  A  tetrahedron  can  also  be  considered  as  a  pyramid.  All  the  faces  of  a 
tetrahedron are triangular in shape. Any one of the faces can be taken as the base.
The concept of —right pyramid˜ can be defined even when the base is not a square. 
For  example,  we  can  define  a  right  pyramid  when  the  base  of  a  pyramid  is  a 
regular polygon, as follows. First note that all the axes of symmetry of a regular 
polygon pass through a common point, which is called the centroid of the regular 
polygon. A pyramid, having a base which is a regular polygon, is called a right 
pyramid, if the line segment connecting the apex and the centroid of the base is 
perpendicular to the base. 
If you study mathematics further, you will learn how to define the centroid, even 
when the base is not a regular polygon. 

An important property of a square based right pyramid is that all its triangular faces 
are congruent to each other. Therefore, all the triangular faces have the same area. 
Moreover, note that each triangular face is an isosceles or an equilateral triangle, 
with one side a side of the square base and the other two sides equal in length. 

4.1 Surface area of a square based right pyramid

To find the total surface area of a square based right pyramid we need to add the 
areas of the base and the four triangular faces.
Suppose the length of a side of the square base is —a˜ and  the perpendicular height 
of a triangular face is "l".

Let us now consider some solved examples on the surface area of a square based 
right pyramid.

height of a triangular face is 15 cm.  Find the total surface area of the pyramid.

Total surface area of the pyramid   =  100 + 300

∴ Total surface area is 400 cm2.

Cone

Shown above are some conical (cone shaped) objects. A cone has a  circular 
plane surface and a curved surface. The circular plane surface is called the base of 
the cone. The point through which all the straight lines drawn on the curved surface 
pass through is called the "apex" of the cone.

A  cone  is  called  a  right  circular  cone  if 
the line segment connecting the apex and 
the  centre  of 
is 
perpendicular  to  the  circular  base  of  a 
right  circle  cone.  The  radius  of  the  base 
circle is called the radius of the cone. The 
length of the line segment connecting the 
centre  of  the  base  and  the  apex  is  the 
perpendicular height of a right circular cone. Moreover, any line segment connecting 
the apex and a point on the perimeter of the base circle is called a generator of the 
cone. The length of a generator is called the "slant height " of the cone.

It is customary to use —r˜ for the radius, —h˜ for the height and —l˜ for the slant height 
of a cone.

4.2 Surface area of a right circular cone

To  explain  a  method  to  find  the  surface  area  of  a  right  circular  cone,  consider  a 
hollow right circular cone made from a thin sheet. Observe that the base of such a 
cone is a circular plane surface. Cutting open the curved surface along a generator, 
gives a lamina, the shape of a circular sector. 

Given the radius and the slant height of a right circular cone, one can find surface 
area of the cone, by finding the area of the circular base and the area of the curved 
surface.  We can use the formula πr2 to find the area of the circular base. We can find 
the area of the circular sector as follows.

Curved surface

   Circular base

The  surface  area  of  the  curved  surface  is  equal  to  the  area  of  the  sector  that  is 
obtained by cutting it open. Because the arc length of the sector is the circumference 
of the base circle, the arc length of the sector is equal to 2πr. Also note that the 
radius of this sector is the slant height —l˜. Now, as you have learned in the lesson 
on the perimeter of a circular sector in Grade 10, if the angle of the sector is θ then     
θ

2πr × 360  i . e,  θ =

× 2πl = 2πr .  ∴  θ =

360r
l

2πl

The area of the sector with the above angle θ (as learnt in grade 10) is  θ
360

× πl 2.

By substituting θ from the  above equation, we get 

area of the curved surface of the cone is πrl.

Now we can add both areas, to get the total surface area of the cone.

There  is  no  doubt  that  you  know  what  properties  a  sphere  has.  In  mathematics, 
a sphere is defined as the set of points in three dimensional space that lies at  a 
constant distance from a fixed point.  The fixed point is called the centre of the 
sphere and the constant distance from the centre to a point on the sphere is called 
the radius of the sphere. A sphere has only one curved surface, and has no edges or 
vertices.

4.3 Surface area of a sphere

A cylinder with the same radius as the sphere and  height equal to the diameter of 
the sphere is called the circumscribing  cylinder of the sphere. The sphere will 
tightly fit in the circumscribing cylinder of the sphere.

Q

The following fact regarding the surface area of a sphere 
and  its  circumscribing  cylinder  was  observed  by  the 
Greek  mathematician   Archimedes,  who  lived  around 
225 B.C. 

r

 D S

R

When the sphere is inside the circumscribing cylinder, 
any  two  planes  parallel  to  the    flat  circular  surfaces 
of the cylinder  will bound equal surface areas on the 
curved surfaces of the sphere and cylinder.   

For example, in the above figure, the area of the curved surface PQRS on the sphere 
is the same as the area of the curved surface ABCD on the cylinder.   

Now,  if  we  apply  this  fact  to  the  entire  cylinder,  we  see  that  the  surface  area  of 
the  sphere  is  equal  to  the  surface  area  of  the  curved  surface  of  the  cylinder. We 
can  use  the  formulae  2πrh  to  find  the  surface  area  of  the  curved  surface  of  the 
circumscribing cylinder. 

Area of the curved surface of the circumscribing cylinder = 2πr   2r

                                    = 4πr2
            Therefore, the surface area of the sphere =  4πr2

If the surface area is A,

Use a piece of cardboard to construct the hollow cuboid and the hollow pyramid, 
shown in the following figure. The cuboid has a square base with 6 cm sides and is 
of height 10 cm. It does not have a top. The right pyramid has a square base, again 
with 6 cm sides, and the height of the pyramid is also 10 cm. Do not include a base, 
so that you can fill it with sand.

with sand and emptying it into the cuboid thrice, will completely fill the cuboid 
without any overflow.

5.3 Volume of a sphere

Recall the circumscribing cylinder of a sphere, that we leaned about in the lesson on 
the surface area of a sphere. Archimedes, the Greek mathematician who explained 
the surface area of a sphere in terms of the circumscribing cylinder,  also explained  
the volume of a sphere in terms of the volume of the circumscribing cylinder.  Let 
us do the following activity to understand his finding. 

  Activity

 Find a small sphere of radius 3 cm. Using a piece of  cardboard, create a cylinder   
 with the same radius as that of the sphere and height equal to the diameter of the     
 sphere. Do not close the two ends of the cylinder. Now carefully insert the sphere  
 into the cylinder.

not ocupied by the sphere with sand. Cover top with a piece of cardboad and flip it 
over and fill the remaining part that is not occupied by the sphere also with sand.  
Put  the  total  amount  of  sand  that  you  used  to  fill  the  remaining  volume  of  the 
cylinder after inserting the sphere into the cone that you made earlier. Note that the 
volume of sand fills the cone completely.

Let us formulate what you have observed in this activity. 

Volume of the Circumscribing Cylinder = Volume of the Sphere + Volume of the 

Cone  

Therefore, we can find the volume of the sphere by subtracting the volume of the 
cone from the volume of the circumscribing cylinder.

Binomial Expressions

By studying this lesson, you will be able to
  expand the cube (third power) of a binomial expression. 

You  have  learned  in  earlier  lessons  that,  for  a  binomial  expression  of  the  form                  
x + y, its square is denoted by (x + y)2, and that what it means is (x + y) (x + y), 
and that when the product is expanded, the expression x2 + 2xy + y2  is obtained. 
Moreover, recall that x2 – 2xy + y2  is obtained when (x – y)2  is expanded. 

Do the following exercise to recall what you have learned about the expansion of 
squares of binomial expressions.

6.1 Cube of a binomial expression

The cube of the binomial expression a + b , is (a + b)3 . That is, the third power of    
(a + b) ' Note that this is the same as multiplying (a + b)2  again by (a + b).

Carefully observe how the following expressions, involving a power of 3, are 
written.  

       33 = 3 × 32 = 3 × 3 × 3 = 27 
       x3 = x × x 2 = x × x × x
(2x)3 = (2x) × (2x)2 = (2x) × (2x) × (2x) = 8x3

In a similar way, we can write

 (x + 1)3 = (x + 1)(x + 1)2   = (x + 1) (x + 1) (x + 1)
(a – 2)3  =  (a – 2)(a – 2)2   = (a – 2) (a – 2) (a – 2)
(3 + m)3 = (3 + m)(3 + m)2 =  (3 + m) (3 + m) (3 + m)  

The cube of a binomial expression can be expanded in a way similar to how the 
square  of  a  binomial  expression  was  expanded.  It  is  illustrated  in  the  following 
example' 

Example 1  

(x + y)3  = (x + y) (x + y) 2

= (x + y)    (x2+ 2xy +y2)

 = x3 + 2x2y + xy2 + x2y + 2xy2 + y3
 = x3 + 3x2y + 3xy2 + y3 

Accordingly,  let us remember the following pattern as a formula for the expansion 
of the cube of the binomial expression (x + y).  

(x + y)3  =  x3 +3x2y + 3xy2 +y3

cube of the first term 

cube of the 
second term

Similarly, we can write (a + 2)3   =   a3 + 3a2 × 2 + 3a × 22 + 23, and this can be further 
simplified as " 
a3 + 6a2 + 12a + 8 
Now let us consider how the expansion of  (x – y)3 is obtained by taking products.

(x – y)3 = (x – y) (x – y)2

= (x – y)    (x2– 2xy +y2)

= x3 – 2x2y + xy2 – x2y +2xy2 – y3
= x3 – 3x2y + 3xy2 – y3 

Now, let us consider how we can obtain the expansion of (x – y)3, using another 
method.
First, note that we can write x – y as x +  (– y)' Therefore, we can treat (x – y)3 as 
an expression of the initial form, by writing it as {x + (– y)}3' Let us now consider 
the expansion of this cube. 

(x – y)3 = {x + (– y)}3 = x3 + 3 × x2 × (– y) + 3 × x × (– y)2 + (– y)3
   = x3 – 3x2y + 3xy2 – y3 

Note that we have used the properties (– y)2 = y 2  and   (– y)3 = – y 3 in the above 
simplification. 

 According to this, we can also write

(m – n)3 =  m3 – 3m2n + 3mn2 – n3 
(p – q)3 =  p3 – 3p2q + 3pq2 – q3 

Either method can be used to obtain the expansion of (x – y)3.  You may use any 
method which is easy for you.
Let us now consider how the cube of a binomial expression, involving numbers as 
well, is expanded.

7.1 Multiplying algebraic fractions

Two  algebraic  fractions  can  be  multiplied  in  the  same  way  that  two  numerical 
fractions are multiplied. Let us consider the following example.

x
2

×

 x
3

What  we  mean  by  performing  the  multiplication  is  to  express  this  product  as  a 
single fraction. 

To perform this multiplication, we multiply the numerators and denominators of 
the two fractions separately, and obtain a single fraction. That is, 
x    x  ×
2    3

=

x    x×  
2 × 3
 x2
6

=

If  the  terms  in  the  numerator  and  the  denominator  can  be  further  simplified,  by 
doing the simplification we can  express the answer in the simplest form. These 
simplifications  can  be  done  either  before  multiplying  the  fractions  or  after 
multiplying  the  fractions.  Let  us  now  consider  multiplying  two  fractions  where 
such simplifications are possible.

Consider

a

×

 3

.

Here, we can cancel the common factor 2, of the numerator 8 of the first fraction 
and the denominator 2b of the second fraction. We perform this simplification as 
follows.

two fractions separately, we get a single fraction as given below.

We can also cancel the common factors after multiplying the fractions. Consider 
the following example.

2a

2b

6b=
6a

However, by cancelling the common factors before doing this the multiplication, 
you  can  minimise  long  multiplications  and  divisions.  Therefore,  doing  this  is 
encouraged.

Observe how the following algebraic expressions are simplified.

factors if there are any. Consider the following example.

7.2 Dividing an algebraic fraction by another algebraic fraction

Recall  how  you  obtained  the  answer  when  dividing  one  fraction  by  another                 
fraction. You multiplied the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction. 
Similarly, when dividing an algebraic fraction by another algebraic fraction, we can 
instead multiply the first by the reciprocal of the second.

Before we study how algebraic fractions are divided, let us consider the reciprocal 
of an algebraic fraction.  

Reciprocal of an algebraic fraction

Recall the facts we have leaned regarding the reciprocal of a number. If the product 
of two numbers is 1, then each number is the reciprocal or the multiplicative inverse 
of the other number. 

Because 2 ×  2

1 =  1, reciprocal of  2 is 

1  and reciprocal of 
2

1  is 2.
2

Because   × 33

Because  ×    5 4

1

4

 =  1,  reciprocal of 

1  is 3 and reciprocal of 3 is 
3
4  is 
5 =  1,  reciprocal of  
5

5  and reciprocal of  
4

1 . 
3
5  is 
4

4 . 
5

The reciprocal of an algebraic fraction is also described similarly. That is,
if  the  product  of  two  algebraic  fractions  is  1,  then  each  algebraic  fraction  is  the 
reciprocal of the other. 

Let us multiply the two algebraic fractions 

5  and 
x

x  .
5

5
×x

x
5

=  

1
1

= 1.

Therefore, 

5  is the reciprocal of  
x

x  and 
5

x  is the reciprocal of  
5

5  .
x

Similarly, because

x + 1
y

×

y
x + 1

1=  

,

x + 1 is the reciprocal of   

y

y
x + 1

 and   

y
x + 1

 is the reciprocal of  

x + 1 .

Areas of Plane Figures 
between Parallel Lines

By studying this lesson you will be able to

    identify the theorems on the relationships between the areas of triangles and 
parallelograms on the same base and between the same pair of parallel lines, 
and solve problems related to them. 

Introduction

You have already learnt about various plane figures and how the areas of certain 
special plane figures are found. Let us now recall how the areas of triangles and 
parallelograms are found.

When finding the areas of triangles and parallelograms, the terms altitude and base 
are used.  Let us first recall what these terms mean.

Let us consider the given triangle ABC and the parallelogram PQRS.

When finding the area of a triangle, any one of its sides can be considered as the 
base.  For example, the side BC of the triangle ABC can be considered as the base. 
Then AD is the corresponding altitude; that is, the perpendicular dropped from the 
vertex A to the side BC.

We know that,
area of triangle ABC = 

1
2

   BC   AD. 

Similarly, if we consider the side AB to be the base, the corresponding altitude is 
CE. Accordingly, we can also write,  

area of triangle ABC = 

1
2

   AB   CE. 

We can similarly find the area of the triangle ABC by taking AC as the base and 
drawing the corresponding altitude from the vertex B.

Now let us consider the parallelogram PQRS.  Here too, the area can be found by 
considering any one of the sides as the base. If we consider the side QR as the base, 
the corresponding altitude is the line segment PM. The length of PM is the distance 
between the two parallel straight line segments QR and PS, the side opposite QR.

We know that,

the area of parallelogram PQRS = QR   PM. 

Similarly, if we consider the side PQ as the base, the corresponding altitude is RN. 
Therefore we can also write,

the area of parallelogram  PQRS = PQ   RN.

Note
The length of the altitude of a triangle or a parallelogram is also often called the 
altitude.

To recall what has been learnt earlier regarding finding the areas of parallelograms 
and triangles, do the following exercise by applying the above facts.

8.2 The areas of parallelograms on the same base and between 

the same pair of parallel lines

Next  we  look  at  the  relationship  between  the  areas  of  parallelograms  on  the 
same  base  and  between  the  same  pair  of  parallel  lines.  Consider  the  given                      
parallelograms.

Let us see whether the areas of the parallelograms ABCD and ABEF are equal.

Observe that,
area of parallelogram ABCD = area of trapezium ABCF + area of triangle AFD
area of parallelogram ABEF = area of trapezium ABCF  +  area of triangle BEC

Therefore it is clear that, if 
the area of triangle AFD = the area of triangle BEC, 
then the areas of the two parallelograms will be equal.

In  fact,  these  two  triangles  are  congruent.  Therefore  their  areas  are  equal.  The 
congruence  of  the  two  triangles  under  the  conditions  of  SAS  can  be  shown  as 
follows. 

In the two triangles AFD and BEC,

AD = BC

AF = BE       (opposite sides of a parallelogram)

Theorem: Parallelograms on the same base and between the same pair of parallel 

lines are equal in area.

Now  let  us  obtain  an  important  result  using  this  theorem.  You  have  used  the 
following formula when finding the area of a parallelogram in previous grades and 
in the above exercise.

Area of a parallelogram = Base   Perpendicular height

Have you ever thought about how this result was obtained? We can now use the 
above theorem to prove this result.

The figure depicts a rectangle ABCD (that is, a parallelogram) and a parallelogram 
ABEF on the same base and between the same pair of parallel lines. According to 
the above theorem, their areas are equal.

We know that,
area of the parallelogram ABEF  =  Area of the rectangle ABCD

= AB   AD
= AB   perpendicular distance between the 
    two parallel lines 
= base of the parallelogram   perpendicular height

Let us now consider how calculations are done using this theorem.

The area of the parallelogram ABEF in the figure is 80 cm2 while AB = 8 cm.

the same pair of parallel lines.

  (ii)  What is the area of the parallelogram ABCD?
 (iii)  Find the perpendicular distance between the parallel lines AB and FC.
Now let us answer these questions.   

   (i) ABEF and ABCD.
  (ii) Since the parallelograms ABEF and ABCD lie on the same base AB and between 
the same pair of parallel lines AB and FC, their areas are equal. Therefore, the 
area of ABCD = 80 cm2.

(iii)  Let  us  take  the  perpendicular  distance  between  the  pair  of  parallel  lines  as              

h centimetres.  

Then,

area of ABEF = AB   h.

                       80 = 8   h
                   ...  h = 10

     ...  the perpendicular distance between the parallel lines is 10 cm.

Now, by considering an example, let us see how riders are proved using this theorem.

their areas are equal.

         Further,  AB = PC (opposite sides of the parallelogram ABCP)

(since SC // RQ, corresponding angles)

AB = DQ (opposite sides of the parallelogram ABQD)

Therefore, 

area of  ABQD – area of ∆ RDQ = area of ABCP – area of ∆ SPC.

Then, according to the figure,  

area of trapezium ABQR = area of trapezium ABSP.

Therefore,
by subtracting the area of the triangle ABX from both sides, we get

–  area of

8.3 The areas of parallelograms and triangles on the same base 

and between the same pair of parallel lines

You have used the following formula in previous grades to find the area of a triangle.

Area of the triangle = 

1
2

     Base     Altitude

Now we will explain why this formula is valid.

Let us consider the following triangle ABC.

C

A

B

Now let us draw a line parallel to AB through the point C, as shown in the figure, 
and mark the point D on this line such that ABDC is a parallelogram. In other words 
let us mark the intersection point of the line drawn through B parallel to AC and the 
line drawn through C parallel to AB, as D.

C

D

A

B

The area of the triangle ABC is exactly half the area of the parallelogram ABDC. 
This is because the diagonals of a parallelogram divide the parallelogram into two 
congruent triangles. We learnt this in the lesson on parallelograms in Grade 10.

Therefore,
area of triangle ABC  = 

1
2

 the area of parallelogram ABDC

                                   =

Consider again the result that we observed here;

2

area of triangle ABC = 

 the area of parallelogram ABDC.

In section 8.2 of this lesson, we learnt that the areas of parallelograms on the same 
base and between the same pair of parallel lines are equal. Therefore, in relation to 
the above figure, the area of any parallelogram that lies on the same base AB and 
between the same pair of parallel lines AB and CD is equal to the area of ABDC.
Therefore,
area of triangle ABC = 

   (area of any parallelogram with base AB lying between 

1
2

the parallel lines AB and CD).

This result is given below as a theorem.

Theorem: If a triangle and a parallelogram lie on the same base and between the 
same pair of parallel lines, then the area of the triangle is exactly half 
the area of the parallelogram.

Let us now consider how calculations are performed using this theorem.

 (ii) If ST = 6 cm, find the length of the perpendicular RX from R to ST.

  (i)The  parallelogram  PQRS  and  the  triangle  STR  lie  on  the  same  base  and 
between the same pair of parallel lines. Therefore the area of triangle STR 
is half the area of parallelogram PQRS.

Prove that,

    (i) ABFE is a parallelogram.

 ...  ABFE is a parallelogram (since pairs of opposite sides are parallel)

  (ii) The parallelograms ABCD and ABFE lie on the same base AB and between the 

same pair of parallel lines AB and DF.

 ...  according to the theorem,
      area of parallelogram ABCD =  area of parallelogram ABFE

(iii) The parallelogram ABCD and the triangle ACD lie on the same base DC and 

between the same pair of parallel lines AB and DC.

As discussed in section 8.3 the parallelogram related to the triangle PQR is PQRS, 
and the parallelogram related to the triangle TQR is TQRU.

Since the parallelogram related to the triangle PQR is PQRS,

area of triangle PQR = 

1
2

 the area of parallelogram PQRS.

Since the parallelogram related to the triangle TQR is TQRU,

area of triangle TQR = 

1
2

 the area of parallelogram TQRU.

However, since the parallelograms PQRS and TQRU lie on the same base QR and 
between the same pair of parallel lines, by the theorem,
area of parallelogram PQRS = area of parallelogram TQRU.

 the area of parallelogram PQRS =

That is, area of triangle PQR = area of triangle TQR.

As stated previously, the areas of the two triangles PQR and TQR which lie on the 
same base QR and between the same pair of parallel lines AB and CD are equal in 
area.

Triangles which satisfy the above given conditions in this manner are equal in area.
This is stated as a theorem as follows.

Message of the Board of Compilers

This textbook has been compiled in accordance with the new syllabus to be 
implemented from 2015. 

Textbooks are compiled for students. Therefore, we have made an attempt 
to compile this textbook in a simple and detailed manner making it possible 
for you to read and understand it on your own. 

We  have  included  descriptions,  activities  and  examples  to  introduce  the 
subject concepts in an attractive manner and to establish them. Moreover, 
activities are organized from simple to complex to develop an interest to do 
them. 

We have used the terms related to mathematical concepts in accordance with 
the glossary of technical terms of mathematics compiled by the Department 
of Official Languages.

Some subject matter learnt during the earlier grades is necessary to learn the 
subject content in the grade 11 syllabus. Thus, review exercises are included 
at the beginning of each chapter to revise previous knowledge. You will be 
prepared by them for the subject content of grade 11.

In addition, students may use the grade 10 book which you have if you need 
to recall previuos knoweledge.

You will gain maximum benefit from this textbook by reading the chapters 
and       doing the review exercises of each chapter even before your teacher 
teaches them in the classroom.

We  hope  that  studying  mathematics  will  be  an  interesting,  joyful    and 
productive experience.

Introduction

Our    daily  household  expenses  fall  into  two  main  categories  as  capital  expenses 
and recurrent expenses. Recurrent expenses are the expenses we incur on  a regular 
basis and would  include our spending on food, clothes, medicine and electricity 
bills.

Capital expenses are  one-time expenses that are  not repeated on a regular basis.   
For instance   our spending on purchasing a land, a house, a vehicle, machinery or 
furniture is a capital expense.  Such  purchases are generally of significant value 
and may often require a loan from the place of work or from a financial institution.

Money borrowed  as a loan is not paid back in full right away. Rather, it is  paid 
back  over  a  long  period  of  time  as  monthly    partial  payments.Usually  a  loan  is  
expected to be repaid with interest.  The part of the loan and the interest that is to be 
paid every month is referred to as a loan  instalment. However, some manufacturers 
or  distributors  may  sell  their  merchandise  on  an  interest  free  installment  plan  to 
promote sales.

Example 1  
A furniture manufacturer sells a Rs 30 000 worth wooden wardrobe on an interest 
free scheme of 12 monthly payments.What is the amount paid as an instalment?

Instalment amount 

= Rs  30 000

12

= Rs 2 500

Example 2  
A festival advance of Rs 5000 is given to employees of government institutions. 
This interest free advance has to be paid back in 10 equal monthly instalments. If 
each installment is deducted from the salary, what is the amount deducted from the 
salary each month?      

The amount deducted from the monthly salary each month  = Rs  5 000
10

= Rs 500

9.1   Calculating interest on the reducing balance

There are several ways of charging interest on  a loan. Calculating the loan interest 
on the reducing balance is a common method. Let us explore this. 

When you borrow money to repay in monthly instalments, or if you purchase an 
item with a down payment with the understanding that the rest of the money will be 
paid in instalments, most of the time you will be expected to pay an interest on the 
loan. Here, the loan is paid in monthly instalments. The interest calculation is based 
on the outstanding loan  balance. That is the balance money  that remains in the 
borrowers  hands  as the loan is repaid during the loan term. As the borrower repays 
instalments, the remaining loan balance reduces over time. Interest is then charged 
only on the loan amount that the  borrower still holds. Therefore this method of 
calculating the interest is called, computing the interest on the reducing balance.

Once  the  total  interest  to  be  paid  is  calculated,  the  monthly  installments  are 
determined, such that every installment is of the same value.

Study the following examples to understand the  method of calculating the  loan 
interest on the reducing balance and the value of an installment.
Example 1  
Mr Wickramasinghe has borrowed Rs 30 000 as a business loan from a bank that 
charges an annual interest rate of 24%. The loan has to be paid back in six equal 
monthly instalments and the interest is calculated on the reducing balance. Calculate  
the value of a monthly instalment. 

       The loan amount  = Rs 30 000
     Amount due from the principal loan per month without interest = Rs  30 000

6

In this method, the outstanding loan balance is reduced by Rs 5000 every month 
and interest is charged only on the loan balance.

= Rs 5 000

Annual interest rate   
     Monthly interest rate    

= 24%
= 2%

Interest charged for the first month  = Rs 30 000   

= Rs 600

Interest charged for the second month  = Rs 25 000   

Interest charged for the third month 

= Rs 500

= Rs 20 000   
= Rs 400

Interest charged for the fourth month = Rs 15 000   

= Rs 300

Interest charged for the fifth month 

= Rs 10 000   

= Rs 200

   Interest charged for the sixth month  = Rs 5 000

                                                               = Rs 100

The total interest paid  = Rs 600 + 500 + 400 + 300 + 200 + 100

= Rs 2 100

Total amount to be paid after 6 months = loan without interest + interest

The total amount paid  = Rs 30 000 + 2 100

 ...   value of a monthly installment  = Rs 32 100   .. 6

= Rs 32 100

= Rs 5 350

Calculating the interest as in the above method could be lengthy and time consuming.
Therefore we adopt the following easier method to calculate the interest.

Interest charged on amount due per month from the principal 
loan  

= Rs 5 000   

 2
100

Therefore,
the total interest paid  = Rs 100     6 + 100     5  + 100     4 + 100     3 + 100     2 + 100     1   

= Rs100

 = Rs 100 (6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1)
 = Rs 100     21 
 = Rs 2 100

where 21 is the total number of portions of the loan that is to be paid within the six 
months.We will call this the number of month units. We calculate the number of 
month units as

month units = 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 21

This can be thought of as a sum of an arithmetic progression and can be found using 
the formula n
2

 (a + l). Then

       month units

Example 2  
A television priced at Rs 25 000 can be purchased by making a down payment of 
Rs 7 000 and paying the remainder by 12 equal monthly installments. If an annual 
interest rate of 18% is charged on the loan,where the interest is calculated on the 
reducing balance, find the value of a monthly installment.

Price of the television   = Rs 25 000
The down payment   = Rs 7 000

∴   Balance to be paid in installments  = Rs 25 000 – 7 000

Duration of the loan  = 12 month

= Rs 18 000 

 ∴   Portion of the loan paid in one month  = Rs 18 000   .. 12 

∴ Interest paid for a month  unit  = Rs 1 500     18
100

= Rs 1 500

      1

= Rs 22.50

The number of month units the loan is paid over  = 

 (12 + 1)

= 6   13
= 78

∴ Total interest paid  = Rs 22.50    78

= Rs 1 755

∴ Total amount paid   = Rs 18 000 + 1 755

= Rs 19 755

∴  The amount of an installment = Rs 19 755   .. 12 

= Rs1 646.25

Example 3  
The following advertisement was displayed in a shop:

A washing machine worth Rs 30 000 is available for a down payment of                             
Rs 5000 and 10 equal monthly instalments of Rs 2720. 

If the interest on the loan was calculated on the reducing loan balance, calculate the 
interest rate.

           Price of the washing machine = Rs 30 000
            The down payment    = Rs 5 000

  Balance to be paid in installments  = Rs 30 000 – 5 000

  = Rs 25 000 

Portion of the loan paid according to the one month  = Rs 25 000   ..10 

  The amount paid according to the installment plan  = Rs 2 720    10

  = Rs 2 500

     Total interest paid  = Rs 27 200 – 25 000

  = Rs 27 200

   The number of month units the loan is paid over  = 

 (10 + 1)

  = Rs 2 200

 9.2 Compound Interest

An  alternative  way  of  calculating  interest  for  an  amount  of  money  borrowed  or 
deposited  is  the  compound  interest  method.  Let  us  explore  how  the  interest  is 
calculated under this method through an example. 

At a bank that pays an annual interest rate of 10%, the account statement provided 
at the end of 3 years, to a person who has maintained a Rs 25 000 fixed account is 
as follows.

According to the above statement the depositor has earned Rs 2 500 as interest in 
the year 2013. It is clear that the interest earned is 10% of the principal deposit.
The sum of the money deposited in 2013 and the interest earned in the year 2013 
that  amounts  to  27 500  is  considered  as  the  total  in  the  account  on  2014.01.01. 
Furthermore, the interest earned in the year 2014 is 2750 and it is 10% of the total                         
Rs 27500. It is apparent that the interest earned at the end of the year is added to the 
account balance and the interest for the next year is calculate on the new balance.  

In this manner, when the interest is calculated every year, not only the principal 
but the previously earned interest also earns interest. The addition of interest to the 
principal  is  called  compounding  and  the  interest  calculation on  the  compounded 
amount is called the compound interest method.

The compound interest method can be used when calculating interest on a loan as 
well as on a deposit.
Example 1  

If a person takes a loan of Rs 10 000 at a compound interest rate of   10% per  year, 
calculate the total amount required to repay the entire loan in two years.

        Loan amount   = Rs 10 000 

  Compound interest rate  = 10%

     Interest for the first year  = Rs 10 000      10
100

= Rs 1 000

        Loan amount at the end of the first year = Rs 10 000 + 1 000

             Interest for the second year  = Rs 11 000      10
100

= Rs 11 000 

= Rs 1 100

   Loan amount at the end of the second year = Rs 11 000 + 1 100

= Rs 12 100

8

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As in the above example, compound interest can be calculated separately for each year 
and added to the loan amount to find the total loan amount due.

Example 2  
Amal invests Rs 50 000 for 3 years in a fixed deposit account which pays 6% annual 
interest compounded yearly. Nimal invests Rs 50 000 in an account which pays 6% 
annual simple interest. Calculate the amounts received by Amal and Nimal at the end 
of three years separately.

Total amount received by Amal at the end of the first year  = Rs 50 000     106
100

= Rs 53 000.00

Total amount received by Amal at the end of the second year  = Rs 53 000     106
100

Total amount received by Amal at the end of the third year  = Rs 56 180     106
100

= Rs 56 180.00

Interest received by Nimal at the end of the third year 

= Rs 59 550.80

= Rs 50 000       6
100

 3

= Rs 9 000.00

Total amount received by Nimal at the end of three years  = Rs 9 000 + 50 000

= Rs 59 000.00

Total amount received by Amal at the end of three years can also be obtained by 

Rs 50 000     106
100

  106

Share Market

By studying this lesson you will be able to

• identify the stock market and its nature
• identify terms related to the stock market
• calculate the dividends gained by investing in the stock market
• solve problems related to shares

Introduction

In  this  lesson  we  will  consider  businesses  in  Sri  Lanka  which  are  incorporated 
companies registered under the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007.  These companies 
may be owned by an individual or a group of individuals. Of these companies, the 
companies which are limited by shares can be classified as follows.

² Private limited companies
² Public limited companies

Public limited companies raise capital to commence or continue their business by 
issuing shares or debentures to the general public. The public is notified regarding 
the issue of shares through the media. When the public buy shares, they have the 
right to sell these shares to others.  The stock market is where the trading of these 
shares occurs.

Stock Market

The Stock Market (Stock Exchange) is a place where securities such as shares and 
debentures issued by companies are traded. The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) is 
the organization responsible for the operation of the stock market in Sri Lanka. The 
CSE is licensed by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) to 
operate as a stock market in Sri Lanka. The SEC regulates and oversees the stock 
market. Companies are admitted to the official list of the CSE as listed companies.  
On April 21st 2015 there were 297 companies listed in the Sri Lankan stock market. 
The  public  who  wish  to  buy  or  sell  securities  in  the  stock  market  must  register 
with one or more of the 15 licensed stockbroker firms of the CSE who attend to the 
transactions. Some brokers offer trading through the internet.

11

 
 
 
 
 
 
10.1 Shares

Public limited companies which are listed in the stock market, that wish to raise 
capital by involving the public, do this by issuing “shares”. A share is one of the 
equal parts into which a company’s stated capital is divided.

When a company issues new shares, the price of a share is decided by the company 
itself. The public can invest in as many shares as they like. An investor who buys 
shares in a company becomes a part owner of that company. The stake he has in the 
company is proportional to the number of shares he owns.

To understand this further, consider the following example.

An investor buys 10 000 shares from the 100 000 shares issued to the public by a 

certain company. Then the investor has a share of 

10 0 00
100   000

 in the company. Let us 

express this as a percentage.

10 0 00
100   000

 100]   = 10].  

Therefore, the investor has 10% ownership of the company.

Example 1  

Company C which has a stated capital of Rs 10 000 000, issues 100 000 shares to 
the public at Rs 100 per share. Vishwa buys 5000 of these shares.

 (i)   Express Vishwa’s share in the company,

                  (a) as a fraction 

      (b)  as a percentage.
(ii)  Find the amount that Vishwa invested in company C.

(i)    Total number of shares issued by the company  = 100 000

Number of shares Vishwa bought = 5 000

(a)   Vishwa’s share in the company as a fraction =

= 5]

 = Rs 100
 = 5 000
 = Rs 100   5 000
= Rs 500 000

Dividends

When  a  listed  company  issues  new  shares,  it  gives  notice  of  the  benefits  that 
shareholders will enjoy. Dividends are payments out of the earnings of the company 
which some companies give their shareholders as a benefit. It is expressed in terms 
of the amount paid per share.  This is paid out quarterly or annually.

For example, a company may pay its shareholders annual dividends of Rs 5 per 
share. The company has the right to change this amount with time. 

Let us consider again the above example to clarify this further.
Example 1  
Company C pays annual dividends of Rs 4 per share, for the Rs 100 shares it issued, 
of which Vishwa bought 5 000 shares.

(i) Find the annual income that Vishwa receives through this investment.
(ii)  Express Vishwa’s annual income as a percentage of the amount he
       invested.

(i)  The number of shares Vishwa owns   = 5000
Annual dividends per share  = Rs  4 
                 ...  Vishwa’s annual income  =  Rs  5000   4 

=  Rs  20 000

(ii)   Amount that Vishwa invested        = Rs 100   5 000
= Rs 100   5 000

        = Rs 500 000

    ... Vishwa’s annual income as a percentage    = 

of his investment

shares.

of 12%. Show with reasons, which of the two investments is more advantageous.

10.2  Trading in the stock market

We learnt earlier that only listed companies are able to trade their shares in the stock 
market. Let us consider the following note to learn about the trading of shares that 
is done after a listed company has issued new shares to the public.

Nethmi Limited Company which pays annual dividends of Rs 2 per share, issued 
100 000 shares to the public at Rs 10 per share at its initial offering. In a year, the 
value of these shares had increased in the stock market to Rs 20 per share, at which 
time Nadeesha bought 1000 shares. A few years later, when the price of a share in 
this company had increased to Rs 28, Nadeesha sold her 1000 shares.

The  primary  market  is  where  investors  buy  new  shares  issued  by  a  company. 
Shares  can  only  be  bought  in  the  primary  market,  and  the  purchases  are  done 
directly from the issuing company at the initial price stated by the company itself. 
However,  subsequent  to  the  original  issuance  of  shares  in  the  primary  market, 
trading of shares can be done by investors in the secondary market.  The price of 
a share in the secondary market is called the market price. The market price of a 
share varies with time depending on the demand.  

In the above example, the price of a share in Nethmi Limited Company increased 
from Rs 10 to Rs 20 in a year and subsequently after several years to Rs 28.  Such 
increases and decreases in the price of a share occur in the secondary market, where 
investors are able to trade their shares.

Capital Gain

The price at which a share is bought in a company at the initial offering or later at 
the market price is called the purchase price of the share and the market price at

When an investor sells shares he owns he may make a profit or incur a loss. 

When he sells his shares,

if the selling price > purchase price, then he makes a capital gain and 
the capital gain = selling price – purchase price.

Similarly, 

if the selling price < purchase price, then the investor incurs a capital loss and
the capital loss = purchase price – selling price.

Example 1  
Mr. Perera who invests in the stock market, bought 2000 shares in a certain company 
when  the  market  price  of  a  share  was  Rs  20.  When  the  market  price  of  a  share 
increased to Rs 25, he sold all his shares.

(i)  Find the amount Mr. Perera invested in the company.
(ii) Find the amount he made by selling the shares.
(iii) Find his capital gain.
(iv) Express his capital gain as a percentage of his investment.

per  share.  He  spent  the  remaining  amount  to  buy  shares  at  Rs  21  per  share,  in 
Company B which pays annual dividends of Rs 3.50 per share. At the end of a year 
he received Rs 1000 more as annual dividends income from Company B, than the

          The Midpoint Theorem

By studying this lesson you will be able to
   • understand the midpoint theorem and its converse,
    •  perform  calculations  and  prove  riders  using  the  midpoint  theorem  and  its 

converse.

11.1 The Midpoint Theorem

The midpoint theorem is a result related to the lengths of the sides of a triangle. 
Let P be the midpoint of the side AB, and Q be the midpoint of the side AC of the 
triangle ABC. 

A

P

Q

B

C

Then, 

AP = PB  and AQ = QC. 
This can also be written as AP = PB = 

1
2  AB  and  AQ = QC = 

1
2  AC.

PQ is the line segment obtained by joining the midpoints of the sides AB and AC.

Theorem
The  straight  line  segment  through  the  midpoints  of  two  sides  of  a  triangle  is 
parallel to the third side and equal in length to half of it.

In relation to the above figure, according to the theorem,

PQ// BC and

PQ = 

1
2  BC.

22

 
 
 
 
 
 
Let us do the following activity to establish this theorem.

Activity 1  
Construct the triangle ABC such that AB = 6 cm, BC = 7 cm and CA = 8 cm. Name 
the midpoints of AB and AC as P and Q respectively. Join PQ 

  (i) Measure the length of PQ and establish the fact that it is half the length of BC.
 (ii) Check using a set square or by some other method that PQ is parallel to BC.

By doing the above activity, you would have seen that PQ = 

1
2  BC and PQ//BC. 

Let us consider through an example how the lengths of the sides of rectilinear plane 
figures related to triangles are found using the midpoint theorem.

figure.The midpoints of AB and AC are X and Y respectively.

Determine the following.
 (i) The length of XY.
(ii) The perimeter of the quadrilateral BCYX.

 (i) According to the midpoint theorem,
  XY//BC and XY = 
...  XY = 
= 6

1
2  BC.

  ...  the length of XY is 6 cm.
(ii) The perimeter of BCYX = BC + CY + XY + XB

                     = 12 + 6 + 6 + 6
                     = 30
     ...  the perimeter of BCYX is 30 cm.

11.3 Converse of the Midpoint Theorem

Now let us consider the converse of the midpoint theorem.

Theorem: 
The straight line through the midpoint of one side of a triangle and parallel to 
another side, bisects the third side.

P

X

>

Y

Q

>

R

X is the midpoint of the side PQ of the triangle PQR in the figure (that is, PX = XQ). 
If XY//QR, according to the converse of the midpoint theorem, Y is the midpoint of 

PR. That is, PY = YR.

Do the following activity to establish this theorem.
Activity 2  
• Construct the triangle PQR such that PQ = 5 cm, QR = 6 cm and RP = 7 cm.
• Mark the midpoint of the side PQ as X.
• Name the point at which the straight line through X parallel to QR meets the side 

PR as Y.

• Measure the lengths of PY and YR and write down the relationship between these 

two lengths.

• Similarly, if the straight line through X parallel to PR meets the side QR at Z, write 

down the relationship between the lengths of QZ and ZR.

You would have observed by doing the above activity that PY = YR and QZ = ZR. 
This establishes the fact that the straight line through the midpoint of one side of a 
triangle and parallel to another side, bisects the third side.

Now let us consider some applications of the converse of the midpoint theorem.

Example 1  
The bisector of the angle 
ADB = 90x . The straight line through D parallel to CA meets the side AB at E. 

BAC of the triangle ABC meets the side BC at D.

(ii)  
   Since   BD = DC  and  AC // DE, by the converse of the midpoint theorem,

  BE = EA.

P is the midpoint of the side BC of the triangle ABC 
in the figure. The midpoint of AP is Q. BQ produced 
meets the side AC at R.  The line through P parallel to 
BR  meets AC at S. If  AC = 15 cm, find the length of 
AS.

In the triangle APS, AQ = QP and QR//PS. 
Therefore, according to the converse of the midpoint theorem, 
           AR = RS  
In the triangle BRC, BP = PC and BR//PS. 
Therefore, according to the converse of the midpoint theorem,

RS = SC

From  1  and  2  we obtain, AR = RS = SC.

12.1  Finding  the  solution  to  a  pair  of  simultaneous  equations 

graphically

You have learnt in previous grades how to find the solution to a pair of simultaneous 
equations using algebraic methods. We will now consider how the solution to a pair 
of simultaneous equations is found by representing the equations graphically.

Let us consider the following pair of simultaneous equations.

 y – x = – 3
y + 3x = 5 

Let us first solve this pair of simultaneous equations algebraically.

   y – x = – 3 
 y + 3x =  5 

1   
2

2  –  1  gives us, 

(y + 3x) – (y – x) = 5 – (– 3)

    ... y + 3x – y + x = 5 + 3

           ...  4x = 8
             ...  x = 2

By substituting x = 2 in  1  we obtain,
y – x = – 3

         ...    y = – 3 + 2
  ...  y = – 1

 ... the solution is               

x = 2 and y = – 1.

When  these  two  equations  are  considered  separately,  they  can  be  written  as                                       
y = x –  3 and y = – 3x + 5 by making y the subject. Let us first draw the graphs of 
these straight lines on the same coordinate plane. Two tables of values corresponding 
to these equations are given below.

The  graphs  of  the  straight  lines 
drawn  on  the  same  coordinate 
plane  using  the  above  tables  of 
values intersect each other at the 
point (2, – 1). When the x and y 
values  corresponding 
this 
point  are  substituted  into  the 
given pair of equations, it can be 
observed that the two sides of the 
equations are equal. That is, the 
coordinates x = 2 and y = – 1 of 
the  intersection  point  of  these 
graphs is the solution to the given 
pair of simultaneous equations.

This geometric solution to the pair of simultaneous equations is further established 
by the fact that the same solution was obtained algebraically too.

Accordingly, to find the solution to a pair of simultaneous equations graphically, 
the  straight  lines  corresponding  to  the  pair  of  equations  should  be  drawn  on  the 
same coordinate plane, and the coordinates of the point of intersection of the graphs 
should  be  found.  Then  the  x  and  y  values  of  the  solution  are  obtained  from  the                      
x-coordinate and the y-coordinate respectively of the point of intersection.

In  the  following  example,  the  method  of  constructing  a  pair  of  simultaneous 
equations and solving it graphically is considered.

 Example 1

A person buys 10 stamps, some of value Rs 10 and the rest of value Rs 20. The total 
value of the stamps is Rs 120.
 (i) By taking the number of stamps of value Rs 10 that he bought as x and the 
number  of  stamps  of  value  Rs  20  as  y,  construct  a  pair  of  simultaneous 
equations.

 (ii) By solving the pair of simultaneous equations graphically, find the number of 

Rs 10 stamps and the number of Rs 20 stamps he bought.

The relevant pair of simultaneous equations is as follows.

        x + y = 10 
10x + 20y = 120 

1  
2

x + y = 10 and 10x + 20y = 120 are 
represented 
they 
intersect  each  other  at  the  point                
(8, 2). Therefore, the solution to the 
pair of equations is x = 8 and y = 2. 
That  is,  the  person  bought  eight           
Rs 10 stamps and two Rs 20 stamps.

We obtain the following pair of straight lines.

   b.      y = – 2x – 2

2.  A certain school has two Grade 11 classes A and B. If five students from class A 
move to class B, then the number of students in class B will be twice the number 
of students in class A. However, if five students from class B move to class A, 
then the number of students in the two classes will be equal. 

   (i)  Construct a pair of simultaneous equations by taking the number of students 

initially in class A as x and the number of students initially in class B as y.

    (ii) Draw the graphs of the pair of equations on the same coordinate plane and

12.2 The graph of a function of the form  y = ax2 + bx + c  

Let  us  first  consider  how  we  can  use  the  knowledge  we  have  gained  on  the 
characteristics of graphs of quadratic functions of the form y = ax2 + b to study the 
characteristics of graphs of quadratic functions of the form y = ax2 + bx + c.

Drawing graphs of functions of the form y = ax2 + bx + c for a > 0 and 
identifying their characteristics

To identify some basic characteristics, let us first draw the graph of the function                       
y = x2 – 2x – 3. To do this, let us prepare a table as follows to obtain the values of y 
corresponding to the values of x for  – 2 < x < 4.

Before drawing the graph, it is important to consider the range of values that x and 
y take and prepare the coordinate plane accordingly. It is easy to draw the graph of  
y = x2 – 2x – 3 by taking 10 small divisions along the x-axis to be one unit and 10 
small divisions along the y-axis to be two units as scale.

The graph of a function of the form y = ax2 + bx + c is called a parabola. 

We can identify the following characteristics by considering the graph.
•  The graph is symmetric about the line x = 1. Therefore, the equation of the axis 

of symmetry of the graph is x = 1.

As the value of x increases gradually from – 2, the corresponding y value decreases 
gradually until it attains its minimum value – 4 and then starts increasing again.

Let us describe the behaviour of y further for the given range of values of x.
•  As  the  value  of  x  increases  from  –  2  to  –  1,  the  value  of  y,  that  is,  the  value 
of the function decreases positively from 5 to 0. What is meant by “decreases 
positively” is that the function decreases while remaining positive.

•  The function takes the value 0 when x = – 1.
•   As the value of x increases from – 1 to 1, the corresponding y value decreases 

negatively from 0 to  – 4.

•  As  the  value  of  x  increases  from  1  to  3,  the  corresponding  y  value  increases 

negatively from – 4 to 0 .

• The function takes the value 0 when x = 3.
•  As the value of x increases from 3, the value of y increases positively.

By  considering  the  above  characteristics,  the  range  of  values  of  x  for  which  the 
function is negative can be expressed in terms of inequalities as – 1 <  x  < 3.

41

 
 
• The value of y is positive when the value of x is less than – 1 or greater than 3. 
That is, the range of values of x for which the function is positive is x <  – 1 and 
x > 3. 

Let us also pay attention to the following facts.

• It is very important to understand the relationship between the graph that has been 

drawn and the function y = x2 – 2x – 3.

This can be described as follows. 
 (1)  If any point (a, b) lies on the graph, then the equation y = x2 – 2x – 3 is satisfied 

by x = a and y = b. That is the equation b = a2 – 2a – 3 is true.

 (2)  Conversely, if x = a and y = b satisfies the equation y = x2 – 2x – 3, then the 

point (a, b) lies on the graph of the function y = x2 – 2x – 3.

It is extremely important to keep the above two facts in mind. Clearly the point            
(– 1, 0) lies on the graph.  Therefore, x = – 1 and y = 0 should satisfy the equation          
y = x2 – 2x – 3. That is, 0 = (– 1)2 – 2 (– 1) – 3. This can be verified by simplifying 
the  right  hand  side. Another  way  of  stating  this  is  that  x  =  –  1  is  a  root  of  the 
equation x2 – 2x – 3 = 0.  By the same argument it can be stated that x = 3 is also 
a root of this equation. That is, the roots of the equation x2 – 2x – 3 = 0 are the x 
coordinates of the points at which the graph of y = x2 – 2x – 3 intersects the x- axis. 
This can be written more generally as follows. 
The x coordinates of the points at which the graph of y = ax2 + bx + c  intersects the 
x - axis are the roots of the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0.

•  The minimum value of the function is obtained at the turning point of the graph.  
The minimum value is – 4. The coordinates of the minimum point are (1,– 4).

     Drawing the graphs of functions of the form y = ax2 + bx + c for a < 0 

and identifying their characteristics

Let us prepare a table as follows for – 4 < x < 2 to draw the graph of the function 
y = – x2 – 2x + 6.

We can identify the following characteristics by considering the graph.

• The graph which has a maximum value 7 is symmetric about the line x = – 1. 
• Therefore, the equation of the axis of symmetry of the graph is x = – 1.
• The coordinates of the turning point are (– 1, 7).
• As the value of x increases from – 4 to – 3.6, the value of y increases negatively. 
• The function takes the value 0 when x = – 3.6.
• As the value of x increases from – 3.6 to – 1, the corresponding y value increases 

positively from 0 to 7.

• The function attains its maximum value of + 7 when the value of x is – 1.
• As the value of x increases from – 1 to + 1.6, the value of the function decreases 

positively.

• The function takes the value 0 when x = + 1.6.
• As the value of x increases from + 1.6, the value of y decreases negatively.
• When the value of x lies between – 3.6 and + 1.6, the value of the function is 
positive. That  is,  the  range  of  values  of  x  for  which  the  function  is  positive  is           
– 3.6 < x < + 1.6.

• When the value of x is less than – 3.6 or greater than + 1.6, the function is negative.
• That is, the range of values of x for which the function is negative is x < – 3.6 and 

x > + 1.6.

43

• The graph intersects the line y = 0 (x-axis) when x = – 3.6 and x = + 1.6. Therefore, 
the values of x which satisfy the equation – x2 – 2x + 6 = 0, that is, the roots of this 
equation are x = – 3.6 and x = + 1.6.

• The maximum and minimum values that the function takes when 0 ≤ x ≤ 2, are          

6 and – 2 respectively.

12.3 The graph of a function of the form y = + (x + b)2 + c.  

y = + (x + b)2 + c is also an equation of a quadratic function. Here the quadratic 
function  has  been  expressed  in  the  special  form  y  =  +  (x  +  b)2  +  c.  When  it  is 
written in this form, some of the characteristics of its graph can be inferred without

Let us consider the function y = (x + 1)2 – 2. This is of the form y = (x + b)2  + c 
where b = 1 and c = – 2. To draw the graph of this function for the values of x from 
– 4 to + 2, let us calculate the necessary values of y as shown in the following table.

Note: 
This graph has a minimum point. The minimum value of the function is  – 2 (= c). 
The coordinates of the minimum point are (– 1,  – 2), that is, ( – b, c).  The axis of 
symmetry is x = – 1 (That is, x = – b).

When a quadratic function has been given in the form  x = + (x + b)2 – c, the graph 
can  be  sketched  using  the  characteristics  in  the  above  table. The  example  given 
below explains how this is done.
46

 
 
 
 
Example 1  
Sketch the graph of y = –  (x – 2)2  + 3. 

Since  the  coefficient  of  (x  –  2)2   is  negative,  the  turning  point  of  the  graph  is  a 
maximum.  The  coordinates  of  this  maximum  point  is  (2,  3).  The  axis  of 
symmetry  of  the  graph  is  x  =  2.  Further,  to  find  the  point  at  which  the  graph 
intersects the y-axis, let us substitute x = 0 in y = –  (x – 2)2  + 3. We then obtain                                                    
y = – (0 – 2)2  + 3 = – 1.  Accordingly, we can sketch the graph as follows.

y = + (x + a) (x + b) is also an equation of a quadratic function. The function has 
been written in the special form y =  x + (x + a) (x + b). As in the above case, when 
the function is given in this form, certain characteristics of the graph of the function 
can be inferred without sketching the graph. The following table provides several 
such characteristics.

Equation of the 
function

Nature of 
the turning 
point

The coordinates 
of the maximum/ 
minimum point

Equation of 
the axis of 
symmetry of 
the graph

The points at 
which the function 
intersects the x-axis

The 
point at 
which the 
function 
intersects 
the y-axis

To verify the characteristics in the above table let us consider the following example.

Let us consider y = – (x  – 1) (x  – 4).  This is of the form y = – (x + a) (x + b) where 
a =  – 1 and  b =  – 4. To draw the graph of this function, let us prepare a table of                   
(x, y) values as follows.

By taking 10 small divisions along the x-axis to be one unit and 10 small divisions 
along the y-axis to be two units, as scale, the graph of the given function can be 
drawn as follows.

Verify as in the example of section 12.3 that this graph has the characteristics given 
in the table.

When a quadratic function is given in the form y = + (x + a) (x + b), its graph can 
be sketched by considering the characteristics given in the table.

The following example describes how this is done.

Example 1  
Sketch the graph of y = – (x + 3) (x – 1). 

This is of the form y = – (x + a) (x + b), where a = 3 and b = – 1 Since the coefficient 
of x2  is negative, the turning point is a maximum. The points at which the graph 
intersects the x-axis are (– 3, 0) and (1, 0). The coordinates of the maximum point

are  – a + b

The given function can be written as y = (x – 2) (x + 7). 

 (i) The graph is a parabola with a minimum.

given by (– a, 0) and (– b, 0); that is, (2, 0) and (– 7, 0).

Solving Simultaneous Equations

money Malini has and  Rs y be the amount of money Nalini has,
 (i) Express the given information in two equations.
(ii)  How much does each person actually have?

4. ‘‘It costs Rs 65 to buy two books and a pen.You can buy one such book at the 
cost of two such pens.” Construct two simultaneous equations to represent this 
information and solve them to find the price of a book and a pen separately.

13.1 Simultaneous equations with fractional coefficients

We  have  learnt  before  how  to  solve  a  pair  of  simultaneous  equations  when  the 
unknowns have integers as coefficients. Now we will explore through an example, 
how to solve a pair of simultaneous equations when the unknowns have fractions 
as coefficients.

Example 1

Kamal and Nimal have a certain amount of money. When you add  1

Kamal has to  1
3
has is equal to  1

 of  the amount Nimal has to get Rs 20. If   1
4

 th of what Nimal has, find the amounts Nimal and Kamal have 

 of the amount 

 th of what Kamal 

Let  us  see  how  we  can  construct  a  pair  of  simultaneous  equations  to  solve  this 

problem.

Let us take the amount Kamal has as
when you add  1
2
 y, you get  1
is,  1
2
3

 of what Kamal has, that is,  Rs  1
2
 x +  1
3

 y.  Since this is equal to Rs 20 we  get

Rs

x and the amount Nimal has as Rs y. Then,  

  x  to  1
3

 of what Nimal has, that 

1
2

 x +  1
3

 y = 20. 

1  as one equation.

Similarly , since  1
4

  th of what Kamal has is equal to  1
6

 th of what Nimal has, we get

1
4

 x =  1
6

 y  as the second equation, which can be written as 

         1
4

 x –  1
6

 y = 0 

2  

When solving simultaneous equations involving fractions, it often helps to first clear 
the fractions and work with only integers. To clear the fractions we have to multiply 
each side of the equation by the least common multiple of the denominators.

Therefore, equation  1  is multiplied by 6 which is the the least common multiple 
of the denominators  2, and 3 and equation  2  is multiplied by 12 which is the least 
common multiple of the denominators  6 and 4.

58

 
 
 
 
     1    6; 6    1
2

 x + 6    1
3

 y = 6   20

2    12; 12    1
4

     ∴  3x + 2y = 120 
 x – 12    1
6

 y = 12   0

3

          3x – 2y = 0 

4

Now  instead  of  1   and  2   we  can  solve  the  two  equivalent  equations  3   and  4
involving only integers.

3  +  4    (3x + 2y) + (3x – 2y) = 120 + 0
          3x + 2y + 3x – 2y = 120
6x
120
6  = 
6
            x = 20 

By substituting x = 20 in  4

                    3   20 – 2y = 0
2y = 60

y = 30   

...  The amount Kamal has = Rs 20 
     The amount Nimal has = Rs 30

Note: In this problem, once we converted the fractions into integers, we solved for 
the unknown x by adding the equations. Alternatively we can make one unknown 
the subject of one equation and substitute in the other equation to obtain the solution. 
We will discuss one such example now.

          b = 20

Substituting b = 20 in equation  3  (here you can substitute the value of b in either 
equation to find a), we get

                                  a = – 12 +  6

a = – 12 +  6

 b

    20

a = – 12 + 24
a = 12

Therefore the solution to the problem is a = 12 and b = 20.     
We can verify that the solution is correct by substituting a = 12 and b = 20  in the 
original equations.
Let us substitute a = 12 and b = 20  in the left side of equation  1 .

Therefore we can conclude that we have the correct answer.

13.2  Solving quadratic equations by factoring

You have learnt how to find the solutions (or roots) of a quadratic equation of the 
form ax2 + bx + c = 0

Let us review a few a such examples.
Example1  

         Find the roots of the quadratic equation x2 – 5x + 6 = 0. 
            (x – 2) (x – 3) = 0 (by factoring)
  Then either     x – 2 = 0 or x – 3 = 0.
Therefore  x = 2 or  x = 3

 Therefore the roots of the  equation are  x = 2 and x = 3.

Example 2  

Find the roots of 2x2 + 3x – 9 = 0 
                2x2 + 6x – 3x – 9 = 0
       2x (x + 3) – 3 (x + 3) = 0

       (2x – 3) (x + 3) = 0 (by factoring)

          2x – 3 = 0 or x + 3 = 0 

          x = 

  or  x = – 3

3
2

   ...

  x = 1

1
2

 and x = – 3 are the roots of the equation.

Let us look at a more complex example.

Example 3  

Find the roots of  

3
2x – 1

 – 

2
3x + 2

  = 1.

Here  we  cannot  see  the  quadratic  equation  immediately.  But  when  we  clear  the 
fractions, it can be set up as a quadratic equation. For this, we will consider the 
common denominator of the left hand side.(You can also do this by multiplying the 
whole equation by the least common multiple of  2x – 1 and 3x + 2)

 3(3x + 2) – 2(2x – 1)
 (2x – 1) (3x + 2)

64

 = 1 (writing the left hand side as a single fraction)

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       
         3(3x + 2) – 2(2x – 1) = (2x – 1) (3x + 2) (cross multiplying)
                  9x + 6 – 4x + 2 = 6x2 + 4x – 3x – 2 (expanding the factors)
                      6x2 – 4x – 10 = 0  (simplifying)
                        3x2 – 2x – 5 = 0 (dividing the whole equation by 2)
                3x2 – 5x + 3x – 5 = 0
      x (3x – 5) + 1 (3x – 5) = 0
                   (3x – 5) (x + 1) = 0
 ... 3x – 5 = 0  or x + 1 = 0
 or x = – 1

5
 ...   x = 
3
  ...  x = 1
2
 or x = – 1
3
2
 ...  x = 1
 and x = – 1 are the roots of this equation.
3

Now let us consider a problem that can be solved by means of a quadratic equation.

Example 4  

The product of two consecutive integers  is 12. Find the two numbers.

Let us see how we can set up a quadratic equation to solve this problem.
Of the two consecutive integers, let us take x to be  the smaller integer. Then the 
other integer is x + 1.

Therefore the consecutive integers can be written as x, (x + 1) .
Since the product of the two numbers is 12 we get,

 x   (x + 1) = 12.
 ...  x2 + x – 12 = 0

After factoring we get

       (x – 3) (x + 4) = 0. 
This is,  x – 3 = 0 or x + 4 = 0.
 ... x = 3 and x = – 4 are the solutions of the above equation.

If we take x = 3 then the consecutive number is (x + 1) = 3 + 1 = 4.
If we take x = – 4 the consecutive number is (x + 1) = – 4 + 1 = – 3.

Therefore there are two pairs of consecutive numbers whose product will be 12. 
They are  3, 4 and –  4, – 3.

We can  verify the answer by substituting  the two pairs of values in the quadratic 
equation  x2 + x – 12 = 0. 

65

 
 
  
 
If we substitute x = 3 on the left hand side of x2 + x – 12 = 0,
       LHS = x2 + x – 12
      = 32 + 3 – 12
      = 9 + 3 – 12
      = 12 – 12
      = 0
 ...   LHS = RHS
If we substitute x = – 4 on the left hand side,
      LHS = x2 + x – 12

      = (– 4)2 + (– 4) – 12
      = 16 – 4 – 12
      = 16 – 16
      = 0
...   LHS = RHS

Therefore the solutions of the equation x2 + x – 12 = 0 are indeed 3 and – 4. 

Example 5  

The area of a rectangular plot of land is 150 square metres. The length of the plot is 
5 metres more than the width. Let x be the width of the plot.

  (i) Write the length of the plot in terms of x.
 (ii) Set up a quadratic equation in x to represent the area of the plot x. 
(iii) Solve the equation to find the length and the width of the plot.

 (i) Length = x + 5.
(ii) The given data can be shown more clearly by aid of a drawing.

x

150 m2

  x + 5

     Area = length   width

   = (x + 5)   x

  x (x + 5) = 150
This is the required equation.
(iii) Let us solve the above equation.

 x (x + 5) = 150

      x2 + 5x – 150 = 0
 (x – 10) (x + 15) = 0

66

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ... x – 10 = 0 or x + 15 = 0
 ... x = + 10 or x = – 15 

The roots of the quadratic equation are x = + 10 and x = – 15. 
But since a length cannot be negative, the only acceptable answer is x = 10.

Therefore the width of the rectangular  plot = 10 m
The length of the  rectangular  plot  = 15 m 

We  can  verify  the  answer  by  substituting  x  =  10  in  the  quadratic  equation                                     
x2 + 5x – 150 = 0. 

      LHS  = x (x + 5)

      = 10 (10 + 5)
      = 10   15
      = 150
... LHS = RHS

13.3 Solving a quadratic equation by completing the square

We have seen how to solve a quadratic equation by factorization. This method is 
useful only when the factorization is easy to do. Many quadratic expressions, such 
as  x2 + 3x + 5 = 0   and 2x2 – 5x –1 = 0  cannot be factorized easily.To solve such 
quadratic  equations    we  have  to  use  alternative  methods.One  such  method  is  to 
arrange the quadratic as a perfect square. This is known as solving the quadratic 
equation by completing the square. 

Before we proceed, let us recall how we learnt  to write an expression of the form 
x2 + bx as a perfect square.

Activity  
Write the constant you should include to convert each of the following expressions 
into a perfect square and write it as a perfect square.
a. x2 + 6x + 9    = (x + 3)2 
b. x2 + 8x + ...   = ............
c. x2 – 14x + ...  = ............
d. x2 + 3x + ...   = ............

e. (x + ...)2  = x2 + 8x + ...
f. (x + ...)2   = x2 + 2ax + ...  
g. (x + b)2   = x2 + ...x + b2 
h. (x + m)2  = x2 + ...x + m2 

68

  
  
 
First we will complete the square of a quadratic equation which can also be solved 
by factoring.
Example 1  
Solve    x2 + 2x – 3 = 0  by completing the square.

First we will keep all terms containing x on one side and  move the constant to the 
right. Then we get

 x2 + 2x – 3 = 0
                   x2 + 2x = 3

To write the left hand side as a perfect square, take half of the x-term coefficient 
and square it and add this value to both sides. That is, in this problem we have to 
add +1 to both sides.

   x2 + 2x + 1 = 3 + 1
      (x + 1)2 = 4

Take the square root of both sides.  We have  to allow for both positive and negative 
values.  

       x  + 1 =  + 4  

                   x  + 1 = + 2

            x   = + 2 – 1

Then x = + 2 – 1  or x = – 2 – 1         
                     x = 1 or x = – 3
Therefore the solutions to the above equation are x = 1 and x = – 3.

Now let us look at another example.

Example 2  

Solve    x2 – 4x + 1 = 0  by completing the square. 

  x2 – 4x + 1 = 0
                    x2  – 4x   – 1
                           x2 – 4x + 4 = – 1 + 4   
                   (x – 2)2  = 3
                        x – 2 = + 3  ^taking the square root of both sides)

    x = 2 + 3
      x = 2 +  3   or  x = 2 –  3.   

  Suppose it is given that  3  is approximately 1.73 
 Then x = 2 + 1.73 or x = 2 – 1.73 

         x = 3.73 or x = 0.27

69

 
  
                
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Then the solutions of this equation are x = 3.73 and x = 0.27. 
Example 3  

Find the roots of 2x2 + 6x – 5 = 0 by completing the square. 

Here it is easy if we first divide all the terms by 2 to make the leading coefficient 
(coefficient of the x2 term) one.

 = 0   (now the leading coefficient is one)

13.4 Solving quadratic equations by using the quadratic formula

An easy method of solving a quadratic equation of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0 is by 
using the quadratic formula. 

The quadratic formula is derived by completing the square on a general quadratic 
equation ax2 + bx + c = 0. 

Once  the quadratic formula is derived, it is no longer necessary to use the process 
of completing the square to solve "each" quadratic equation.

       ax2 + bx + c = 0

    ax2 + bx = – c

Therefore 
to solve  a quadratic equation of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0

   we can use the quadratic formula 

x =

+– b

b2 – 4ac

 2a

We get two values (roots) for x due to the positive and negative signs.

Here a is the coefficient of x2 

b is the coefficient of x and 

c is the constant term.

Example 1  

Solve 2x2 + 7x + 3 = 0  by using the quadratic formula.

To solve the equation 2x2 + 7x + 3 = 0, we can take a = 2, b = 7 and c = 3 and 
substitute these values in  the quadratic formula x =

other two sides proportionally”,
identify the converse theorem “If a straight line divides two sides of a triangle 
proportionally then that line is parallel to the remaining side”,
identify  the  theorem  “Corresponding  sides  of  equiangular  triangles  are  
proportional”,

The  figure  illustrates  the  line  segment  AB.  The  point  C  lies  on  AB  such  that                             
AC = 2 cm and CB = 3 cm. Point C divides AB into two line segments AC and CB.
Then, the ratio of AC to CB can be written using their lengths as follows.

 AC : CB = 2 : 3
  AC : AB = 2 : 5  
  CB : AC = 3 : 2  
                         CB : AB  = 3 : 5. 

           Similarly   
      hence     

(since AB = 5cm)

The ratio of the lengths of line segments should be written in the order of the line 
segments relevant to that ratio. 

Consider the triangle ABC in the following figure.

A

As shown in the figure, the points P, Q and R lie on each side of the triangle ABC. 
Then the ratios can be written as follows. 

  (i) AP : PB = 2 : 3,   AP : AB = 2 : 5, PB : AP = 3 : 2
 (ii) AQ : QC = 1 : 5,  AQ : AC = 1 : 6, QC : AQ = 5 : 1
(iii) BR : RC = 3 : 3 = 1 : 1, BR : BC = 3 : 6 = 1 : 2

We have already learnt that ratios can be written as fractions. 
Therefore AQ : QC = 1 : 5 can be also written as AQ

14.1 Dividing two sides of a triangle by a line drawn parallel to

Let us do the following activity to find out about the ratios in which two sides of a 
triangle are divided by a line drawn parallel to the other side.

Activity

•  Draw a triangle ABC with AB = 6cm and choosing any length for the other two 

sides.

•  Mark the points P and Q on AB such that AP = 2 cm and AQ = 3 cm.
•  Using the set square or using any other method, draw a line through Q parallel to 

BC and name the point that it meets the line AC as R.

•  Similarly draw another line parallel to BC through P and mark the point that it 

meets the line AC as S.

•  Measure AS and SC.
•  Now complete the following table.

•  Similarly  check  the  relationship  between  the  ratios  in  which  the  two  sides  of 
a right angled triangle and obtuse angled triangle are divided by a line drawn 
parallel to the other side.

Check whether your results agree with the following sentence.

A line drawn parallel to one side of a triangle divides the other two sides in 
equal ratios.

The above result can be given as a theorem in geometry.

Theorem:

A  line  drawn  parallel  to  a  side  of  a  triangle  divides  the  other  two  sides 
proportionally.

As an example, the line AB drawn parallel to the side PR of the triangle PQR is 
shown in the figure.
Then according to the theorem,

P

As  shown  in  figure  (i),  the  line  PQ  drawn  parallel  to  BC  internally  divides  the 
sides AB and AC. But in figure (ii) and figure (iii), the line PQ, drawn parallel to 
BC meets other two sides produced at P and Q. In these kinds of situations, it is 
78

 
 
said that PQ externally intersects AB and BC. Irrespective of whether the sides are 
divided internally or externally, the theorem is valid.

Hence for all three figures above,  

AP
PB  = 

AQ
QC  '

Now consider the following examples with calculations using the theorem.

Example 1     

In  triangle  PQR,  the  line  XY  is  drawn  parallel  to  PR.  Find  the  length  of  RY  if

Here, as in the above example, choose two triangles and in each triangle draw a 
line parallel to a relevant side of the triangle. We choose triangles ABE and ABC, 
because there is a common side to these two triangles.

But there is no line parallel to a side of the ABC triangle. Therefore let us construct 
such a line.

The above theorem says that, in triangle ABC, a line drawn parallel to BC divides 
AB and AC in equal ratios.

That is, since BC//DE, AD : DB = AE : EC. Let us understand the converse of this 
theorem by considering the triangle PQR shown in the figure.

P

A

B

Q

R

Here the line AB intersects the sides PQ and PR. The ratios of the line segments of 
each side are  PA : AQ and PB : BR.

If these two ratios are equal, that is, if PA : AQ = PB : BR then the line AB, which 
intersects those two sides at P and Q, is parallel to the other side QR. This is the 
converse of the theorem we have already learnt in this lesson. This result can be 
stated as a theorem.

The converse of the above theorem: 
If  a  line  divides  two  sides  of  a  triangle  proportionally,  then  that  line  is 
parallel to the other side.

Given below are some examples with calculations and proved riders related to the 
theorem.

Consider the triangle ABC. Then, AD : DB = 4 : 3 and

  ...  The line DE divides AB and AC proportionally.
  ...  By the converse of the theorem, DE//BC.

Therefore in triangle ABF, since DX//BF,

AD : DB =  AX : XF

But AD : DB =  4 : 3 
Hence AX : XF  =  4 : 3

14.4 Similar figures and equiangular figures

Carefully observe the following three triangles.

In day to day language we say that these three triangles are of the "same shape".
The following figure illustrates three quadrilaterals and three pentagons of the same 
shape.

But the following pair of triangles as well as pair of quadrilaterals are not of the 
same shape. 

Did you think of what is meant by "shape" here? In mathematics things should be             
defined precisely. It is necessary to give a precise definition for —shape˜. —Similar 
figure˜  is  the  phrase  in  mathematics  equivalent  to  —same  shape˜  in  day  to  day 
language.  Here we consider only the similarity of polygons.

88

 
                    
 
     
Two polygons are said to be similar if; 

1. the angles of one polygon are equal to the angles of the other and,
2. the corresponding sides of the polygons are proportional. 

As an example, consider the following two quadrilaterals ABCD and PQRS.

There  is  an  important  result  related  to  the  similarity  of  triangles. That  is,  if    the 
angles of one triangle are equal to the angles of another triangle, then those two 
triangles are similar. In otherwords, if three angles of a triangle are equal to the three 
angles of another triangle then the corresponding sides of  those two triangles are 
proportional. Therefore to find out whether two triangles are similar, it is sufficient 
to  check  only  the  angles  of  the  two  triangles. As  an  example,  in  the  above  two 

triangles, if  A

 = P

, B

 = Q

 and  C

 = R

, then

89

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This result is not true for polygons which are not triangles. For example, in  the 
following  two  quadrilaterals,  the  angles  of  one  quadrilateral  are  equal  to  the 
angles of the other quadrilateral. Each of these angles is 90x. However one of the 
quadrilaterals is a rectangle and the other is a square. Therefore their sides are not 
proportional and hence the two quadrilaterals are not similar.

If the angles of two polygons are equal, then those polygons are said to be equiangular. 
According to the above discussion, two equiangular triangles are similar too. Let us 
use this result as a theorem without proof.

Theorem on equiangular triangles:
If  two  triangles  are  equiangular  then  the  corresponding  sides  are 
proportional.

Do the following activity to understand more about this result.

Activity

² Using the protractor, draw two different sized triangles, each with interior angles  
x, 50x and 90x . As shown below, name the  triangles as ABC and PQR .

Q

²  Find the ratios(as fractions) between the corresponding sides of the two triangles.

   That is, find the values of  

AB
PQ , 

BC
QR  and  

CA
RP   separately.

² Check whether these three values are equal.(You can have minor errors because 

of errors in the measurements)

According  to  the  above  activity,  you  can  understand  that  if  two  triangles  are 
equiangular  then they are similar.

90

 
 
 
Note:
1.If restricted to triangles, similar and equi-angular mean the same thing. 
2.It is clear that two congruent triangles are similar. But two similar triangles may  
   not be congruent.
3. If two angles of one triangle are equal to two angles of another triangle, then 
the remaining pair of angles are also equal to each other. The reason for this is 
because the sum of the three angles of a triangle is equal to 180x. Therefore, if 
two angles of one triangle are equal to two angles of another triangle, then they 
are equiangular.

Next we investigate the converse of the above theorem. That is, to find whether 
the statement "if the sides of two triangles are proportional then those triangles are 
equiangular" is true .This converse is true and we can state this result as a theorem.

Also, if the three sides of a triangle are proportional to the three sides of another 
triangle then the two triangles are said to be similar.

Do the following  activity to understand this result further.

Activity

² Construct the triangle ABC with  AB = 2.5 cm, BC = 3 cm and AC = 3.5 cm.            
² Construct the triangle PQR with PQ = 5 cm, QR = 6 cm and PR = 7 cm. 

² Observe the relationship between the values 

AB
PQ , 

BC
QR , 

AC
PR  '

² Measure the angles of each triangles separately.
² What type of triangles are ABC and PQR?

Through this activity you may have observed that the corresponding sides of the 
two  triangles  are  proportional  and  also  that  the  angles  of  ABC  are  equal  to  the 
angles of PQR.

This  result  can  be  expressed  as  the  converse  theorem  of  the  theorem  which  we 
learnt about equiangular triangles earlier.

Theorem: If the three sides of a triangle are proportional to the three sides 
of another triangle, then the two triangles are equiangular.

Data Representation and 
Interpretation

By studying this lesson, you will be able to
 ²  find the limits and boundaries of the intervals of a frequency distribution
 ²  draw the relevant histogram
 ²  draw the relevant frequency polygon
 ²  draw the relevant cumulative frequency curve and find the inter quartile 

range from that curve

Limits and boundaries of class intervals

The following is data of the heights (to the nearest centimetre) of 30 students

137, 135, 141, 147, 151, 135, 137, 143, 144, 145

140, 134, 141, 140, 153, 144, 133, 138, 155, 130

136, 137, 142, 143, 145, 143, 154, 146, 148, 158

We know that the range is the value which is obtained by subtracting the least value 
of the data from the highest value of the data. Therefore,

              The range of the data  = 158 – 130

= 28

To  facilitate  interpretation,  a  group  of  data  is  often  represented  as  a  frequency 
distribution. We know that if the range of the data is large, then the data is divided 
into class intervals. Such a frequency distribution is called a grouped frequency 
distrbution. In such frequency distributions, generally, the number of class intervals 
should be between 5 and 10. The size of a class interval is determined by dividing 
the range of the frequency distribution by the number of class intervals and taking 
the least integer greater than that value .  

For example let us group the above data into 6 class intervals. To find the size of a 
class interval, first divide 28 (the range) by 6 (number of class intervals).

then, we obtain 

28
 6     4.66 '

Hence the size of each interval should be 5, which is the least integer greater than 
4.66.
100

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Next the first class interval needs to be selected. Since the lowest value of the data 
is 130, the first class interval should start from 130. 

The  following  are  two  different  grouped  frequency  distributions  from  the  given 
data.

Class intervals Frequency

 First grouped distribution

 Second grouped distribution

Consider the first grouped distribution. As an example, the 130 - 135 class interval 
represents the heights greater than or equal to 130 and less than 135. The second 
class interval 135 - 140 represents the heights greater than or equal to 135 and less 
than 140. The other class intervals can be described similarly. 

Now consider the second grouped distribution. As an example, the 130 - 134 class 
interval represents the heights greater than or equal to 130 and less than or equal 
to 134.

Let  us  observe  another  difference  between  these  two  distributions.  In  the  first 
distribution there are no gaps between the class intervals. For example, the class 
interval  135  -  140  starts  from  the  upper  limit  135  of  the  previous  class  interval                            
130 - 135. So there is a common limit for these class intervals. But this is not so 
in the second distribution. For example 134 is the upper limit of the class interval 
130-134, but the next class interval starts from 135. The gap between  these two 
limits is 1.

In the next section of this lesson we hope to learn how to draw histograms. To draw 
a histogram, there should not be these kinds of gaps. Therefore we must change 
the second distribution appropriately. This change can be done by introducing  a 
common boundary for the class intervals. That common boundary can be determined 
easily. 
For example, in the second distribution, 134.5 is taken as the boundary of the class 
intervals  130  -  134  and  135  -  139,  which  is  the  exact  middle  of  the  upper  limit    
(134) of the class interval 130 - 134 and the lower limit (135) of the class interval 
135 - 139.The new distribution constructed in this way is given below.

Here observe that, 0.5 is subtracted from the lower limits and 0.5 is added to the 
upper limits of every class interval of the original distribution.This rule is valid for 
the first and last class intervals too. The values 129.5 and 159.5 are obtained in that 
way. Also observe that, the size of the class interval of this new distribution is 5.

In the above, the first kind of distribution is simple. But practically, the second kind 
of distribution can be constructed easily. Both kinds of distributions can be found 
in statistics.

15.1 Histogram of a grouped frequency distribution

Let us consider how to draw the histogram of a grouped frequency distribution. A 
histogram is a graphical representation of a grouped frequency distribution. In a 
histogram, the frequencies of class intervals are represented by the  heights of the 
rectangular  columns  which  touch  each  other.  Let  us  consider  first,  how  to  draw 
the histogram if the sizes of the class intervals are equal.(As in the example in the 
previous section).

When drawing the histogram, follow the steps given below.
²  Mark  the  boundaries  of  the  calss  intervals  on  the  horizontal  axis  drawn  to  an 

appropriate scale.     

² Along the vertical axis, on an appropriate scale, draw the columns such that the 

height of the column on a class interval is the corresponding frequency.

By considering the following example, let us observe how to draw the histogram.

Example 1

Draw the histogram of the grouped frequency distribution prepared in the previous 
section.

Note:  Since  the  data  starts  from  129.5,  it  is  not  necessary  to  show  the  class 
intervals from 0 to 129.5 in the histogram. The mark 
at the beginning of the x 
axis indicates that the axis has been shrunk in this region.

As an example, the interval 0 - 10 represents the marks greater than or equal to 0 
and less than 10. The other class intervals are defined similarly. Draw the histogram 
of the frequency distribution.

In  this  frequency  distribution,  the  first  class  interval  ends  at  10  and  next  class 
interval starts at 10.This histogram can be drawn easily.

Now  let  us  consider  how  to  draw  a  histogram  of  a  frequency  distribution  with 
different sized class intervals.

Example 3

A frequency distribution based on the marks of 40 students in a term test is given 
below.

Class intervals
(Marks Obtained)
Frequency
(Number of students)

0 - 10 10 - 20 20 - 30 30 - 40 40 - 50 50 - 70 70 - 100

If you observe the class intervals, you can see that the sizes of the class intervals 
are not the same. The size of each of the first 5 class intervals is 10 and the sizes of 
the next two class intervals are 20 and 30 respectively. Another important feature 
in  a  histogram    is  that  the  areas  of  the  columns  are  proportional  to  the  relevant 
frequencies. 
104

 
 
 
 
Therefore  if  the  sizes  of  the  class  intervals  are  equal,  then  the  frequencies  are 
proportional  to  the  heights  of  the  columns.  Hence  in  the  above  examples  1  and 
2, the frequency can be identified directly with the height of the column. But in 
this example, since the sizes of the class intervals are not the same, the frequency 
cannot  be  identified  directly  with  the  height  of  the  column.  The  heights  of  the 
columns should be obtained such that the areas of the columns are proportional to 
the frequences. This can be done as follows.

In  this  frequency  distribution,  the  size  of  all  but  the  class  intervals  50  -  70  and               
70 - 100 is 10. The size of the class interval 50 - 70 is 20 and the size of the class 
interval 70 - 100 is 30.

Hence the size of the smallest class interval is 10 and the size of the class interval       
50 - 70 is two times that. Since the area of the column which represents the frequency 
of the class interval should be proportional to the frequency,
frequency 
2

  Height of the column =  

  ...  The height the column of the 50 - 70 class interval  = 

8
2
       =  4

The size of the class interval 70 - 100 is three times the size of the smallest class 
interval.
...   The height the column of the 70 - 100 class interval = 

6
3
       = 2 

After these calculations, the histogram can be drawn as follows.

15.2 Frequency polygon

A  frequency  polygon  is  a  graphical  representation  of  grouped  data  similar  to  a 
histogram. There are two methods to construct frequency polygons.

²  From the histogram of the frequency distribution
²  From the mid-values and frequencies of the class intervals 

In the following example, let us consider first, how to construct a frequency polygon 
from the histogram.

Example 1

Let us consider a frequency distribution used in a previous example.

  (i) First draw the histogram relevant to the given information
 (ii) In each column in the histogram, mark the sign — ˜ at the middle of the top of 
the column. (See the following figure; the signs — ˜  denoted as A, B, C, D and 
E ) 

107

 
 
 
 
 
 
(iii) Join these — ˜signs by the line segments as shown in the figure.
(iv) On the horizontal axis, mark half the length of  the class interval to the right of 
the last class interval and to the left of the first class interval (hence 5 units)' 
Join E F and  A G.

Now you get the polygon ABCDEFG. This polygon is called the frequency polygon 
of the frequency distribution. If you observe carefully, you can see that the area 
of the frequency polygon is equal to the sum of the areas of the columns of the 
histogram.  

To draw a frequency polygon, it is not necessary to draw the histogram first. The 
frequency  polygon  can  be  drawn  directly  by  using  the  mid-values  of  the  class 
intervals and using the relevant frequencies. The following example shows how to 
draw the frequency polygon using this method. 

Example 2

From the given frequency distribution, prepare a table with the mid-values of the 
class intervals to draw the frequency polygon.

Mark  the  mid-values  of  the  class  intervals  along  the  horizontal  axis  and  mark 
the frequencies along the vertical axis. Then mark the corresponding points. The 
frequency  polygon  can  be  obtained  by  joining  those  points  respectively  by  line 
segments.

Here,  the  class  interval  50  -  60  of  size  20  is  divided  in  to  two  class  intervals  of 
size 10 and as the relevant frequency, the frequency of the mid-point of each class 
interval is considered. Similarly the class interval 70 - 100 of size 30 is divided in 

109

 
 
 
 
to three class intervals of size 10 and as the relevant frequency, the frequency of 
the mid-point of each class interval is considered. Also in this case, observe that 
the area of the frequency polygon is equal to the sum of the areas of columns of the 
histogram.

15.3 Cumulative frequency curve of a grouped frequency 
        distribution

This is a another method of representing data of a frequency distribution
graphically.   

Let us see how to draw the cumulative frequency curve by considering the following 
example

Example 1  
The following is a frequency distribution of the marks in Mathematics of 32 students 
in a class. Let us draw its cumulative frequency curve.

The word "cumulative" means "increasing by addition". For example, in the above 
table, the cumulative frequency relevant to the class interval 20-30 is the sum of 
all frequencies less than in the intervals up to the class mark 30. (In other words 
no. of students whose marks are less than 30) That is equal to 20. The cumulative 
frequency relevant to the class interval 40 - 50 is the number of students whose 
marks are less than 50. That is 32, the total number of students. After completing 
this table, to draw the cumulative frequency curve, all the points corresponding to 
the upper limit of each class interval via the relevant cumulative frequency should 
be marked. These points should be joined smoothly, as shown below.

15.4  Quartiles and interquartile range of a frequency distribution

In previous sections, we learnt how to construct a histogram, frequency polygon 
and cumulative frequency curve from a group of data. These are useful to get an 
idea about how far the data disperses centrally. For example, just by looking at the 
histogram,  the  modal  class  of  a  grouped  frequency  distribution  can  be  decided. 
Similarly, an idea on how far the data disperses symmetrically can also be obtained. 
In  this  section,  we  hope  to  learn  about  quartiles  and  the  interquartile  range  of  a 
group of data. From this we can get some idea about the dispersion of data.
112

 
The first thing to do to find quartiles and the interquartile range is to organize the 
data in ascending order. After that the first quartile (Q1), the second quartile (Q2) 
and the third quartile (Q3) can be found as follows.

Step 1: 

First find the median of the data. This is the second quartile.

Step 2: 

Step 3: 

Find the median of the data to the left of the second quartile. This is the 
first  quartile.

Find the median of the data to the right of the second quartile. This is the 
third quartile.

As an example, consider the following group of data which is in ascending order.

Example 1

5, 6, 6, 8, 11, 12, 12, 12, 13, 14, 14, 14, 17, 18, 20, 24, 25, 26, 30

Here,there are 19 data. The median of these is 14 (It is in the square)

5, 6, 6, 8, 11, 12, 12, 12, 13, 14, 14, 14, 17, 18, 20, 24, 25, 26, 30

Now consider the data left of the median.

5, 6, 6, 8, 11, 12, 12, 12, 13

The median of that part is 11. That is also in the square.
At last, consider the data right of the median. '

14, 14, 17, 18, 20, 24, 25, 26, 30

The median of that part is 20. That is also in a square.
Hence,

first quartile  = Q1 = 11
second quartile  = Q2= 14
third quartile  = Q3= 20.

113

Example 2

Let us find the quartiles of the following 18 data written in ascending order .

2, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 11, 11, 12, 12, 15, 15, 16, 17, 20 

2, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 11, 11, 12, 12, 15, 15, 16, 17, 20

Its median is the mean of the 8 and 11 in the rectangle.

Hence,

 Q2 = 

 8 + 11
2

=

9.5

The left side of the median is:

2, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8

The median of that is 6. It is in the square.
Hence Q1=  6.

At last, the right side of the median is: 

11, 11, 12, 12, 15, 15, 16, 17, 20

The median of that is 15. It is in the square.
Hence Q3=  15.

Example 3

There are 17 data in the following data string. Find the quartiles.

102, 104, 104, 105, 107, 107, 107, 108, 112, 112, 113, 115, 115, 119, 120, 125, 126

The heads of the arrows indicate the quartiles which are calculate according to the

There are 16 data in the following data string. Observe how to calculate the quartiles 
which are indicated by the heads of arrows.

Hence,  Q1=

In statistics, there are several methods to find quartiles of a data string. The method 
described here is the most practical and the most convenient method.

Another method to calculate quartiles is, finding the locations of the quartiles using 
the formulae

Q1 in the

 (n + 1) position, Q2 in the 

2
4

 (n + 1) position, Q3 in the 

3
4

 (n + 1) position.

For example, consider the data string  4  6  7  8  15  18  20.

In this data string, according to the formulae, 

Q1 is located at the place 

Q2  is located at the place 

(7 + 1)

 = 2. Hence Q1 = 6.

(7 + 1)

 = 4'  Hence Q2 = 8.

As another example, consider the data string  9  12  18  20  21  23  24  26.
In this data string, according to the formulae,

 = 6'  Hence  Q3 = 18.

 = 6.75. Hence Q3 = 23 +  3

 (18 – 12) = 13.5

Q3 is located at the place  

(8 + 1)

 (24 – 23) = 23.75

Here, when using different methods from each other, different answers with small 
deviations may be obtained. But this is not a problem since in methods of statistics 
it is expected to get approximate values.

The interquartile range of a group of data is the value obtained by subtracting the 
first quartile from the third quartile.

Hence               Interquartile range =  Q3 –  Q1

  More on Interquartile Range

In this section, we hope to learn how to find quartiles and the interquartile range of 
grouped data. Here we describe only, how to find it using the cumulative frequency 
curve. Let us consider how to find quartiles and the interquartile range of grouped 
data from the following example.

Example 1

The following is a frequency distribution prepared from the Mathematics marks of 
a group of students in grade 11. Let us draw the cumulative frequency curve for this 
frequency distribution.

Now let us pay attention to the vertical lines and the horizontal lines in the above 
figure of the cumulative frequency curve.
Here the total number of data is 52. That is, the sum of the frequencies is 52. Let 
us first find, the locations of the first, second and third quartiles of those 52 data. 

Note:  When finding the quartiles from the cumulative frequency curve, there is 
no need to do it as in setion 15.5. Since the number of data is large (More than 30 
data values is considered as a large number of data), it is sufficient to locate the 
positions of  1
 of the frequencies. 
4

4

 of the frequencies,  1

When the cumulative frequency is increasing then the first quartile is located at the 
position of  1
4

 th of the total frequency. Hence, 

the position of Q1  =    

× 52   th position = 13th position

the position of Q2  =

the position of Q3  =    

 3

× 52th position = 26th position

× 52th position = 39th position

Now  it  is  needed  to  find  the  data  corresponding  to  the  points  13,  26  and  39 
(frequencies)

118

of the vertical axis. The necessary lines are illustrated in the figure. As an example 
the first quartile can be found as follows.

Since the first quartile is located at the 13th position, a horizontal line is drawn from 
the point 13 on the vertical axis until it meets the curve. From the point that line 
meets the curve, a vertical line is drawn until it meets the horizontal axis. The value 
of that point on the horizontal axis is the first quartile.  
If we find the quartiles for the given example, then we get Q1 = 26,  Q2 = 42 and                
Q3 = 55'
Hence, the interquartile range = Q3 – Q1 = 55 – 26 = 29.

As an example, if the total frequency of a frequency distribution is 51 then the first, 
the second and the third quartiles are in the

× 51 = 12.75th position

× 51 = 25.5th position

× 51 = 38.25th position respectively.

Hence  the  quartiles  can  be  found  by  considering  the  values  on  the  x-axis  
corresponding  to  the  values  12.75,  25.5  and  38.25  (or  the  appropriate  values 
rounded to the scale of the graph) on the vertical axis.

                  Geometric progressions

By studying this lesson you will be able to,

 ²   identify whether a given number sequence  is a geometric progression,
 ²    use the formula for the nth term of a geometric progression,
 ²    use the formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric progression

  and

²   solve problems related to geometric progressions.

16.1  Geometric Progressions

Let us first recall what we learnt in grade 10 about arithmetic progressions. Given 
below is an arithmetic progression.

5, 7, 9, 11, ...

In this sequence, by adding the constant value 2 to any term, the term next to it is 
obtained. We called this constant value the common difference of the arithmetic 
progression. 

Now, careful observe the sequence given below. 

3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, ...

In this sequence, the first term is 3. The second term is obtained by multiplying 
the first term by 2, third term is obtained by multiplying the second term by 2. The 
sequence continues in this manner, where, each term multiplied by 2 is the next 
term. In other words, if we divide any term other than the first term, by the previous 
term  we get the constant value 2.

A sequence that yields a fixed value when any term, other than the first term, is 
divided by the previous term is called a geometric progression. The fixed value, by 
which each term is multiplied to obtain the next term, is called the common ratio of 
the geometric progression. The common ratio of the above geometric progression 
is 2.

Given a number sequence, one can check whether it is a geometric progression by 
doing the following test. Note down the value obtained by dividing the second term 
by  the  first  term.  Similarly,  note  down  the  values  obtained  by  dividing  the  third 
term by the second term, fourth term by the third term and so forth. If the values 
noted down are all equal, then it is a geometric progression. When the noted values 
are all equal, this common value is the common ratio.   
122

 
 
 
Example 1  

Check whether the number sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, ... is a geometric progression.

   ...    
  ... The  given  sequence  is  a  geometric  progression.  Moreover,  the  common                       
ratio is 3. 

 = 3

Example 2

Check whether the number sequence  200, 100, 50, 20, ...  is a geometric progression.

Because the ratios are not equal, this sequence is not a geometric progression. 

Example 3

Check  whether  the  number  sequence    5,  –  10,  20,  –  40,  80,  ...  is  a  geometric 
progression.

  80
– 40

 = – 2

 =  

 80
– 40 = – 2

 ...  This is a geometric progression with common ratio – 2. 

Example 4

The terms 4,  x,  16 are consecutive terms of a geometric progression. What is the 
value of x? 
x
 = 16
x
4
x by solving this equation.

 because the terms are in a geometric progression. We can find the value of 

123

 
 
 
, then x2 = 64.

If  x
 = 16
x
4
Thus       
...  (x – 8) (x + 8) = 0
...  x = 8 or x = – 8

x2 – 82 = 0

Let us check for each of the values we have obtained, whether the three terms 4, x, 
16 are in a geometric progression. 

When x = 8" the sequence 4, 8, 16 is a geometric progression with common ratio 2.  
When x = – 8" the sequence 4, – 8, 16 is a geometric progression with a common 
ratio  – 2.

16.2  n th term of a Geometric Progression

Recall that you learnt, in Grade 10, that the nth term of an arithmetic progression 
with first term a and common difference d is  Tn  = a + (n – 1) d. 
Let us now consider how we can obtain an expression for the nth term of a geometric 
progression.  We will write —a˜ for the first term of the geometric progression and  
—r˜ for the common ratio. Moreover, we will denote the nth term of the sequence 
by  Tn .
Consider the geometric progression  2, 6, 18, 54, ... . Here, the first term (a)  is 2  
and  the common ratio (r) is 3'

Carefully observe that; 

T1 = 2 = 2   1 = 2   31 – 1
T2 = 6 = 2   3 = 2   32 – 1
T3 = 18 = 2   3   3 = 2   33 – 1
T4 = 54 = 2   3   3   3 = 2   34 – 1

The above expressions can be written in terms of the first term  (a) and the common 
ratio  (r), as

124

 
 
 
 
 
T1 = 2   30 = a   r1 – 1
T2 = 2   31 = a   r2 – 1
T3 = 2   32 = a   r3 – 1
T4 = 2   33 = a   r4 – 1       

According to the observable pattern, the nth term Tn can be written as  Tn  = ar n – 1'
The nth term of the geometric progression with first term a and common 
ratio  r  is given by

Tn  = ar n – 1 '

Example 1

Find the 5th term of the geometric progression with first term 3 and common ratio 2.
  a = 3,  r = 2, n = 5
Tn  = ar n – 1
T5   = 3   25 – 1
   = 3   24
  = 3   16
   = 48
Therefore, the 5th term is  48'

r =

a = 81

      = 81    1

   Tn = ar n – 1 
      = 81     1
         ...      T5   = 81    1
729
3
           = 81    1

Thus, the fifth term is 1 and the seventh term is  1

Similarly, when any two terms of a geometric progression are given,  Tn = ar n – 1 
can be used to find the first term and the common ratio. Consider the following 
example.

48 and 6th term 3072. 

Let us first construct two equations from the given information.

T3  = ar (3 – 1)

                   ar 2

16.4 The sum of the first n terms of a geometric progression

The sum of the first n terms of a geometric progression with first term a and common 
ratio r is denoted by  Sn' Let us now consider finding a formula for Sn '

We can write the first n terms of the geometric progression as,

T1 = a, T2 = ar, T3 = ar2, T4 = ar3, ...., Tn = ar (n – 1).
Sn = T1 + T2 + T3 + T4 + ...... + Tn
...  Sn = a + ar + ar2 +ar3 + ............ + ar (n – 1) 

1  .

We use the following technique to find a formula for Sn. First we will multiply both 
sides of equation   1  by  r. Then we get,

r Sn = ar + ar2 + ar3 + ar4 + ............ + ar n  

2  '

Now, when we subtract  1   from  2 , we get"
r Sn – Sn = arn – a ^observe that many terms on the right hand side cancel&

...  Sn  (r –1) = a (rn –1)
a (rn –1)
 ... Sn =  
(r –1)

  (r ≠ 1)

This is an expression for Sn in terms of a, r, n. By multiplying both the numerator 
and the denominator of the right hand side by – 1, we can also express it as

Sn = 

a (1– rn)
(1– r)

131

 
 
 
 
 
To find Sn , one can use either Sn = 

a (r n –1)
(r –1)

 or Sn = 

a (1– r n )
(1– r)

 appropriately.

Example 1

Find the sum of the first five terms of the geometric progression  2, 6, 18, ..., both 
by finding the first five terms and adding them up, and by using the formula for Sn .

Let us first find the sum by adding all five terms. We are given that 
T1 = 2, T2 = 6 and T3 = 18 

Moreover, 
T4 = 18    3 = 54 and 
T5 = 54    3 = 162 .
Therefore" S5 = T1 + T2 + T3 + T4 + T5

= 2 + 6 + 18 + 54 + 162
= 242

 to find the sum. 

a (rn –1)   
(r –1)
 = 3,  n = 5.  

Now let us use  Sn = 
Because  a = 2,  r = 6
2
a (rn – 1)
r – 1

           and     Sn = 

  S5 = 

2 (35 – 1)
3 – 1

   = 

2 (243 – 1)

  2

   = 

2   242
  2
   = 242

Sum of the first five terms is 242'
When the values of the terms are large or when there are many terms to add, it is 
easier to to use the formula for Sn. 

132

 
 
 
 
 
 
Example 2

Find the sum of the first 6 terms of the geometric progression 120,  – 60, 30, .... 
using the formula. 

a = 120,  r = – 60
120

 = – 1
2

,  n = 6

Substituting into    Sn = 

a (1 – rn)
1 – r

 gives us

S6 =

Therefore, the sum of the first six terms is  78 3

 '

. These are   a, r, n and Sn' 
There are four unknowns in the formula Sn  =  
When any three of these are given, we can find the value of the remaining unknown 

a (1 – rn)
1 – r

by using this formula. Let us consider some examples of this type.

Example 3

Find  how  many  terms  of  the  initial  terms  need  to  be  added  from  the  geometric 
progression 5, 15, 45, ... in order for the sum to be equal to 1820.

The triangles  ABC, PQR and KLM in the above figure are respectively an acute 
angled triangle, a right angled triangle and an obtuse angled triangle. These triangles 
have  been  thus  named,  by  considering  the  largest  (one  or  more)  of  the  interior 
angles. Accordingly, the right angle PQR
 is the largest interior angle of the triangle 
PQR. The side PR which is directly opposite this angle is the longest side of the 
triangle. This side is called the hypotenuse, and the remaining sides, namely PQ and 
QR, are known as the sides that include the right angle.

>

There is evidence to show that from ancient times, man knew about the geometrical 
properties  of  triangles. The  marvel  of  the  pyramids  made  in  Egypt  around  3000 
B.C. is accepted by us all. For such creations, knowledge of geometry, especially on 
the characteristics of triangles is essential. In the “Rhind Papyrus” of around 1650 
B.C. too, the main shape that can be observed is the triangle. Using this knowledge 
on  the  geometry  of  triangles,  in  600  B.C.,  the  Greek  mathematician  Pythagoras 
presented  a  special  relationship  between  the  lengths  of  the  sides  of  right  angled 
triangles. Although there is evidence to show that this relationship was known by 
early civilizations in countries such as China and India, Pythagoras is considered 
to be the first to offer a geometrical proof of this relationship. Later on in 300 B.C., 
the mathematician named Euclid included this result as a theorem, together with its 
proof, in his historical book called THE ELEMENTS.

A  part  of  a  floor  on  which  tiles  of  the  same  shape  and  size  have  been  placed  is 
depicted  in  the  above  figure. The  shape  of  each  tile  is  an  isosceles  right  angled 
triangle. Let us consider the isosceles right angled triangle PQR. The square PQAB  
has been drawn on the side PQ and the square RCDQ has been drawn on the side 
RQ (regions shaded in blue) of this triangle. The square drawn on the side PQ has 
an area equal to that covered by two tiles. Similarly, the square drawn on the side 
QR  also  has  an  area  equal  to  that  covered  by  two  tiles,  while  the  square  PREF 
drawn on the hypotenuse PR has an area equal to that covered by four tiles.  

Accordingly, for the squares lying on the three sides of the isosceles right angled 
triangle PQR, it is clear that the following relationship holds.

Area of square PQAB  +  Area of square RCDQ  =  Area  of  square   

PREF

This relationship can be established further by doing the activity given below.

Activity 

Using a square ruled paper, cut out 3 square shaped laminas and 1 triangular shaped 
lamina as follows.
   (i) A square shaped lamina with side length equal to the length of 3 small squares
  (ii) A square shaped lamina with side length equal to the length of 4 small squares   
 (iii) A square shaped lamina with side length equal to the length of 5 small squares
  (iv)  A  right  triangular  shaped  lamina,  where  the  sides  which  include  the  right 
angle  are  of  lengths  equal  to  the  length  of  3  small  squares  and  4  small  squares 
respectively.

Paste the right triangular shaped lamina on a white paper. Paste the squares on the 
three sides of the triangle as shown in the figure given below.

The area of the square on the side AB  of the right angled   = 16 small squares 

         triangle ABC 

The area of the square on the side BC =  9 small squares
The area of the square on the side AC = 25 small squares

        Accordingly, the sum of the areas of the squares on   
the sides which include the right angle of the 

= 16 + 9 small squares
=

       triangle ABC 

The area of the square on the hypotenuse AC         
of the right angled triangle ABC    

= 25 small squares   
 =

25 small squares

Therefore,  in  the  right  angled  triangle  ABC,  the  sum  of  the  areas  of  the  squares 
on the sides which include the right angle is equal to the area of the square on the 
hypotenuse of the triangle.

This relationship between the sides of a right angled triangle, which was known 
from ancient days, can be expressed as a theorem as follows.

Pythagoras’ Theorem: In a right angled triangle, the area of the square drawn 
on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares drawn on the 
remaining sides of the triangle, which include the right angle.

In the right angled triangle KLM shown in the figure, KM is the hypotenuse while 
KL and LM are the remaining sides which include the right angle.    

  Area of the square drawn on the side KL = KL2 
               Area of the square drawn on the side LM = LM 2
Area of the square drawn on the hypotenuse KM = KM 2

Therefore, according to Pythagoras’ Theorem,

M

KL2  + LM 2  = KM 2

Let us now consider how calculations are performed using Pythagoras’ Theorem.

Example 2
Find the length of CD based on the information given in the figure.

According to the figure, Pythagoras’ Theorem can be applied to the right angled 
triangle ABC.

  ...  BC 2 = AB 2   + AC 2

D

Applying Pythagoras’ Theorem to the right angled triangle BCD,

        CD 2 + BC 2    = BD 2
        CD 2 +  152  = 172  
        CD 2  +  225   = 289
         ...     CD 2 = 289 – 225

  = 64
...   CD = 8 
...  the length of CD is 8 cm.

Now  let  us  consider  how  Pythagoras’  Theorem  can  be  used  to  solve  practical 
problems.

Example 3  
One end of a wire is tied to a ring fastened at a point 1m below the top of a vertical 
utility pole, while the other end is tied to a ring fastened on the ground, 8 m away 
from the foot of the pole. The length of the wire between the two rings is 10 m. Find 
the height of the utility pole. (Assume that the wire is stretched.)

Let us draw the figure according to the given information.                                          

As the pole PQ is vertical, it makes a right angle with the 
horizontal ground. Therefore PQS 
Since QRS is a right angled triangle, according to
Pythagoras’ Theorem,

 = 90x.

Now let us consider how riders related to Pythagoras’ Theorem are proved.

Example 1  

ABCD is a square. Prove that AC2 = 2AB2. 

Proof : ABC is a right angled triangle since ABC 

 = 90x   
Applying Pythagoras’ Theorem to the triangle ABC,
    AC 2 = AB 2   + BC 2
            AC 2   = AB 2   + AB 2   ^AB = BC, sides of a square&
∴      AC 2   = 2AB 2

17.3  Pythagorean triples

In  the  right  angled  triangle  ABC  in  the  figure,  if  the  lengths  of  the  sides  which 
include the right angle are a and b units, and the length of the hypotenuse is c units, 
then we know that a2 + b2 = c2 according to Pythagoras’ Theorem.  Values of a, b 
and c which satisfy the equation 

a2 + b2 = c2 are known as Pythagorean triples.

Since 32 + 42 = 52, we obtain that (3, 4, 5) is a Pythagorean triple. Any multiple of 
the triple (3, 4, 5) is also a Pythagorean triple. 

Eg:  Multiplying each value of the triple (3, 4, 5) by 2 we obtain (6, 8, 10). 
Since 62 + 82 = 102, (6, 8, 10) is a Pythagorean triple. 

9

 
       
 
 
 
 
 
  
Multiplying  each  value  of  the  triple  (3,  4,  5)  by  3  we  obtain  (9,  12,  15).  Since             
92 + 122 = 152, (9, 12, 15) is also a Pythagorean triple. 
There are Pythagorean triples apart from the multiples of (3, 4, 5).

Eg: 

Since 52 + 122 = 132, (5, 12, 13) is a Pythagorean triple.
Since 82 + 152 = 172, (8, 15, 17) is a Pythagorean triple.

A  mathematician  named  Euclid  introduced  “parametric  equations”  to  find 
Pythagorean triples. Given any two numbers x and y, if a = x2 – y2,  b = 2xy and             
c = x2 + y2, then a2 + b2 = c2, and hence (a, b, c) is a Pythagorean triple. 

Eg: x = 6, and  y = 5, then a = x2 – y2 = 62 –  52 = 11   

        b = 2xy  =  2   6   5 = 60
        c = x2 + y2  =   62  + 52  = 61 ' 

Therefore (11, 60, 61) is a Pythagorean triple.

18.1 Right Angled Triangles

We know that we can use Pythagoras’ relationship to find the length of a side of 
a right angled triangle (right triangle) when the lengths of the other two sides are 
given. 

Pythagoras’ relationship cannot be used to find the lengths of the remaining sides 
of a triangle when the length of one side of a right triangle and the magnitude of an 
angle other than the right angle are given.  To identify a method to do this, let us first 
see how the sides of a right angled triangle are named.

 is called the “opposite side”. Moreover, the side BC which

Notice  that  the  reason  why  a  constant  value  is  obtained  for  these  ratios  of  sides 
of  the  right  angled  triangles  in  the  above  figure,  is  because  the  triangles  are  all 
equiangular. The above ratios which are defined for right angled triangles are called 
trigonometric ratios. These trigonometric ratios are called the sine of the angle 30x, 
the tangent of the angle 30x and the cosine of the angle 30x, depending on the sides 
connected  with  them.  “sin”  is  used  for  sine,  “tan”  is  used  for  tangent  and  “cos” 
is used for cosine. Accordingly, the sine of the angle 30x is written as sin 30x, the 
tangent of the angle 30x is written as tan 30x and the cosine of the angle 30x is written 
as cos 30x.

the figure using the notation given above.

magnitude  60x.  We  know  that  when  the  perpendicular  AD  from  the  vertex  A  to 
the side BC is drawn,  D is the midpoint of BC and BAC 
 is bisected by AD. Then

18.4  The Trigonometric Tables

So  far  we  have  considered  only  the  trigonometric  ratios  of  the  angles  30x,  45x 
and 60x. However, there are trigonometric ratios for all angles from 0x to 90x. The 
trigonometric ratios corresponding to these angles have been tabulated. Separate 
tables have been prepared for sine, cosine and tangent. The “degree” which is a unit 
of angles can be divided into a smaller unit called “minute”.  One degree is equal 
to 60 minutes. i.e., 1x = 60'. Trigonometric ratio values for angles in degrees and 
minutes are provided in the trigonometric tables.

In all three tables, the sines, the cosines and the tangents, the first column has the 
angles from 0 to 90x.  The following is a part of the Tangents Table.

22

   
        
                                                                                           
In the trigonometric ratios tables, the first column has the angles from 0x  to 90x 
(Since only a portion of the table is given here, only the angles from 0x  to 4x  are 
shown). The parts of a degree which are minutes are given in the first row of the 
table as  0', 10', 20' etc., and as 1', 2', ...9'  in the Mean Differences column. When 
finding the trigonometric ratio of an angle, the value in the relevant row and column, 
and sometimes the value in the Mean Differences column is used as is done when 
using the logarithms table.

Now let us consider each of the above mentioned trigonometric tables separately.

The Tangents Table

The ratios in the Tangents Table start with 0.0000, increase gradually, exceed 1.0000 
and become extremely large as the angle approaches the magnitude 90x.  Below is 
another portion of the Tangents Table.

Let us first find the value of tan 43x.  The value corresponding to tan 43x appears 
in  the  row  which  contains  43x  and  the  column  which  contains  0'.  Accordingly,                     
tan 43x = 0.9325.
Now let us find the value of tan 48x  20' 

23

We  need  to  move  along  the  row  containing  48x  until  we  arrive  at  the  column 
containing  20'.  Take  the  value.1237  which  is  in  this  position.  Since  the  whole 
number part of the number 1.0117 at the top of the column containing 20' is 1, all 
the numbers along that column should also have a whole number part equal to 1. 
(The reason for writing the relevant whole number part only in the first row is to 
preserve the clarity of the tables).  Accordingly, the value of tan 48x  20'  is 1.1237.
Let us find the value of tan 49x  57' similarly. Here the value of tan 49x  50'  needs 
to be found first. 

tan 49x  50' = 1.1847 

To find the tangent value corresponding to 49x  57', we need to add the value from 
the Mean Differences column, corresponding to 7', which is 0.0048, to the value 
1.1847 (as a convention, the mean difference is considered to be a value with four 
decimal places with only the non-zero part given in the tables).

Then we obtain

 tan 49x  57'  = 1.1847 + 0.0048

= 1.1895  

Example 1
   (i) tan 34x 30'  = 0.6873
  (ii) tan 44x 42'  = 0.9884 + 0.0011

  = 0.9895

 (iii) tan 79x 25'  = 5.309 + 0.044

  = 5.353 

When it is required to find an angle using the tables when a trigonometric ratio of 
the angle is known, a procedure similar to that followed in finding the antilog of a 
value using the logarithms table is used.

Let us find θ such that tan θ = 1.1054 

24

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Find the value in the table which is closest to 1.1054 but less than it.  This value 
is 1.1041.  From the table it can be seen that the angle corresponding to this value 
is 47x 50'. We need to add 0.0013 to 1.1041 to obtain the value 1.1054.  Therefore, 
the number of minutes corresponding to 0.0013 (that is, the value 13 in the Mean 
Differences column) has to be added to 47x 50' to obtain the correct angle.  This is 2 
minutes as highlighted in the table.  Therefore, the angle of which the tangent value 
is 1.1054 is 47x 50' + 2' = 47x 52'.  Therefore, θ = 47x 52' .

Example 2

   (i) If tan θ = 0.3706 
θ = 20x 20'

  (ii) If tan θ = 0.4774   

θ	= 25x 30' + 1' 
= 25x 31' 
 (iii) If tan θ = 0.8446 
θ = 40x 11'

The Sines Table

This table contains values from 0.0000 to 1.0000.  As in the Tangents Table, the 
first column contains the angles from 0x  to 90x .  In the first row right at the top of 
the table, the minute values, namely 0' , 10' , 20'  etc., and in the Mean Differences 
column, the values 1' , 2' , ... 9' appear. This table is used in the same way that the 
Tangents Table is used.

Note: Although the values in the Tangents Table start from 0 and increase to very 
great values, the Sines Table contains only values from 0 to 1. The reason for this 
is because the sine value of an angle in a triangle always takes a value from 0 to 1.
Let us find the value of sin 33x 27'   using the table. 

25

	
	
 
	
First  note  that  sin  33x20'    =  0.5495.  To  obtain  the  value  corresponding  to  the 
remaining7' , move along the row containing 33x and find the value corresponding 
to 7' from the Mean Differences column.  This value is 0.0017.  Add this value to 
0.5495 to obtain the value of sin 33x27' .
That is, sin 33x27' = 0.5495 + 0.0017 = 0.5512.

Example 3
   (i) sin 75x 44'  = 0.9689 + 0.0003

  = 0.9692

  (ii) sin 45x 34'  = 0.7133 + 0.0008

  = 0.7141
 (iii) sin 39x 50'  = 0.6406

Now let us use the table to find the angle corresponding to a given sine value. This 
is  also  done  in  the  same  way  that  we  found  the  angle  corresponding  to  a  given 
tangent value.

Let us find the angle θ if sin θ = 0.5075. It appear in the raw 30x and 30' column.
accordingly if sin θ = 0.5075, the θ = 30x 30'. 

Now let us find another angle using the table.
The angle θ if sin θ = 0.5277.  Since 0.5277 does not appear in the table, consider 
the value 0.5275 which is the closest value in the table that is less than the given 
value. The angle corresponding to this is 31x 50' . Consider the values in the Mean 
Differences column along the same row to find the number of minutes corresponding 
to the remaining 0.0002. The number of minutes corresponding to the value 2 in 
the Mean Differences column is 1'. ∴ The angle of which the sine value is 0.5277 
is 31x 51' .

That is, if sin θ = 0.5277, then θ = 31x 51' . 

Example 4

   (i)  

If sin θ = 0.5831   
then  θ = 35x 40' 

 (ii) If sin θ = 0.7036           (iii) If sin θ = 0.9691  
then θ = 75x 43'

then θ	= 44x 43'

Cosines

Consider the following triangle.

C

90 –  θ

A
B
The above triangle is a right angled triangle with ABC
Then, since the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180x,  ACB

>

= 90x  Let us take BAC
 = 90x – θ.

>

>

θ

 = θ. 

The sum of the angles ACB
pairs of angles are called complementary angles.

 and BAC

>

>

 is 90x' You have learnt previously that such 

If we consider the triangle ABC,

 cos θ = 

>

side adjacent to A
hypotenuse

= 

AB
AC

'

This can also be written as,

 sin (90x – θ) = 

>

side opposite to C
hypotenuse

= 

AB
AC

'

Accordingly, cos θ = sin (90  – θ).

This relationship can be used to find the cosine value of an angle in a triangle.

Example 1

Find the value of cos 58x . 
=cos 58x = sin  (90x  – 58x)  (according to the relationship that was obtained)

= sin 32x
= 0.5299  (according to the part of the table given above)

27

 
 
 
 
               
Example 2

Find the value of cos 56x  18'.
First let us find the value of 90  – 56x 18' . It is 33x 42' .
Therefore cos 56x 18'  = sin (90  – 56x 18' ) = sin 33x 42'

            = 0.5549

We  can  similarly  find  the  angle  when  the  cosine  value  has  been  given.    Let  us 
consider an example.

Example 3

Find the value of  θ	if cos θ = 0.5175.  
Let us write this as sin (90  – θ) = 0.5175.
Next let us find the angle of which the sine value is 0.5175. According to the table 
it is 31x  10' .

Therefore, 90 – θ	= 31x 10' .

The value of θ can be found by solving the above equation for θ.
Then θ	= 90 – 31x  10' = 58x  50' 

Note: The cosine value of an angle in a triangle, like the sine value of an angle in 
a triangle, always takes a value from 0 to 1.  Apart from the above method, the 
cosine  value  of  an  angle  in  a  triangle  can  also  be  found  directly  from  the  Sines 
Table. Observe that in the Sines Table, just before the Mean Differences column, 
there is a column with angle values which are obtained by subtracting the angle 
values in the first column from 90x. The cosine values of angles in a triangle can 
also be found by using the table values corresponding to the angle values in this 
column. However, in this case, the values in the Mean Differences column need to 
be subtracted instead of added.  

Now let us consider how to use the table in relation to cosine values.
Let us find the value of cos 4x  20' using the table.

28

 
 
                                       
                                               
   
Example 4

We need to consider the row corresponding to 4x  in the “degrees” column on the 
right hand side and the column corresponding to 20'  in the “minutes” column at 
the bottom. The value in the table in the row containing 4x, (found to the left), and 
in the column containing 20'  is 0.9971.
Therefore, cos 4x  20'  = 0.9971.

Example 5

Now let us find the value of cos 9x  26' .
We see that cos 9x  20' = 0.9868 and that the value corresponding to 6'  is 0.0003.
Now to obtain the value of cos 9x  26' , the value obtained from the Mean Differences 
column has to be subtracted from 0.9868.

Accordingly, 

cos 9x  26' = 0.9868 – 0.0003
    = 0.9865

Example 6                                                                                                                              
Now let us find the angle θ such that cos θ = 0.4374.

29

 
 
 
                                
  
The value in the table closest to 0.4374 and less than it is 0.4358.  The angle which 
has this value as its cosine is 64x  10'  according to the table.  The value 0.0016 which 
is the difference between 0.4374 and 0.4358 is found in the column corresponding 
to 6’.  This needs to be subtracted from 64x  10'  .
64x  10'   – 6'  = 64x  4'  
∴ the angle θ such that cos θ = 0.4374 is 64x  4'  .

18.5  Solving problems using the trigonometric tables

The types of problems that were solved earlier involving the angles 30x, 45x and 
60x only can now be solved for any angle in a triangle.  It is important to take the 
following into consideration when solving problems related to trigonometry. 

1' Consider a suitable right angled triangle.
2' Select a suitable angle in the triangle.
3' Use a suitable trigonometric ratio corresponding to the selected angle.

Now let us consider some examples.                                 
Example 1    
Find the length of the side AC by using the information in 
the triangle ABC in the figure.

A

10 cm

The angle in the triangle that is given is C. The length that 
is given is of the side opposite this angle. The length of 
the hypotenuse needs to be found. ∴The trigonometric ratio which involves these 
two sides, namely the sine ratio needs to be used.

C

B

57x  32' 

sin 57x  32' = 

      0.8437 = 

...      AC = 

AB
AC  
 10
AC  
 10
 0.8437  

Let us Find this value using the logarithms table.

Let  AC  = 

 10
 0.8437  .
 10
 0.8437 

Then,     log AC = log 

= log 10 – log 0.8437
= 1 – 1.9262
= 1.0738
∴ AC = antilog 1.0738
∴ AC = 11.85

Therefore the length of AC (accurate to the second decimal place) is 11.85 cm.

Here, the right angled triangle that needs to be considered to find the angle ACB
is the triangle ADC. If the lengths of two sides of this triangle are known, then the 
required angle can be found. The length of one of its side, CD has been given as 5 
cm. We need to find the length of one more side. Note that we can find the length of 
AD by considering the triangle ABD. Therefore, let us first find the length of AD by 
considering the triangle ABD and using the sine ratio.

You  learnt  in  grade  10  to  determine  locations  using  scale  diagrams  involving 
angles of elevation and angles of depression. Now let us learn how to find using the 
trigonometric ratios.

Let us consider the following example.

Example 1    
A man is standing on the flat ground at a point C which is 20 m away from the foot 
of a vertical pillar AB. The angle of elevation of the top of the pillar from this point 
is 30x 22'. The man travels 15 m from this point along a straight path away from the 
pillar to another point, and again observes the top of the pillar. 

  (i) Represent this information in a rough sketch.
 (ii) Find the height of the pillar to the nearest metre.

         location.

 tan 30x 22'  =

 = 20   0.5859
 = 11.718

      Therefore, the height of the pillar is approximately 12 m.

(iii) Let us take the angle of elevation of the top of the pillar from D to be θ.
Then, considering the right angled triangle ABD we obtain,

 tan θ	=

 ...   θ = 18x 55'

  ...  the angle of elevation of the pillar from the second position is 18x 55''

Example 2    
A  person  stands  by  a  small  window  of  a  vertical  building  consisting  of  several 
floors. The window is located at a height of 10 m above the flat ground. The person 
observes a motorcycle which is parked on the flat ground a long distance from the 
building. The angle of depression of the motorcycle from the window is 48x 23'. 
The  person  now  ascends  to  the  topmost  storey  of  the  building  and  observes  the 
same motorcycle from another window. The angle of depression of the motorcycle 
when observed from this window is 59x 50' .

18.7  Angles in a horizontal plane

You have learnt earlier that bearings are used to indicate directions in a horizontal 
plane. Bearings provide a measure of an angle that is measured starting from the 
North and moving in a clockwise direction. Bearings are given using three digits.  
In modern measuring instruments the distance is also given with the bearing. 

The point A which lies to the East of P, is located at a distance of 225 m from P on 
a bearing of 090x. This can be represented in a figure as follows.

ratios by considering the following example.

A straight road runs from the South to the North.  When observed from a point A 
on this road, point C is located at a distance of 250 m on a bearing of 220x.  When 
observed from another point B on the same straight road, C is located on a bearing 
of 300x .

19.1 Introducing Matrices

The idea of matrices was introduced in 1854 by the British mathematician Arthur 
Cayley. Let us identify matrices using a simple example. 

The marks obtained by Wimal, Farook and Radha in a term test, for the subjects 
Mathematics and Science are shown in the table below.

The numbers in the table given above can be represented in a matrix as follows.

75  66 
72  70

Here the columns indicate the subjects while the rows indicate the students. This 
information can also be represented in a matrix as follows.

Here the columns indicate the students while the rows indicate the subjects.

The numbers in a matrix are called the elements of the matrix. The elements of a 
matrix, apart from being numbers may also be algebraic symbols or expressions 
which stand for numbers.

Matrices are named using capital letters of the English alphabet. In instances when 
elements are expressed in terms of algebraic symbols, simple letters of the English 
alphabet are used.

The number of rows in A is 2 and the number of columns is 3. Using the number of 
rows and number of columns, we write the order of the matrix as 2 × 3. A is known 
as a “two by three” matrix. 

Accordingly, A is sometimes written as,

A =

Row Matrices, Column Matrices and Square Matrices

Matrices with only one row are known as row matrices, matrices with only one 
column are known as column matrices and matrices which have an equal number 
of rows and columns are known as square matrices. Since the number of columns

and the number of rows of a square matrix are equal, the order of a square matrix 
with two rows and two columns is known as a square matrix of order 2 and a matrix 
with three rows and three columns is known as a square matrix of order 3 etc.

 For example, 
                        A =  3

In the square matrix given above, the main diagonal is highlighted. The string of 
elements from the top leftmost corner to the bottom rightmost corner is the main 
diagonal. 

Note:   The  main  diagonal  is  defined  only  for  square  matrices.  Most  often,  the 

main diagonal is known simply as the diagonal.

The  main  diagonal  of  A  consists  of  only  the  number  1. Apart  from  the  diagonal 
elements, all the other elements are 0. This type of matrix is known as an identity 
matrix.  The  matrix  A  is  the  identity  matrix  of  order  3  ×  3.  Given  below  is  the

Consider  the  elements  around  the  main  diagonal  of  X. The  elements  around  the

The  elements  around  the  main  diagonals  of  Y  and  Z  which  are  equal  are  placed 
symmetrically  about  the  main  diagonal.  Therefore  these  are  symmetric  matrices 
too.

 Note: Symmetric matrices are defined only for square matrices.

19.2   Addition and Subtraction of Matrices

We have learnt how to add, subtract and multiply numbers. We have seen how easily 
we can solve problems by using these mathematical operations. We can similarly 
define mathematical operations on matrices too. Let us first consider how to add 
matrices.

Consider the two matrices A and B given below.

A =

4 
2 
9 

1
0
5

B =

1 
3 
2 

6
9
8

47

 
 
 
 
 
   
  
 
Both these matrices have the same order, 3 × 2. The addition of A and B is defined 
as the matrix which is obtained when the corresponding elements of A and B are 
added together.

Accordingly,

  A + B =

4 
2 
9 

1
0
5

+

1 
3 
2 

6
9
8

=

5       7 
5 
9         
11    13

By corresponding elements we mean the elements which are in the same position 
of the matrix. For example, the element in the first row and second column of the 
matrix A is 1. The corresponding element in matrix B is 6; that is the number in the 
first row and second column of B. 

Now let us consider an example with algebraic symbols. 

If   

X =

x1  x2
x3  x4

and

Y =

y1  y2
y3  y4

then"

X + Y =

x1 +  y1
x3  + y3

x2 +  y2
x4 +  y4

The addition of matrices is defined only for matrices of the same order. Accordingly 
addition of matrices of different orders is not defined. 
Now let us consider how the addition of two matrices is used through an example. 
Even though this example is a very simple one, it shows clearly how matrices can 
be used in practical situations. 

Example 1

Praveen and Tharindu are two bowlers in the school cricket team. The number of

Let us name the matrix which has the information on the one day matches as A and 
the one with the information on the two day matches as B.

Then we can write 

A =

21  23
15  16

and

B =

14  16

In these matrices the columns represent years while the rows represent wickets. Let 
us find A + B. 

A + B  =

35  39
24  35

Think about what the matrix A + B represents. It shows the total number of wickets 
Praveen and Tharindu took in 2014 and 2015 in both one day and two day matches. 
It can be represented in a table as shown below.

The  subtraction  of  one  matrix  from  another  is  also  defined  similarly.  Here,  the 
corresponding numbers are subtracted. For subtraction too, the orders of the two 
matrices should be equal. As an example,

A =

Let us consider another example.

If X is the 3  × 3 matrix with all the elements equal to 2 and Y is the 3 × 3 identity 
matrix, then find the matrix  X – Y. 

X =

 Equality of two matrices

Let us consider what it means when we say that two matrices are equal.

A =

2 
3
10  9

B =

a 
c 

b
d

For A and B to be equal matrices a = 2, b = 3, c = 10 and d = 9.
That  is,  for  two  matrices  to  be  equal,  their  orders  should  be  equal  and  the 
corresponding elements of the two matrices should be equal.

19.3  Multiplication of a matrix by a number

Now let us consider what it means to multiply a matrix by a number. Multiplying a 
matrix by a number means  multiplying each element in the matrix by that number. 
The matrix obtained by multiplying matrix A by the number k is written as kA. Let 
us only consider multiplying by an integer. For example, let

   3   1  0

– 2   8  1

A =

When A is multiplied by 5 the matrix obtained is,

5A =

5 × 3 

  5 × 1      5 × 0

5 × (– 2)   5 × 8      5 × 1

=

  15    5    0

–10   40   5

 .

When A is multiplied by – 3 the matrix obtained is, 

– 3A =

– 3 × 3 

  – 3 × 1      – 3 × 0

– 3 × – 2   – 3 × 8      – 3 × 1

=

  – 9     – 3        0

     6    – 24    – 3

.

Note: The matrix obtained by multiplying matrix A by a number k has the same 

order as A.

19.4 Multiplication of Matrices

From the above definitions you may have realized that addition and subtraction of 
matrices as well as multiplication of a matrix by a number are carried out as for 
numbers. However, multiplication of two matrices is done in a different way. This 
is shown below.

Initially let us look at how to multiply a row matrix and a column matrix. If A is a 
row matrix of order 1 × m and B is a column matrix of order m × 1, then the matrix 
AB is defined and is of order 1 × 1 . To describe how matrix multiplication is done 
in this case, let us consider an example.
52

 
 
 
  
 
Let us assume that 

A =

  a1       a2

  and  

B =

  b1 
  b2

Accordingly, the order of A is 1 × 2 while the order of B is 2 × 1. Then AB is defined 
as,

AB = (a1b1 + a2b2) 1 × 1

Example 1

Find AB  if  

A =

  5 

     2

 and 

B =

  3 
  1

AB = (5 × 3 + 2 × 1) = (17)  

We learnt earlier that any matrix can be multiplied by a number. We also learnt that 
addition and subtraction of matrices however can be done only if the matrices are 
of the same order. Multiplication of matrices too can be done in some cases only. 
Above we saw how to multiply a row matrix and a column matrix. We can multiply 
matrices which are of different orders too. In general,  AB is defined if the order of 
A is m × n and the order of B is n × p; that is, if the number of columns of A is equal 
to the number of rows of B. In this case we get a matrix of order m × p, which is the 
number of rows of A into the number of columns of B.  Let us now consider how 
such products of matrices are found.

As an example, let us see how to find AB if    

A =

  2  4
  3   5

and

B =

  1  8
  6   7

2 × 2

2 × 2

When multiplying the above two matrices, multiply each row of A by each column 
of B, in the same way that we multiplied a row matrix by a column matrix.

  (by finding each product)

=

=

53

 
 
   
  
  
     
  
  
 
 
 
 
The way the above matrix AB was obtained can be explained as below.

²  The element in the first row and first column of AB is obtained by multiplying 

the first row of A (row matrix) by the first column of B (column matrix).

²  The element in the first row and second column of AB is obtained by multiplying 
the first row of A (row matrix) by the second column of B (column matrix).
²  The element in the second row and first column of AB is obtained by multiplying 
the second row of A (row matrix) by the first column of B (column matrix).
²  The  element  in  the  second  row  and  second  column  of  AB  is  obtained  by 
multiplying  the  second  row  of  A  (row  matrix)  by  the  second  column  of  B 
(column matrix).

 Any two matrices for which the product is defined (that is, the number of columns 
of A is equal to the number of rows of B), can be multiplied as above. Let us look 
at a few more examples.

Example 2

If 
=X
defined?

 4    6
 2    3

  and 

Y =

  1    
  7   

 then show that XY is defined and find it. Is YX 

Number of columns in X = 2 and the number of rows in Y = 2. As the number of 
columns in X and the number of rows in Y are equal, XY is defined. 

Now,

=XY

 4    6
 2    3

  1    
  7   

By multiplying each row of X by each column of Y we obtain,

  (4  6)

  (2   3)

=

  4 × 1 + 6 × 7

  2 × 1 + 3 × 7

54

 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Now let us see whether YX is defined.
The number of columns in Y is 1 while the number of rows in X is 2. As the number 
of the columns in Y is not equal to the number of rows in X, YX is not defined.

Let 

=P

    2
  –1

  and Q =

6    3 .  Under  this  section  on  matrix  multiplication 

we first defined the product of matrices of the form QP. This product can be found 
by using the above definition too. That is, by multiplying each row in Q by each          
column in P. 

QP

=

6    3

= (9).

    2
  –1

This  is  a  matrix  with  just  one  element. A  matrix  with  only  one  element  can  be 
considered as a number.  Therefore we write  QP = 9.

Furthermore PQ is also defined. The product of the matrices P and Q, namely PQ, 
is a 2 × 2 matrix.

PQ

=

    2
  –1

6    3

    2 × 6            2 × 3

=

 12       6
– 6    – 3

 Inequalities

By studying this lesson you will be able to

²  solve inequalities of the form ax + b 
  a number line, 

 cx + d  and represent the solutions on 

²  express problems related to day to day activities as inequalities and solve them.

Do  the  review  exercise  given  below  to  recall  what  was  learnt  in  grade  10  about

solving inequalities of the form ax + b

20.1 Solving inequalities of the form ax + b 

 cx + d  

Let  us  now  consider  how  to  solve  inequalities  of  the  form  ax  +  b 
algebraically and represent the solutions geometrically on a number line.

  cx  +  d                          

Example 1

Solve the inequality 3x – 2 > 2x + 1 and represent the solutions on a number line.

When solving the inequality, all the terms with x should be carried to one side and 
the numerical terms should be carried to the other side (as in solving equations.)

3x – 2 > 2x + 1

 3x – 2 + 2 > 2x + 1 + 2  (adding 2 to both sides)

 3x > 2x + 3

To  represent  the  fact  that  3  is  not  a  solution,  a  small  un-shaded  circle  is  drawn 
around the point denoting 3.

Solve the inequality 5x + 3 ≤ 3x + 1 and represent the solutions of x on a number 
line.

5x + 3 ≤  3x + 1 

5x + 3 – 3  ≤  3x + 1 – 3    (subtracting 3 from both sides)

Accordingly, the solutions of the inequality are all real numbers less than or equal 
to –1. The integral solutions of the inequality are all integers which are less than 
or equal to –1. That is –1, –2, –3 etc. This can be represented on a number line as

20.2 Solving problems using inequalities

Example 1

Eight tea packets of the same mass and three 1kg packets of sugar are in a shopping 
bag. The maximum mass the bag can hold is 5kg.

(i)  Taking the mass of one tea packet as x grammes, write an inequality in

 terms of x. 

59

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(ii)  Solve the inequality and find the maximum mass that a tea packet could 

be.

It is easier to work this problem out if all the masses are converted to grammes. 

(i) 

Mass of a tea packet in grammes      =  x
Mass of 8 tea packets in grammes     =  8x
Mass of sugar in grammes 

  =  3 × 1000 
  =  3000 

 Maximum mass the bag can hold in grammes  =   5 × 1000

  =   5000

According to the information given, 8x + 3000 ≤ 5000
This is the required inequality. 

(ii)   8x + 3000 ≤ 5000

 8x + 3000 – 3000 ≤ 5000 – 3000
 8x    
 8
     x ≤  250

 ∴  the maximum mass of a tea packet is 250g.

Example 2

Sarath bought 5 exercise books and 3 pens while Kamani bought 3 exercise books 
and 11 pens. The amount spent by Sarath was greater than or equal to the amount 
spent by Kamani. Moreover, the price of a pen was Rs 10. 

 (i)  Taking the price of an exercise book as Rs  x, write an inequality in terms         

of x.

(ii)  By solving the inequality, find the minimum price of an exercise book. 

 (i)  Price of the exercise books Sarath bought  =  Rs 5x

Amount Sarath spent  
Similarly, the amount Kamani spent 

=  Rs 5x + 30

        5x + 30 ≥ 3x + 110 

This is the required inequality.

(ii) 

   5x + 30 ≥ 3x + 110 
   5x + 30 – 30 ≥ 3x + 110 – 30

 5x  ≥ 3x + 80
 5x – 3x ≥ 3x + 80 –  3x
≥  80

                    Cyclic Quadrilaterals

By studying this lesson you will be able to,

   •  identify  cyclic  quadrilaterals  and  identify  the  theorem  that  “the  opposite 

angles of a cyclic quadrilateral are supplementary” and its converse,

   •  identify the theorem that “if one side of a cyclic quadrilateral is produced, 
the exterior angle so formed is equal to the interior opposite angle of the 
quadrilateral”.

21.1   Cyclic quadrilaterals

A quadrilateral which has all four vertices on the same circle is known as a cyclic 
quadrilateral.

It  is  clear  that  the  quadrilaterals  in  figures  (i)  and  (ii)  are  cyclic  quadrilaterals 
while the quadrilaterals in figures (iii) and (iv) are not cyclic quadrilaterals.

In a quadrilateral, the angle which is opposite a given angle is known as the “opposite 
angle”. For example, in the quadrilateral shown below, R
 is the opposite angle of P
and S

  is the opposite angle of Q

.

Q

P

R

To understand the relationship between opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral let 
us do the following activity.

² Draw a cyclic quadrilateral as shown in the figure.
² Cut and separate out the angles in the cyclic quadrilateral.
² From the angles that were cut out, take the angles p and r and paste them on a 
piece of paper such that they are adjacent angles and see whether they form a pair 
of supplementary angles (that is, whether the sum of the magnitudes is 180x.) Do 
the same with the angles q and s.

²  What  is  the  conclusion  you  can  draw  regarding  opposite  angles  of  a  cyclic 

quadrilateral?

You would have observed the p +  r = 180x and q + s = 180x. This relationship can 
be written as a theorem in the following form.

Theorem: The opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral are supplementary.

According to this theorem, in the above figure,

  ABC 
               DCB

 = 180x

Let us now see how calculations are performed using the above theorem.

Example 1

Find the values of x and y in the cyclic quadrilateral ABCD shown in the figure. 

Since  the  opposite  angles  of  a  cyclic  quadrilateral  are 
supplementary,   

70x

D

        70x + y = 180x

   ∴   y = 180x – 70x 
       y = 110x

Since the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral are supplementary, 

         x + 2x = 180x
    3x = 180x
∴  x = 60x

 (OA and OB are equal as they are radii of the same circle)

  ...  p + p + 50x = 180x (interior angles of the triangle OAB) 

       ... p =  180x – 50x
   = 65x

       2

  As the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral add up to 180x,

>

      75x + DAB 
       DAB 

>

 = 180x
 = 180x – 75x
    = 105x

>

 = 105x
      BAO 
 + OAD
        ...   65x + r = 105x

               r = 105x – 65x
 r = 40x

     As allied angles add up to 180x,

 t + 105x = 180x
...           t = 180x – 105x
  t = 75x

But,    AOC
               ...  2 ADC
           Therefore, ADC
We can join OB and OD, and similarly prove that  DAB

 + 2 ABC 
= 360x (angles around a point)
= 360x 
 = 180x

  (reflex)   = 2 ADC

...  The opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral are supplementary.
The converse of this theorem is also true. That is, if the sum of the opposite angles 
of a quadrilateral is 180x, then its vertices lie on a circle. We can write this as a 
theorem as below.

The  relationship  between  an  exterior  angle  and  the  interior  opposite  angle  of  a

so formed is equal to the interior opposite angle of the quadrilateral.

         Tangents

By studying this lesson you will be able to,

   ²    identify the tangent which is drawn through a point on a circle and its 

  characteristics,

   ²    identify the tangents drawn to a circle from an external point and their 

  characteristics,   

   ²    identify the angles in the alternate segment and solve related problems.

Figure (i) 

Figure (ii) 

Figure (iii) 

In Figure (i), the circle and the straight line have no points in common. Therefore 
the straight line is situated external to the circle. 

In Figure (ii), the circle and the straight line intersect at two points. Therefore the 
circle and the straight line have two points in common. The straight line is known 
as a secant of the circle. 

In  Figure  (iii),  the  circle  and  the  straight  line  have  one  point  in  common.  Here 
the  straight  line  touches  the  circle  and  therefore  the  straight  line  is  known  as  a 
“tangent” of the circle. The point which is common to the tangent and the circle is 
known as the tangential point.

the radius, consider the facts given below. 

O

B

A

C

>

O is the centre of the circle in the figure. The radius drawn through the point A 
which is on the circle is OA. The line drawn perpendicular to the radius OA through 
A is BC. It is clear that OAC
That is,
the line BC drawn perpendicular to the radius OA through the point A is a tangent 
to the circle. 
This result can be written as a theorem as follows. 

= 90x and that BC is a tangent to the circle. 

Theorem: The straight line drawn through a point on a circle and perpendicular 

to the radius through the point of contact, is a tangent to the circle.

Furthermore the converse of the above theorem is also true.

That is,

if a tangent is drawn to the circle through a particular point, then the radius that 
passes through that point and the said tangent are perpendicular to each other. 

This result too can be written as a theorem as follows.

Converse of the theorem: The tangent through a point on a circle is perpendicular 

to the radius drawn to the point of contact.

Let us consider a point P which is external to the circle with centre O.

P

Two tangents to the circle that pass through the point P can be drawn. These two 
tangents are shown in the following figure.

O

A

B

P

These two tangents are known as the tangents drawn to the circle from the external 
point P. 

Understand that there are two tangents that can be drawn to a circle from an external 
point  P  irrespective  of  where  the  point  is  located.  In  the  figure  below  are  three 
points P, Q and R through which two tangents each are drawn.

point to a circle. 
Let us mark A and B as the tangential points and OA and OB as the respective radii. 
Let us also draw the straight line segment OP.

As  learnt  in  section  22.1  above,  tangents  are  perpendicular  to  the  radii  drawn 
through the tangential points. This is indicated in the above figure.

Observing the triangles OAP and OBP, we might guess that they are congruent, 
based  on  symmetry.  In  fact  they  are  congruent.  This  can  easily  be  proved.  Let 
us see how this is proved. First observe that they are both right angled triangles. 
Therefore if we show that the hypotenuse and one side of one triangle are equal to 
the hypotenuse and corresponding side of the other triangle, we can conclude that 
they are congruent under the RHS (Hyp.S) case. In both triangles, the hypotenuse is 
the common side OP. Furthermore, since OA and OB are both radii, they are equal 
in length. Accordingly, these two triangles are congruent under the RHS case. As 
they are congruent,

The above considered facts are expressed as a theorem as follows.

Theorem: If two tangents are drawn to a circle from an external point, then,

 (i)  the two tangents are equal in length.
  (ii)  the angle between the tangents is bisected by the straight line joining the 

external point to the centre.

(iii) the tangents subtend equal angles at the centre.

figure.

C

As shown in the figure, the straight line AB touches the circle at the point C. In the 
figure, CD is a chord. The circle is divided into two segments by the chord CD. 
One segment is the portion which is shaded light blue. The other segment is the 
smaller  portion  which  is  not  shaded. There  are  two  angles  formed  by  the  chord 
CD meeting the tangent AB. One angle is ACD
 The alternate 
segment corresponding to the angle BCD
is the portion shaded light blue. Similarly, 
the alternate segment corresponding to the angle ACD
 is the portion of the circle 
which is not shaded.   

. The other is BCD

There is a special relationship involving tangents of a circle. For the above figure,

it means that the angles  DCB 
 are equal. In other words, “The angles which a tangent to a circle makes 
and  CYD
with a chord drawn from the point of contact are respectively equal to the angles in 
the alternate segments of the circle”. This is a very important result. Therefore let

    Constructions

By studying this lesson you will be able to,

•   do constructions related to straight lines and angles,
•   construct circles related to triangles,
•   construct tangents to circles.

23.1 Constructions related to straight lines and angles

Let  us  learn  some  constructions  which  will  be  required  in  the  constructions  that 
will be studied later on.  We use only a pair of compasses and a straight edge to do 
constructions.

1. Construction of the perpendicular bisector of a straight line segment

The  perpendicular  bisector  of  a  straight  line  segment  is  the  line  drawn 
perpendicular to the straight line segment through its midpoint.
Let us consider a straight line segment  AB.

A

B

Step 1:    Take a length of a little more than half the length of AB onto the pair 
of compasses. Taking A as the centre, draw two arcs above and below 
the straight line segment.

Step 2:    Using the same length (i.e., without altering the pair of compasses) and 
taking B as the centre, draw another two arcs such that they intersect the
two arcs drawn earlier.

Step 3:    Name the two points of intersection as C and D. Draw a straight line

segment joining C to D.

Step 4:   Name the point where this straight line segment intersects AB as X.

Step 1:    Take a length which is less than OA and OB onto the pair of compasses. 
  Taking O as the centre, draw an arc such that it intersects both OA and 
  OB.

Step 2:   Name the two points of intersection of the arc with OA and OB as C  

and D.

Step 3:    Taking a suitable length onto the pair of compasses, and taking C and D 
as the centres, draw two arcs which intersect each other. Name the point 
of intersection of the two arcs as E. 

Step 4:  

Join O and E.

3. Construction of a perpendicular to a line through a given point on the line. 

Let  us  assume  that  we  want  to  draw  a  perpendicular  to  AB  through  the  point  C 
which is on AB.

C

B

Step 1:   Take a suitable length onto the pair of compasses and taking C as the 

  centre, draw two arcs that intersect the straight line segment AB on the 

two sides of C.

Step 2:   Name the two points of intersection as P and Q. 

Step 3:   Taking P and Q as the centres and using a fixed radius, draw two arcs 
  above or below the line AB such that they intersect each other. 

Step 4:   Name the point of intersection of the two arcs as R, and join  CR with a

point

Let AB be a straight line segment and C an external point.

B

Step 1:   Take a length which is a little more than the distance from C to AB onto

the pair of compasses. Taking C as the centre, draw two arcs which 
intersect AB.

Step 2:   Name the two points of intersection as D and E.

Step 3:    Taking the same radius (or another suitable one), draw two intersecting 
arcs taking D and E as the centres, on the side of AB opposite to that on

  which C lies. 

Step 4:   Name the point of intersection of the two arcs as P and join CP. Name

23.2 Construction of circles related to triangles

You have learnt earlier how to construct triangles using a straight edge and a pair of 
compasses when lengths of the sides of the triangle and magnitudes of the angles 
are  given.  Now  let  us  learn  how  to  construct  circles  related  to  triangles  in  three 
cases, using only a straight edge and a pair of compasses.

triangle

105

 
 
 
                   
Step 1:   Using the pair of compasses, draw the perpendicular bisectors of any two 

  of the three sides AB, BC and CA of the triangle ABC.

Step 2:   Name the point of intersection of these perpendicular bisectors as O. 

C

O

Step 3:   Taking O as the centre and the distance from any vertex of the triangle to 

  O as the radius, draw a circle.

A

B

Observe that the constructed circle passes through all the vertices of the triangle 
ABC. This circle is known as the circumcircle of the triangle ABC. The centre of 
this circle is known as the circumcentre of the triangle.

Draw  a  right  angled  triangle  and  an  obtuse  angled  triangle  and  construct  the 
circumcircle of each triangle.

Using the above constructions, fill in the table given below.

Construction of the incircle (inscribed circle) of a triangle

Draw a triangle and name it ABC.

                  A

B

Step 1:    Using the pair of compasses construct the angle bisectors of any two 

interior angles of the triangle ABC.

Step 2:   Name the point at which the angle bisectors meet as X.

C

X

A

Step 3:   Construct a perpendicular from X to any one of the three sides of the

triangle. Name the foot of that perpendicular as P.

You can see that the circle which was constructed touches the three sides AB, BC 
and CA internally. Therefore it is called the incircle of the triangle ABC. The centre 
of this circle is known as the incentre of the triangle.

Observe  that  the  circle  touches  the  side  BC  and  the  sides  AC  and  AB  produced 
externally.  Therefore  it  is  named  the  excircle  of  the  triangle  ABC.  Its  centre  is 
known as the excentre of the triangle.

Note:   The excircle that touches the side AB and the sides CB and CA produced, 
as well as the excircle that touches the side CA and the sides BA and BC 
produced can also be constructed similarly. It is clear therefore that each 
triangle has three excircles.

23.3 Construction of a tangent to a circle

Let us recall two theorems we learnt in the lesson on tangents.

1. The straight line drawn through a point on a circle and perpendicular to the radius 

through the point of contact is a tangent to the circle.

2.  The  tangents  drawn  to  a  circle  from  an  external  point  (exterior)  are  equal  in 

length. 

Now let us consider how to construct tangents to circles using the above theorems.

Construction of a tangent to a circle through a point on the circle

To construct this, let us use the theorem, “The straight line drawn through a point 
on a circle and perpendicular to the radius through the point of contact is a tangent 
to the circle.”

Let the centre of the given circle be O and X be a point on it.  

O

X

Step 1:   Draw the line OX and mark a point P on OX produced.

X

P

112

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 2:    Using the pair of compasses, construct a perpendicular to OP                 

through X. 

  To do this, use the knowledge on constructing a perpendicular to a  

straight line segment through a point on it.

Step 3:   Name that perpendicular as RQ.

O

R

X

P

Q

RQ is the tangent drawn to the circle through X.

Construction of a tangent to a circle from an external point

Let O be the centre of the circle and A a point external to the circle. 

A

O

To construct this, let us use the theorem, “The tangents drawn to a circle from an 
external point (exterior) are equal in length.”

Step 1:  

Join OA. Construct the perpendicular bisector of the straight line segment 
OA. Name the point of intersection of OA and its perpendicular bisector 
as  B.  To  do  this  construction,  use  the  knowledge  on  constructing  the 
perpendicular bisector of a straight line segment.

Step 2:    Taking B as the centre and BO (or BA) as the radius, draw two arcs which

Step 4:   Draw the lines AP and AQ.

AP and AQ are the tangents drawn to the circle with centre O from the point A.

  and

 are 90o.

Next we will consider how to describe the nature of the elements that belong to a 
particular region in a Venn diagram in words. It is easier to understand this if we 
consider an example.

The following Venn diagram provides information on what a group of students like 
to drink.

E

C

H

F

D

Those who like coffee

The regions denoted by the capital letters of the English alphabet in the above Venn 
diagram can be described in words as follows.

A -  Those who like to drink tea, milk and coffee
B -  Those who like to drink only tea and milk.  That is, those who like to drink tea

 and milk but do not like to drink coffee
C -  Those who like to drink only tea and coffee
D -  Those who like to drink only milk and coffee
E -  Those who like to drink only tea
F -  Those who like to drink only milk
G -  Those who like to drink only coffee

H -  Those who do not like to drink any of these three

Moreover, regions that are obtained by combining two or more of the above regions 
can also be described in words, most often in a simple way. 

A and B – Those who like to drink tea and milk
B and C and D – Those who like to dring exactly two of these three types
A and B and C and D – Those who like to drink at least two of these three types
A and B and C and E – Those who like to drink tea
E and F and G – Those who like to drink exactly one of these three types

(iii) How many families do not own a bicycle?

     (iv) How many families own exactly two types of vehicles?
     (v)  How many families own at least two types of vehicles?
    (vi)  How many families own exactly one of these three types of vehicles?

 (i) The set of households which have cars is denoted by C. All these households 
need to be considered. Therefore, the number of households which have cars is 
20 + 8 + 10 + 15 = 53.

 (ii) The set of households that have motor cycles is denoted by M.  The households 
which have only motorcycles are those which have motorcycles but not cars 
or bicycles.  Therefore, to obtain the answer, from the households which have 
motorcycles, those which also have either cars or bicycles have to be removed. 
Hence, the number of households which have only motorcycles is 34.

(iii) The number of households which do not have bicycles is obtained by removing 
from  all  the  households  in  the  scheme,  those  which  have  bicycles.  In  other 
words, these households are those which have only cars, only motor cycles, 
only cars and motorcycles or those which do not have any of these three types 
of vehicles. This number is, 20 + 8 + 34 + 2 = 64

(iv) The households which have only two types of vehicles are those which have 
only cars and motorcycles or only cars and bicycles or only motorcycles and 
bicycles. This number is 15 + 8 + 11 = 34.

(v) The households which have at least two types of vehicles are those which have 
either  two  types  of  vehicles  or  all  three  types  of  vehicles.    This  number  is  
15 + 8 + 11 + 10 = 44.

(vi) The households which have only one type of vehicle are those which have only 
cars or only motorcycles or only bicycles. This number is 20 + 34 + 12 = 66.

  two stages using

(i) a grid (Cartesian plane)
(ii) a tree diagram

Do the following exercise to recall what had been learnt in Grade 10.

4. Three identical cards numbered from 1 to 3 are in a bag. One card is drawn out 
at random and the number on it is checked to see if it is odd or even, and then the 
card is replaced in the bag. A card is drawn out again at random from the bag and 
the number is similarly checked to see whether it is odd or even. 

   (i)  If the sample space is denoted by S, write S as a set and write down n(S).
   (ii)  If A is the event of both numbers drawn being even, write A as a set and 

write down n(A).
  (iii)  Hence find P (A)'
  (iv)   Represent S on a grid.
    (v)   If B is the event of drawing exactly one even number, then square the points 

 on the grid that belong to B and find P(B).   

(vi)   Represent S in a tree diagram and find the probability of drawing at least 

 one even number. 

25.1  Independent and Dependent Events

(i) Independent events

We learnt in Grade 10 that if the occurrence of an event does not depend on the 
occurrence of another event, then the two events are independent. If A and B are 
independent we know that P (A∩B) = P(A)P(B). An example of this is given below.  

Let us consider the random experiment of flipping two coins simultaneously and 
noting the sides that are face up. It is clear that the side which is face up on one 
coin has no influence on the side which is face up on the other coin. Therefore the 
side which is face up on one coin is independent of the side which is face up on the 
other coin.

(ii) Dependent events

If  the  occurrence  of  an  event  depends  on  the  occurrence  of  another  event,  then 
they are called dependent events. That is, the occurrence of one event changes the 
probability of the other event. 

Deepen your understanding on dependent events further by studying the following 
examples.

a.  The probability of a team winning a cricket match depends on whether the best 
bowler of the team plays in the match or not. Therefore the two events of the 
best bowler playing and the team winning are dependent events.

129

 
    
 
  
 
 
  
b.  An animal is selected at random from a cattle pound in which there are cows 
and bulls. If the selected animal is a cow, milk can be obtained from it and if it 
is a bull, then milk definitely cannot be obtained from it. Therefore the event of 
selecting a cow and the event of obtaining milk are dependent events.

c.  A bag contains 7 white balls and 3 black balls which are identical in size and 
shape. Let us consider the experiment of randomly drawing out a ball and noting 
its colour, and then, without replacing the first ball, randomly drawing out another 
ball, and noting its colour. As the first ball is not replaced before the second ball 
is drawn, the number of balls in the bag when the second one is drawn out is not 
10 but 9, and the number of balls of a particular colour remaining in the bag after 
the first ball is drawn depends on the colour of the first ball that is drawn. 

    The probability of the second ball being a white ball if the first ball   
      was white  

=  6
9

 =  2
3

    The probability of the second ball being a white ball if the first          =  7
9
      ball was not white

As these two probabilities are not equal, the probability of the second ball being 
white is dependent on the probability of the first ball being white.

25.2   Solving problems using a grid

When a random experiment occurs in two stages, the events of the two stages may 
be independent or dependent. In Grade 10 we learnt how to solve problems when 
the  events  of  the  two  stages  are  independent.  To  review  what  was  learnt,  let  us 
consider the following example.

Example 1  
In a bag there are 3 blue balls and 2 red balls of the same shape and size. A ball is 
randomly drawn out and the colour is noted. After replacing it, a ball is randomly 
drawn out again and its colour is also noted. 
 (i) Represent the sample space of this random experiment on a grid.
(ii) Find the probability of each of the following events using the grid.

(a) The first ball being red
(b) The second ball being red
(c) Both balls being red
(d) Both balls being the same colour
(e) At least one ball being red

130

   
 
 
 
 
 
 
(i)  We have learnt earlier that a grid can be used to solve problems on probability 
only if all the outcomes of the random experiment are equally likely. Since all 
the balls are equal in size and shape, the probability of a ball being drawn out 
is the same for all the balls. Therefore the sample space can be represented on a 
grid and the required probabilities can be found. Let us name the three blue balls 
B1, B2 and B3 and the two red balls R1 and R2.

First draw

The sample space consists of all the points that are marked by taking the horizontal 
axis to represent the outcomes of the first draw and the vertical axis to represent the 
outcomes of the second draw.

Since the second ball is taken out after replacing the first ball, the two events are 
independent of each other. 

The probability of an event is found using a grid, by dividing the number of points 
relevant to the given event by the total number of points in the sample space.

(ii)  The event of drawing a red ball on the first occasion is denoted by A on the grid. 
10 points from the sample space belong to A. The whole sample space consists 
of 25 points. 

 ... the probability of the first ball being red = 

number of points in A 
number of points in the  sample space

(b)  The event of the second ball being red is denoted by B on the grid. 

    = 10
25

 = 

2
5

Accordingly,

the  probability of the second ball being red   = 

number of points in B
number of points in the sample space

   = 10
25

 =

131

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(c)  The event of both balls being red is the set of points which are common to both 

A and B. There are 4 points in this set.

...  the probability of both balls being red  =  

number of points common to 
both A and B
number of points in the sample space

     =  4
25

(d) For both balls to be the same colour, they should both be blue or both be red. 
The set of points relevant to this event is denoted by C. There are 13 points in 
this set.

...  the probability of both balls being 
    the same colour

Now let us consider an example of a random experiment consisting of two stages, 
where the events are dependent.

Example 2

In Sithija’s pencil box there are 2 red pencils and 3 blue pencils of the same size and 
shape. Sithija randomly draws one pencil out and gives it to his friend Thamilini. 
Then Sithija randomly draws another pencil out for himself.

 (i) Write the sample space in terms of the outcomes and then represent it on a grid.
(ii) Find the probability of each of the following events using the grid.

(a) Drawing a red pencil for Thamilini
(b) Sithija drawing a red pencil for himself
(c) Both getting pencils of the same colour
(d) Only Thamilini getting a red pencil

(i) Let us name the three blue pencils B1, B2, B3 and the two red pencils R1, R2.The 
pencil given to Thamilini is one of R1, R2, B1, B2, B3 and the pencil Sithija drew for 
himself is also one of these. However since Sithija cannot have the pencil which

cannot  occur. Apart  from  these  5  points,  the  remaining  20  belong  to  the  sample 
space. Therefore the sample space is the set

25.3 Solving problems using tree diagrams

A tree diagram can be used to find the probabilities of events related to a random 
experiment  having  many  stages.  In  this  lesson  we  will  consider  only  random 
experiments  having  two  stages.  Let  us  study  this  by  considering  the  following 
examples.

In Grade 10 you learnt to find probabilities when the events were independent. Let 
us review what you learnt earlier.
Example 1  
In a bag there are two white balls and one black ball of the same size and shape. 
One ball is randomly drawn out and its colour is noted. After replacing it, a ball is 
randomly drawn out again and its colour is also noted. 
 (i) Represent the sample space of this random experiment in a tree diagram.
(ii) Find the probability of each of the following events using the tree diagram.

(a) Drawing a white ball on both occasions
(b) Drawing a white ball on the first occasion 
(c) Drawing only one white ball 
(d) Drawing at least one white ball

135

 
 
  
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
(i)  Let us denote the event of drawing a white ball by W and drawing a black ball 
by B. As the outcomes are equally likely, the probability of drawing a white ball

 . In that part of the

tree diagram which represents the first draw, let us indicate the probability of 
each of these two events on the relevant branches.

Note: The sum of the probabilities on the branches which originate from a single 

point is 1. This occurs at every stage.

Now let us extend the above tree diagram to indicate the probabilities of the second 
stage.

As  the  second  ball  is  drawn  out  after  replacing 
the first ball, the number of balls in the bag when 
the  second  ball  is  drawn  out  is  the  same  as  the 
number that was in the bag initially. Therefore the 
probabilities of drawing a white ball and drawing 
a black ball on the second occasion are the same 
as those on the first occasion. These probabilities 
are marked on the appropriate branches.
Notice  that  the  sum  of  the  probabilities  on  the 
branches that originate from a point, all add up to

As an example, (W,W ) represents the event of both balls drawn being white. Its 
 ' The reason why these two can be multiplied together 
probability is  
is because they are independent events. The four events (W, W), (W, B), (B, W) and
(B,  B)  are  mutually  exclusive  events.  The  reason  for  this  is  because,  no  two  of 
these four events can occur together. The required probabilities can be calculated 
as follows.  

(a)Probability of drawing a white ball on the first occasion and a white ball on the 
second occasion too   

= P (W, W)

Now let us consider an example where the events are dependent.

Example 2  
In a bag there are 3 red balls and 2 blue balls of the same size and shape. One ball 
is randomly drawn out and its colour is noted. Without replacing the first ball, a 
second ball is randomly drawn out and its colour too is noted. 

  (i) Represent the sample space in a tree diagram.
 (ii)   Using the tree diagram find the probability of each of the following events.

(a) Drawing a red ball on both occasions
(b) Drawing only one red ball
(c) Drawing at least one red ball

P (R) =

How the probabilities relevant to the second draw were found can be described as 
follows.

The probabilities on the branches in the second stage are different to those on the 
branches in the first stage. This is because the probabilities for the second stage 
have to be found after considering the first stage.

If the first ball drawn is red, then the bag will have 2 red balls and 2 blue balls 
remaining.
...  the probability of the second ball drawn being red =  2
4
  The probability of the second ball drawn being blue =  2
4

If the first ball drawn is blue, the bag will have 3 red balls and 1 blue ball remaining.
...  the probability of the second ball drawn being red   =  3
4
    The probability of the second ball drawn being blue =  1

Let us write these probabilities on the relevant branches of the tree diagram, and 
complete the given outcomes table. Establish that the sum of the probabilities along 
the four branches is 1.

In the table, the probability of the outcome (R, R) (drawing two red balls) has been 
found by multiplying the relevant probabilities. But these two probabilities are not 
independent. This is because the probability of drawing a red ball on the second 
occasion  depends  on  whether  or  not  a  red  ball  was  drawn  on  the  first  occasion. 
Here  however,  the  probability  of  drawing  a  red  ball  on  the  second  occasion  has 
been found by assuming that the first ball drawn is a red ball. Therefore to find the 
probability of (R, R), the two relevant probabilities can be multiplied. 

The events (R, R), (R, B), (B, R), (B, B) in the above table are mutually exclusive. 
Therefore to find the probability of a certain event using the tree diagram, we need 
to select the outcomes relevant to the event from the table and add the probabilities 
of these outcomes.

Foreword

With the continuous advancement of the world, the education sector too is 
transformed.  Therefore,  if  we  require  the  creation  of  a  student  community  who 
could  confront  the  future  challenges  successfully,  our  learning  teaching  process 
must constantly utilize effective approaches. It is our responsibility to disseminate 
the knowledge of the new world while assisting to create global citizens with good 
values.  Our  department  is  actively  engaged  in  producing  learning  tools  with  the 
great aim of contributing to enlighten the minds of the children of the country.

A  textbook  is  a  repository  of  knowledge. At  times,  it  takes  us  to  a  world 
of entertainment while developing our critical thinking faculties. It promotes our 
hidden  potentials.  In  the  coming  years,  the  memories  related  to  these  textbooks 
will bring you happiness. While making the maximum use of this valuable learning 
tool, you must essentially access other useful knowledge spaces too. I wish that you 
would gain the ability to enlighten the future as citizens with knowledge and values 
by using this textbook. 

I would like to bestow my sincere thanks on the panels of writers, editors and 
reviewers as well as on the staff of the Educational Publications Department for the 
contribution made on this endeavor.

Literature is the Book of Revelation. This was written to strengthen the faith of the 
Christians who had to undergo persecutions. This book was written in symbolic 
language. We know that even today many Christians have to face persecutions. 
Let us pray for them so that they may be faithful to their faith. Thereby let us help 
them. Let us also make a firm decision that we will never betray our faith. Let us 
be strengthened by the Word of God to do so.

The Book of Psalms

I lift up my eyes to the hills
    from where will my help come?
My help comes from the LORD,
    who made heaven and earth.

He will not let your foot be moved;
    he who keeps you will not slumber.
 He who keeps Israel
    will neither slumber nor sleep.

The LORD is your keeper;
    the LORD is your shade at your right hand.
The sun shall not strike you by day,
    nor the moon by night.

The LORD will keep you from all evil;
    he will keep your life.
The LORD will keep
    your going out and your coming in
    from this time on and forevermore.

(Psalms 121)

The  Book  of  Psalms  is  a  book  of  the  Holy  Bible  with  150  hymns.  Each  of 
them was sung, using a stringed musical instrument. They were sung with joy, 
praising God’s goodness. Yet, there are hymns, sung with sadness, lamentation or 
contrition. There are also hymns, sung during illness and bad experience. More 
than any other books of the Holy Bible, this book speaks about the experience of 
God in ordinary life. This book is known as “Book of Praises” and “Psalter.” It is 
the prayer book in the Holy Bible.

The  authorship  of  the  Psalter  is  attributed  to  King  David.  However,  all  do  not 
agree about King David’s authorship due to different language styles, its contents 
and time. The background of the book is the worship and homage, paid to God 
by the Israelites.

- Psalms 73-89
Third Book 
Fourth Book  - Psalms 90-106

Psalm 72:19
Psalm 89:52

Psalm 150

Classification of the Psalms

1. Hymns of Praise

These hymns speak about God’s creation and salvation and God’s features, such 
as goodness, mercy, love, greatness, royalty. E.g. Psalm 8, 112, 145-150.

O' LORD, our Sovereign,
  how  majestic  is  your  name  in  all 
the earth!
You have set your glory above the 
heavens.

          (Psalm 8:1)

2. Lament  Psalms

These hymns are called by this name, because they were sung during times of 
difficulties and distress, asking God’s help. These hymns can be divided into two:

8

i.  Personal Lament Psalms (Psalm 3, 5, 6, 7, 13, 140)
ii.  Communal Lament Psalms (Psalm 44, 74, 79, 80, 83)

9

 
 
 
 
 
 
I said unto the LORD, 
Thou art my God: 
hear the voice of my supplications, 
O' LORD.
O'  GOD  the  Lord,  the  strength  of  my 
salvation, 
thou  hast  covered  my  head  in  the  day  of 
battle.

      (Psalm 140:6-7)

3. Thanksgiving Psalms

They were sung with gratitude to God for the graces and benefits, received. E.g. 
Psalms 18, 105 and 116

O give thanks to the LORD, for he 
is good,
for  his  steadfast 
forever.

love  endures 

         (Psalm 136:1)

4. Wisdom Psalms

These psalms encourage the people to lead a righteous life. E.g. Psalms 1, 73 and 
133

Happy are those
    who do not follow the advice of the wicked,
or take the path that sinners tread,
    or sit in the seat of scoffers;
 but their delight is in the law of the LORD,
    and on his law they meditate day and night.

        (Psalm 1:1-2)

5. Royal Psalms

These  psalms  were  sung  during  the  consecration  or  weddings  of  kings.  E.g. 
Psalms 2, 45 and 72

9

8

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Give the king your justice, O' God,
and your righteousness to a king’s 
son.

          (Psalm 72:1)

6. Psalms of Zion

Zion is Jerusalem. These Psalms speak of the greatness of Jerusalem. They were 
used in pilgrimages to Jerusalem. E.g. Psalms 46, 48, 122 and 125

Those who trust in the LORD are 
like Mount Zion,
which  cannot  be  moved,  but 
abides forever.

      (Psalm 125:1)

7. Psalms of Trust

These speak of firm faith on God. Trusting in God, these Psalms were sung. E.g. 
Psalms 23, 62 and 71

Even though I walk through the darkest 
valley,
I fear no evil;
for you are with me;
your rod and your staff
they comfort me.

  (Psalm 23:4)

Psalter is a treasure of prayer. It is the best proof that the Israelites experienced 
God in their ordinary life. They brought all their life experience to God in prayer.

10

11

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Lord Jesus has quoted from Psalms. He used psalms in the Sermon on the Mount. 
E.g.  Psalm  6:9  (Matthew  7:23),  Psalm  24:3-4  (Matthew  5:8),  Psalm  37:11 
(Matthew 5:5). Lord Jesus used Psalm 22:1 on the cross.

In happiness and win, we praise God and in pain and distress, we appeal to God: 
we ask His help. When we fall into sin, we are contrite. We go back to God; ask 
pardon. We take all these to God in prayer, using psalms.

We use psalms in the Responsorial Psalms of the Holy Mass, the highest act of 
liturgy. In the Liturgy of the Hours and the Vespers, Palter is indispensible.

Therefore, the Psalter has being in use from ancient times to present day. It is a 
prayer book that helps to lift the heart of the faithful to God.

Activity

1.  Get a psalm of your choice from the Psalter and write it in your 

exercise book.

2.  Display a psalm on your Wallpaper.
3.  Write an essay of 100 words on the topic, “Psalter is our prayer 

book.” 

4.  Compose a hymn, praising God.

For Life

Synoptic Gospels

Sandali :  Mother, Rebecca of our class has written a beautiful poem about 
Lord  Jesus  and  it  is  in  the  Children’s  corner  of  the  Catholic 
Messenger. Look, it is very nice.

Mother :  What a good thing.

Sandali :  Mother,  I  too  like  to  know  about  Lord  Jesus.  I  want  to  know 
teachings of Lord Jesus, how He healed the sick, etc. 

Mother : 

If so, you have to read the Gospels. It is the best way to know about 
Lord Jesus.

Sandali :	 Will	I	be	able	to	finish	it?

Mother :	 Why	not?	First	read	the	synoptic	Gospels.

Sandali :	 What	do	you	mean	by	“Synoptic	Gospels?”	I	have	not	heard	such	

a word.

Mother :	 Well,	I	will	tell	you,	what	“Synoptic	Gospels”	are.

There are three synoptic Gospels. They are:

  1. The Gospel of St. Matthew
  2. The Gospel of St. Mark
  3. The Gospel of St. Luke

  St. Mark

12

St. Matthew

St. Luke

13

 
 
 
     
 
These Gospels are called by that name, because there are many similarities among 
them. These three evangelists present information about Lord Jesus in a more or 
less similar manner.

The  synoptic  Gospels  present  Lord  Jesus’  baptism  in  a  similar  manner. 
The following quotations testify to that fact:

And a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, the Beloved, with whom 
I	am	well	pleased.”	

(Matthew 3:17)

And a voice came from heaven, “You are my Son, the Beloved; with you 
I	am	well	pleased.”

(Mark 1:11)

And a voice came from heaven, “You are my Son, the Beloved; with you 
I	am	well	pleased.”

(Luke 3:22)

We	lernt	about	the	Gospel	of	St.	Luke	in	grade	eight.	From	this	lesson,	let's	learn	
about another two Gospels, St. Matthews and St. Mark.

The Gospel of St. Matthew

Author : 

St. Matthew, the apostle.

Time : 

80-90 A.D.

64-66 A.D.

Purpose :   

To strengthen the faith of the first 
Christians,  who  were  persecuted 
under the Roman emperor, Nero.

Other Names : The Gospel of Passion.

Picture 4.1 - St. Mark

In the same way, we should be courageous to witness to Lord Jesus Christ in the 
face of various challenges. We have to imitate St. Mark’s Christian community 
who were faithful to their faith in the face of persecutions, launched by the Roman 
emperor. Daily we must to respond to the challenges that come in our way.

God	has	given	us	so	many	talents.	For	them,	we	should	be	grateful	to	Him.	Like	
the evangelists, we should make use of our talents to spread the Good News.

Activity

The Gospel of St. John

Author : 

St. John, the apostle.

Time : 

90-100 A.D.

Purpose :     To prove that Lord Jesus is the Son of 
God and by believing in Him that you 
may have Eternal Life.

Other Names : The Spiritual Gospel. 

Picture 5.1 - St. John

1. “I am the bread of life” (John 6:35)

Lord Jesus is the real food that gives us the Eternal Life. He is really present in 
the Eucharist. Therefore, we have to receive the Eucharist with respect and love. 
When we receive the Eucharist regularly, our spiritual life is nourished.

2. “I am the light of the world.” (John 8:12)

It is clear from the Gospels how Lord Jesus became a light to all. Not only by 
word, but also by deed and life, He became a light. Where there is light, there is 
no place for darkness. To live in light, one has to be free from sin. We must try to 
be the children of light.

3. “I am the gate for the sheep.” (John 10:7)

We are the sheep of Lord Jesus, the shepherd. We have to enter the Eternal Life 
through Lord Jesus, the gate for the sheep.

15

PB

            
4. “I am the good shepherd.” (John 10:11)

The shepherd goes in front of the sheep and leads them. He does so in order to 
give the necessary protection and to lead in the necessary direction. As a good 
shepherd,  Lord  Jesus  Christ  guides  us.  We  have  to  be  His  obedient  and  good 
sheep.

Picture 5.2 - Good Shepherd

5. “I am the resurrection and the life. (John 11:25)

Lord Jesus not only gives life, but also gives us a life that cannot be conquered by 
death. Just as He overcame death and resurrected, he will raise us to Eternal Life. 
In view of the life after death, we have to lead a good life.

6. “I am the way, and the truth, and the life.” (John 14:6)

One who knows the way, knows the truth and has life can show the way, tell the 
truth and gives life to others. Lord Jesus knows the way which leads to God. He 
is the truth. If we believe in Him, we can attain Eternal Life. By going on the way 
(the doctrine), showed by Him, we can witness to the truth.

16

17

7. “I am the true vine.” (John 15:1)

If the branches of the vine to bear fruit, they have to get water and nourishment 
from the vine. Lord Jesus is the true vine. If we are to bear fruit, we have to be 
grafted to the vine. We have to be the branches of the true vine, Lord Jesus.

Fall of Man to Sin

Basuru is a good student in Grade 9, who loves God, the Father. He was being 
praised by all, because of his good qualities. They often advised others, saying: 
“Look at Basuru, he is a good student. You should be like him. You are a bad lot. 
You do not follow our instructions. You are senseless.” 

Some of the students, who were regularly blamed by the Principal and the teachers, 
decided to mislead Basuru. After school, on the way home, they showed beautiful 
scenes from the mobile telephone to Basuru. They compelled him to watch good 
scenes first and then bad scenes. Finally he got addicted to the mobile phones.

He not only failed at exams, but also he was despised by many. All abandoned 
him. Then he remembered the loving God, the Father. He met the Parish Priest 
and made a good confession. Having listened to his advice and got his blessings, 
he  decided  to  live  a  good  life.  He  made  a  firm  decision  not  to  do  any  wrong 
afterwards. 

³     ³     ³     ³     ³     ³     ³     ³     ³     ³

God, the Father settled Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden so that they may 
cultivate and look after it. He gave a commandment to live in that garden:

Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you 
shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you 
shall die.

        (Genesis 2:17)

This shows that He is a loving father and He gives us advice to lead a good life. 
He speaks to us especially through our conscience. Therefore, we should listen to 
the divine voice within us.

18

19

 
 
 
 
Picture 6.1 - Falling of Adam and Eve into sin

Man and woman lived in the Garden. They had enough food. They lived happily 
because they were in friendship with God. The serpent was cunning more than 
any other animal. It tempted the woman. It questioned from the woman whether 
God forbade eating any of the trees in the Garden. She said that they can eat from 
any tree except the tree in the middle and that if they ate, they would definitely 
die. Yet, the serpent said that they would not die, and instead their eyes would be 
opened and would see that they were equal to God, and would be able to know 
good and bad.

Having  listened  to  the  serpent’s  misleading  words,  she  thought  that  the  fruit 
would be tasty and would give intelligence. She ate some fruits and gave some to 
the husband and he too ate them.

This shows how Adam and Eve fell into sin. Even if we are not close to God, the 
Satan may tempt us as he tempted Adam and Eve. Especially we must listen to the 
conscience when we are tempted.  We have to overcome temptations. We have to 
follow Lord Jesus, who overcame temptations.

To the Serpent

To Eve

1.  Curse
2.  All through life creeping

1.  Increase pans in child bearing
2.  In pains brings forth children
3.  Though  desire  for  husband, 

he will rule over her

Punishments as 
consequences of 
sin
(Genesis 3:14-19

To Adam

1.  Cursing of the ground
2.  In toil he shall eat all the days of his life
3.  Thorns and thistles earth shall bring forth
4.  Eat the plants of the field
5.  By the sweat, he shall eat bread until he 
return to the ground, for out of it he was 
taken; he was dust, and to dust he would 
return.

God  punished  the  first  parents  not  out  of  anger  but  out  of  love.  We  have  to 
understand that when we do a wrong, even our parents punish us out of love.

20

21

Even though Adam and Eve were disobedient to God, God was merciful to them 
and  gave  a  promise  of  salvation.  God,  who  loved  the  fallen  man  unceasingly, 
promised  to  send  a  saviour  to  save  man  from  sin.  That  promise  is  found  in 
Genesis 3:15:

I will put enmity between you and the woman, and 
between your offspring and hers; he will strike your 
head, and you will strike his heel.

(Genesis 3:15)

In this promise, the offspring of the woman is humanity. The serpent is the Satan. 
There is an eternal enmity between man and the devil.

In the phrase “he will strike your head,” “he” means Lord Jesus, the Saviour of 
the world. God so loved the disobedient man that He promised to send a saviour 
to redeem man.

And  the  LORD  God  made  garments  of  skins

Cain and Abel

Picture 7.1 - Cain’s and Abel’s Offerings

Adam and Eve had two sons, namely Cain and Abel. Abel was a shepherd. Cain 
was a farmer. After some time, Cain made an offering to God out of the harvest 
that he made from the ground. Abel offered the firstlings of his flock. God accepted 
Abel and his offering, but not Cain and his offering. Therefore, Cain got angry 
and he was jealous of Abel. Hence, God advised Cain:

The  LORD  said  to  Cain,  “Why  are  you  angry,  and 
why  has  your  countenance  fallen?  If  you  do  well, 
will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, 
sin is lurking at the door; its desire is for you, but you 
must master it.

          (Genesis 4:6-7)

When Cain learnt that God was pleased with his brother, Abel, he was jealous and 
furious. When God learnt that Cain was full of evil and going astray, He advised 
Cain and instructed to do away his evil intentions and become a good person. If 
he tried to be good, God promised that He too would help him.

23

PB

 
 
 
 
When we do wrong, God advises us through various persons. Such persons are 
religious leaders, parents, teachers and elders. We must listen to those who guide 
us in the correct path.

Picture 7.2 - Cain has killed Abel

Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let us go out to the field.” 
And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his 
brother Abel, and killed him.

        (Genesis 4:8)

The act of killing Abel by Cain shows that man sinned against fraternal love. Full 
of jealousy, Cain went against fraternal love and killed his brother. As children 
of God, we have to live in fraternal love. We should not be jealous of others. We 
should be happy, when others make various achievements. We have to protect the 
lives of others.

God questioned Cain who fell into sin in spite of His advice:

God :  Where is your brother Abel?

Cain : 

I do not know; am I my brother’s keeper?

24

God :  What have you done? Listen; your brother’s blood is crying out to me   

 from the ground!

25

 
 
 
 
 
These are the punishments and the consequences of sin that Cain received:

1.  He became a cursed person
2.  Dispelled from the ground
3.  When he tilled the ground, it would no longer yield to him its strength.
4.  He would be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.

When Cain was questioned about Abel, he says that he was ignorant of him: “I 
do not know.” He lied. This shows that he has become stubborn as a result of sin. 
Even though man sins on the sly, it cannot be hidden from God. Even though God 
punished Cain, He showed mercy towards him. The following passage testifies 
to that:

Cain said to the LORD, “My punishment is greater than I 
can bear!  Today you have driven me away from the soil, 
and I shall be hidden from your face; I shall be a fugitive 
and  a  wanderer  on  the  earth,  and  anyone  who  meets  me 
may  kill  me.”    Then  the  LORD  said  to  him,  “Not  so! 
Whoever  kills  Cain  will  suffer  a  sevenfold  vengeance.” 
And  the  LORD  put  a  mark  on  Cain,  so  that  no  one  who 
came upon him would kill him.

     (Genesis 4:13-15)

According to the above Bible passage, the one, who kills Cain, will get a sevenfold 
punishment. This shows that even the life of the sinner belongs to God. We cannot 
take a life of an offender. We cannot judge others. The sign, put on Cain, was a 
sign of protection, but not of a punishment. This shows that the sinner, who prays 
to God, will receive God’s mercy. We should keep away from sin, i.e. jealousy, 
envy, murder, etc. We must live with fraternal love.

Flood and the Covenant 
with Noah

8.1 Picture - Noah’s Ark

Now the earth was corrupt in God’s sight, and the earth 
was  filled  with  violence. And  God  saw  the  earth,  and 
behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their 
way upon the earth.

(Genesis 6:11-12)

The  above  quotation  shows  that  the  cause  of  the  flood  was  the  wickedness  of 
man.  Due  to  sin,  God  was  sorry,  and  therefore,  He  was  going  to  punish  man. 
The pinnacle of the creation is the man and man’s sin has influenced the whole 
creation negatively. 

And  God  said  to  Noah,  “I  have  determined  to  make 
an end of all flesh; for the earth is filled with violence 
through  them;  behold,  I  will  destroy  them  with  the 
earth.

    (Genesis 6:13)

8.2 Picture - Noah with his sons

But  Noah  found  favor  in  the  eyes  of  the  LORD. 
…  Noah  was  a  righteous  man,  blameless  in  his 
generation;  Noah  walked  with  God. And  Noah  had 
three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

        (Genesis 6:8-10)

Although the sin increased and its destructive influence became the rule of the 
day, God made available new ways of redemption. Though God decided to destroy 
the creation, which was affected by sin, the act of choosing Noah, his family and 
the representatives of the animals shows His mercy. Thus, Noah is selected as a 
beginner of a new creation. He was chosen because of his goodness.

Just as Noah, we must live as righteous people. We must be sincere. Just as Noah, 
we have to live a righteous life. Then we will be at the disposal of God’s mercy.

8.3 Picture - Flood

 In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second 
month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that 
day all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and 
the windows of the heavens were opened.

(Genesis 7:11)

The promise, given to Noah was realized as it was said. Noah was safe from the 
flood.

From  the  Holy  Bible,  it  is  clear  that  because  of  Noah’s  great  qualities,  he  was 
favourable  in  the  sight  of  God  and  he  became  a  friend  of  God.  We  can  have 
the inspiration from the life of Noah how we are to live in order to receive God’s 
mercy.

And when the LORD smelled the pleasing odor, the 
LORD said in his heart, “I will never again curse the 
ground because of man, for the imagination of man’s 
heart is evil from his youth; neither will I ever again 
destroy every living creature as I have done.

(Genesis 8:21)

31

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
God  decided  not  to  destroy  the  whole  world  once  again  by  flood  and  gave  a 
promise. It is evident from the Bible quotation, below. The mercy of God is also 
evident. It is an affirmation that divine protection and providence will be available 
to the future generations.

I will remember my covenant that is between me and 
you  and  every  living  creature  of  all  flesh;  and  the 
waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all 
flesh.

(Genesis 9:15)

8.4 Picture - After the flood

 And God said, “This is the sign of the covenant which 
I make between me and you and every living creature 
that  is  with  you,  for  all  future  generations:  I  set  my 
bow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant 
between me and the earth.

        (Genesis 9:12-13)

30

God  made  a  covenant  with  the  whole  creation.  Sign  of  affirming  the  covenant 
was the “rainbow” (bow). It was a unilateral covenant.

31

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rainbow is a sign of the end of flood. So it is a sign of divine providence. In the 
Old Testament, rainbow was a sign of divine sympathy, mercy and love. God 
rebuilds the relationship with man by the promise of not destroying the world 
by flood. Rainbow was the external sign of the covenant with Noah. 

God  has  fulfilled  the  promises  of  covenant  with  Noah.  In  the  same  way,  we 
have to fulfill the promises, given to others in the home, school and the parish.

The Judges

After the redemption from slavery in Egypt, Israelites came to the Promised Land. 
After they settled there, they had to face many difficulties and oppression, brought 
about by other nations. To protect Israelites from various foreign invasions and 
influences, God sent Judges, who were war heroes. The Book of Judges has to say 
this about appointing of Judges (heroes):

Then  the  LORD  raised  up  judges,  who 
delivered them out of the power of those who 
plundered them.

(Judges 2:16)

The period of Israelite Judges was from 1200-1050 B.C. One of the characteristic 
of the Judges was that their rule was not for the whole of Israelites. Their duty was 
to gather the Israelites together and take the leadership in wars that were against 
Israelites.

Whenever the LORD raised up judges for them, the LORD 
was with the judge, and he delivered them from the hand 
of their enemies all the days of the judge; for the LORD 
would be moved to pity by their groaning because of those 
who  persecuted  and  oppressed  them.  But  whenever  the 
judge  died,  they  would  relapse  and  behave  worse  than 
their  ancestors,  following  other  gods,  worshipping  them 
and  bowing  down  to  them.  They  would  not  drop  any  of 
their practices or their stubborn ways.

      (Judges 2:18-19)

PB

Thus it is clear that they were appointed not only to protect Israelites but also to be 
with Israelites and to work for their salvation. There are twelve such war heroes 
in the Holy Bible. They are:

Deborah, the heroine

She  was  an  intelligent  woman.  During 
time,  a  Canaanite  king  harassed 
her 
the  Israelites.  Therefore, 
the  Israelites 
prayed  to  God.  According  to  the  advice 
of  Deborah,  Barak  led  an  army  of  ten 
thousand against the Canaanite army. When 
Canaanites  learnt  that  Barak  came  to  the 
Mount  Tabor,  they  were  ready  to  fight. 
Deborah encouraged Barak, the commander 
in  chief  of  Israelite  army  to  fight  against 
the  Canaanite  army.  Due  to  grace  of  God, 
The  Israelite  army  won  the  war.  Deborah 
explained  that  the  victory  is  not  of  the 
Israelite army but that of God. 

After  a  peace  period  of  forty  years, 
Israelites  had  to  undergo  persecutions 
from the Midianites as a punishment for 
their sins.  Since they prayed to God for 
deliverance, Gideon was called.

hereby commission you.

(Judges 6:12, 6:14)

Gideon  destroyed  all  the  alters,  made  by  the  Israelite  for  the  false  gods  and 
gathered  people  for  the  war  against  the  Midianites.  However,  he  limited  the 
army to 300 as directed by God. According to the advice of Gideon, the army 
went  to  the  Midian  camp,  and  broke  the  jars,  holding  in  their  left  hands  the 
torches, and in their right hands the trumpets to blow. The God set every man’s

The Kings

When Israelites had to face various challenges, they felt that they had to organize 
themselves under a powerful king. They also felt that there was a need of a leader, 
who could unite the isolated tribes and form a great nation. They informed this 
idea to Samuel, who was in his old age. They insisted that they need a king. At 
the beginning Samuel was against this request. However, because of the persistent 
request, God asked Samuel to appoint a king.

Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came 
to Samuel at Ramah, and said to him, “You are old and 
your sons do not follow in your ways; appoint for us, 
then, a king to govern us, like other nations.” But the 
thing  displeased  Samuel  when  they  said,  “Give  us  a 
king  to  govern  us.”  Samuel  prayed  to  the  LORD,  and 
the LORD said to Samuel, “Listen to the voice of the 
people  in  all  that  they  say  to  you;  for  they  have  not 
rejected you, but they have rejected me from being king 
over them. Just as they have done to me, from the day I 
brought them up out of Egypt to this day, forsaking me 
and serving other gods, so also they are doing to you. 
Now then, listen to their voice; only you shall solemnly 
warn  them,  and  show  them  the  ways  of  the  king  who 
shall reign over them.”

(1 Samuel 8:4-9)

38

39

 
 
 
 
 
King Saul

The first king of Israel was Saul. He was the 
son of Kish of the tribe of Benjamin. He had 
a unique personality and was young. He went 
in search of the donkeys, which had strayed. 
Meanwhile  he  met  Samuel  by  chance.  The 
following  passage  elaborates  the  anointing 
of Saul as king as instructed by God:

10.1 Picture - King Saul

Samuel took a vial of oil and poured it on his head, and kissed 
him;  he  said,  “The  LORD  has  anointed  you  ruler  over  his 
people Israel. You shall reign over the people of the LORD and 
you will save them from the hand of their enemies all around. 
Now this shall be the sign to you that the LORD has anointed 
you ruler over his heritage:

(1 Samuel 10:1)

On hearing that Nahash, the king of Ammonites was ready to make a treaty by 
gouging out everyone’s right eye, Soul united all the people of Judah to wage a 
war against Nahash. Saul won the war.

After that he had to face great challenges from the Philistines. Because of a shrewd 
act of Jonathan, the son of Saul, the army of Philistines was defeated. However, 
Saul had to fight with Philistines throughout his reign. Later on he established a 
great army.

As the first king, he defeated the enemies of Israelites. He pioneered in building a 
powerful kingdom by uniting the Israelites. Having fought with Philistines, Soul 
lost his life.

39

38

 
 
 
 
 
 
King David

Since  Saul  disobeyed  God,  God  ordered  Samuel 
to  appoint  a  new  king. As  guided  by  God,  Samuel 
went to Jesse’s house in Bethlehem. Jesse belonged 
to  the  tribe  of  Judah.  He  was  to  select  one  of  his 
sons. Looking at the eldest son, he thought he was 
the suitable person, but God said: “Do not look at his 
appearance  or  on  the  height  of  his  stature,  because 
I have rejected him; for the LORD does not see as 
mortals  see;  they  look  on  the  outward  appearance, 
but the LORD looks on the heart” (1 Samuel 16:7).

God instructed Samuel to anoint David:

10.2 Picture - King David

Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in 
the presence of his brothers; and the Spirit of the LORD 
came mightily upon David from that day onward.

(1 Samuel 16:13)

Saul’s army was fighting vehemently with Philistines. David’s three brothers were 
in the army. One day Jesse sent David to see how his brothers fare. The leader 
of the Philistines was Goliath, a giant. He challenged that one of the Israelites 
should fight with him. Only David accepted the challenge. In the name of God, 
he came forward to fight against this giant. He took only his staff and five smooth 
stones.

40

41

 
 
 
 
 
David  said  to  the  Philistine,  “You  come  to  me  with  sword  and 
spear and javelin; but I come to you in the name of the LORD 
of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.

(1 Samuel 17:45)

Having run toward the Philistine, David put his hand in his bag, took out a stone, 
slung it, and struck the Philistine on his forehead; the stone sank into his forehead, 
and he fell face down on the ground. David grasped the sword of the Philistine, 
drew it out of its sheath, and cut off his head. When the Philistines saw that their 
champion was dead, they fled. On that day they had a humiliating defeat.

Fall of David into sin

David  sent  someone  to  inquire  about  the  woman. 
It  was  reported,  “This  is  Bathsheba  daughter  of 
Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite.” So David sent 
messengers to get her.

(2 Samuel 11:3-4) 

He  had  an  illegal  affair  with  her.  When  she  conceived,  she  told  David:  “I  am 
pregnant.”

Nathan, the prophet explained his sin through a parable. He did it in a shrewd 
way and brought him back to the correct path. Just like Nathan, the prophet, we 
too must show the others the correct path and bring them back to the correct path.

David’s Contrition

David  said  to  Nathan,  “I  have  sinned  against  the 
LORD.” Nathan said to David, “Now the LORD has 
put away your sin; you shall not die.

       (2 Samuel 12:13)

40

41

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
David accepted his sin immediately, and said: “I have sinned against the LORD.” 
This  shows  that  he  understood  his  sin  and  had  contrition  for  his  sins.  He  was 
humble enough to ask pardon for his sin. Having a contrite heart, he composed 
Psalm 51. Turn to the Holy Bible and read and meditate on it. We also should be 
contrite for our sins and overcome them.

King Solomon

10.3 Picture - King Solomon

After David, his son, Solomon, was anointed as the king. At the beginning of his 
reign, he built a beautiful Temple for God in Jerusalem.

Now  the  word  of  the  LORD  came  to  Solomon,  “Concerning  this 
house  that  you  are  building,  if  you  will  walk  in  my  statutes,  obey 
my ordinances, and keep all my commandments by walking in them, 
then  I  will  establish  my  promise  with  you,  which  I  made  to  your 
father David. I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not 
forsake my people Israel.” So Solomon built the house, and finished 
it. 

      (1 Kings 6:11-14)

42

43

 
 
 
 
 
 
Jerusalem Temple was magnificent. It took seven years to build. After it was over, 
the king consecrated it solemnly.

Kings, Saul, David and Solomon united Israel. They ruled the country as its lead-
ers. We have been baptized and therefore we have to be exemplary leaders. When 
we fall into sin, we have to be contrite as King David. We must make a firm deci-
sion to overcome sin.

Righteous Life

11.1 Picture - Well rooted fruitful tree

Just like a tree which is well rooted to the ground, we too should be well rooted to 
a graceful life. Such a tree cannot be fallen by flood or cyclone. In the same way, 
well rooted graceful life cannot be destroyed by sin. Just like a tree that grows 
and bears fruits, if we live a righteous life, the graces that we receive bear fruit. 
All will benefit from such a life. Even if it is unprofitable, we are not reluctant to 
do away with sin. 

At any time we can be tempted. To avoid temptations, the holy Catholic Church 
explains to us the sinful occasions. Let us recognize them.

Original Sin

Original  sin  is  the  guilt  we  inherit  from  our 
first parents.

     (Catholic Family Catechism 217)

44

Original sin is remitted by the Sacrament of Baptism.

45

 
Actual Sin

Actual  sin  is  disobeying  God’s  command  by 
thought, word, action or omission, with full knowl-
edge and consent.

    (Catholic Family Catechism 217)

There are two kinds of actual sin, namely mortal sin and venial sin. Mortal sin is 
an offence against the law of God with full knowledge, consent in a grave matter.

1. Full Knowledge

The sins committed before seven years are not mortal sins, but venial sins.

2. Full Consent

        A sin, committed due to force of someone, is not a mortal sin but a venial sin.

3. Grave Matter

For an example, a lie told as a joke is not a grave matter, but lie told in a 
court of law is a grave matter. Though a lie is said as a joke, it is wrong, i.e. 
venial sin.

4. Law of God

i.e. it is a sin against the Ten Commandment. Coming to school late is not a 
breach of the Ten Commandments, but refraining from attending Holy Mass

One must avoid even venial sins. If one ignores fever, it may cause pneumonia 
and he may die. In the same way, if we take venial sins for granted, we may end 
up in a mortal sin, and as a result, our spiritual life may die. Sins are a result of 
capital sins. Capital sins are the source of many other sins and vices.  There are 
seven of them. If one is to get rid of them they have to develop the seven virtues, 
opposed to the capital sins. 

Capital sins

Virtues, that have to be developed 
to get rid of capital sins

1. Pride  (inordinate  self-esteem

Divine Grace

Grace is a gift of God, granted to us through the merits of 
Lord Jesus Christ for our salvation. 

     (Catholic Family Catechism 127)

Because of Divine Grace

 ³ It paves the life of the Christian to a new path.

 ³ The Person participates in divine life.

 ³ The person gets graces to get rid of cravings.

There are two kinds of grace:

Divine Grace

46

 ³ is 

Sanctifying grace
that 
the  gift  of  God 
sanctifies our souls making us 
children of God and entitling 
us into heaven

(Catholic Family Catechism128)

  Actual grace
 ³ is the divine assistance given 
to us each time to avoid evil 
or to do good

  (Catholic Family Catechism129)

47

  
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
To receive divine grace, we have to live a holy life. To live a holy life, we must 
be free from sin. For that the following can be done:

1. Prayer
2. Good Works
3. Receive Sacraments

By  living  a  holy  life,  we  can  experience  a  life  full  of  divine  grace.  Hence,  we 
must always try to live such a life. To live a righteous life, pray to the Holy Spirit 
asking His grace. Let us also help others to live righteous lives.

Conversion

Parable of the Lost Son

12.1 Picture - Lost Son, hugged by the Father 

Read: Luke 15:11-32

In  spite  of  father’s  love,  the  younger  son  demanded  and  got  his  share  of  the 
property from the father and left the father in search of happiness and well being, 
but in a short time, all what he had was over. He lost his friends, happiness and 
well being, that he had looked for. Even having nothing to eat, he experienced 
the negative effects of sin. Then he came to his senses and recalled the love and 
mercy of the father, and the happiness and well being of the servants with the 
father. He had a conversion. 

The son, who had left the father as a prince, returned home as a beggar. The father 
was  waiting  for  the  son’s  return  with  conversion.  Once  the  son  returned,  the 
father welcomed him in mercy. Having forgiven, the best robe was clothed; ring 
was put; and sandals were worn. Once again he was given the status of a prince.

This parable illustrates the love and mercy of God. It also invites us to be aware 
of  sinful  states;  have  a  conversion;  come  back  to  God;  get  forgiveness  and 
experience the divine love, mercy and wellbeing.

The Parable of the Lost Coin

What  woman  having  ten  silver  coins,  if  she  loses  one  of 
them,  does  not  light  a  lamp,  sweep  the  house,  and  search 
carefully until she finds it? When she has found it, she calls 
together  her  friends  and  neighbors,  saying,  ‘Rejoice  with 
me, for I have found the coin that I had lost.’ Just so, I tell 
you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over 
one sinner who repents.

(Luke 15:8-10)

This parable shows that a woman, who has ten silver coins and loses even one of 
them, does not take it for granted, but looks for the lost one and when it is found, 
she is very happy. In the same way, God invites us to give up sinful ways and to 
experience divine love. It also shows how God is happy about the one, who is 
contrite for his sins and who is converted from sin. Therefore, we too must get 
converted and convert others from sin.

We have to believe that there is a loving Father who does 
not  allow  us  to  suffer  by  falling  into  sin  and  keeping 
away from divine love, but instead He comes in search 
of us.

The Woman Caught in Adultery

Read: John 8:1-11

According to the Law of Moses, one who commits adultery was to be stoned to 
death. Lord Jesus forgave even such a woman. Moreover, He said to her: “from 
now on do not sin again.”

We have to understand the sins that we have committed up to now, to be contrite 
for them, make a firm resolution not to do them once again, make a good confes-
sion and get absolution from Lord Jesus.

St. Augustine

St. Augustine  was  born  in  Thagaste  (now Algeria) 
in North Africa on the 13th of November 354 A.D. 
His father was Patricius. He was not a Christian. His 
mother was Monica, a Catholic. She became a saint 
and  she  is  called,  St.  Monica.  St. Augustine  was  a 
good orator and a lecturer. He went astray due to his 
bad habits. 

His mother prayed to God with a firm faith for the 
conversion  of  her  son.  She  asked  the  assistance  of 
St. Ambrose in that endeavour. After a long time, he 
got converted because of¦

 ³ His mother’s prayers
 ³ St. Ambrose’s guidance

12.3 Picture - St. Augustine

He  was  baptised  at  the  age  of  33  on  an  Easter  Sunday  amidst  his  mother’s 
happiness and praising of God. At that moment, his mother said: “Dear son, the 
only wish that I had all through my life was that you become a Christian. God has 
given more than what I wished. Let God be praised!”

Evil  always  leads  us  to  wrong  path.  There  are  so  many  ways  that  lead  us  to 
temptations.  Even  the  modern  technology  tempts  us.  We  have  to  overcome 
temptations and free others also from temptations. For that, we must pray to the 
Holy Spirit. Let us follow the example, set by St. Monica.

Sacrament of Reconciliation

13.1 Picture - Receiving the Sacrament of Reconciliation

Discipline  yourselves,  keep  alert.  Like  a  roaring  lion  your 
adversary  the  devil  prowls  around,  looking  for  someone  to 
devour. Resist him, steadfast in your faith, for you know that 
your  brothers  and  sisters  in  all  the  world  are  undergoing  the 
same kinds of suffering. And after you have suffered for a little 
while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal 
glory in Christ,  will himself restore, support,  strengthen, and 
establish you. To him be the power forever and ever. Amen.

  (1 Peter 5:8-11)

PB

According to this Sacred Scripture passage, our enemy is the devil. Because of 
him, there is hardship. He can be overcome, if we live in firm faith. If we are to 
live in such a faith, we have to shun away from sin. For that, we have to receive 
the Sacrament of Confession, when we fall into sin. If not, we lose sanctifying 
grace. i.e. we will lose the right to enter the kingdom of God.

53

 
 
 
 
 
 
There are two kinds of punishments for our sins:

1. Eternal Punishment

2. Temporal Punishment

The Following passage enumerates the two kinds of punishment, and how a sinner 
can get rid of those punishments.

To  understand  this  doctrine  and  practice  of  the  Church,  it  is 
necessary to understand that sin has a double consequence. Grave 
sin  deprives  us  of  communion  with  God  and  therefore  makes 
us  incapable  of  eternal  life,  the  privation  of  which  is  called  the 
"eternal  punishment"  of  sin.  On  the  other  hand  every  sin,  even 
venial,  entails  an  unhealthy  attachment  to  creatures,  which  must 
be  purified  either  here  on  earth  or  after  death  in  the  state  called 
Purgatory.  This  purification  frees  one  from  what  is  called  the 
"temporal punishment" of sin. These two punishments must not be 
conceived of as a kind of vengeance inflicted by God from without, 
but as following from the very nature of sin. A conversion which 
proceeds from a fervent charity can attain the complete purification 
of the sinner in such a way that no punishment would remain.

(CCC 1472)

The Lord is not slow about his promise, as 
some think of slowness, but is patient with 
you,  not  wanting  any  to  perish,  but  all  to 
come to repentance.

(1 Peter 3:9)

One  should  not  be  slow  to  ask  pardon  from  God  for  the  wrongs  that  he  has 
done. One should be contrite for his sins and get rid of the sinfulness. Only then 
everyone can enter the Kingdom of Heaven. The above Biblical quotation shows 
that God has given time to repent for one’s sins. 

54

55

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To get rid of Eternal Punishment

The one who has committed a mortal sin has only one means to get rid of Eternal 
Punishment,  i.e.  the  Confession  (Sacrament  of  Reconciliation).  Thus  says  the 
teaching of the Catholic Church on this:

The  forgiveness  of  sin  and  restoration  of  communion 
with God entail the remission of the eternal punishment 
of  sin,  but  temporal  punishment  of  sin  remains.  While 
patiently  bearing  sufferings  and  trials  of  all  kinds  and, 
when the day comes, serenely facing death, the Christian 
must strive to accept this temporal punishment of sin as a 
grace. He should strive by works of mercy and charity, as 
well as by prayer and the various practices of penance, to 
put off completely the "old man" and to put on the "new 
man."

(CCC 1473)

The  Sacrament  of  Reconciliation  makes  it  possible  for  one  to  enter  the 
Kingdom of God. Thereby one can get freed from the eternal punishment. 

Even though one gets rid of eternal punishment, he has to pay compensation 
for  his  sins.  Paying  compensation  for  the  sins  that  one  has  committed  is 
called “Temporal punishment.”

If one comments a mortal sin, he has to make a confession immediately. 
Thus says the “Catholic Family Catechism” about it.

If we commit a mortal sin, we should immediately 
makes an act of contrition and confess our sins 
to a priest at the earliest. 

(Catholic Family Catechism 248)

54

55

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Even though we have not committed a mortal sin, it is good to make confession 
now and then. Thereby we receive absolution for our sins and get the strength to 
keep away from sins.

To  get  absolution  for  our  sins  through  the  Sacrament  of 
Reconciliation

1.  First,  pray  asking  divine  grace  to  make  a  good  confession.  Make  an 
examination of conscience, by pondering on each of the Ten Commandments 
and the precept of the Church.

2.  Have sorrow for going against the divine love and reject the wrongs, done.

3.  Make a firm desire not to sin again.

4.  Confess all the sins without hiding any.

5.  Fulfil the punishments, given by the priest.

Rite of Confession
 ³ Sign of the Cross

 ³ “Bless me father, for I have sinned.”

 ³ Tell the last date of confession

 ³ Tell each of the sins in detail with the number of occasions from the last date 

of confession

 ³ “This is all I can remember. I am sorry for these and all my sins.” 

 ³ Listen to the priest attentively. Welcome the advice and punishments, given 

by him.

 ³ When the priest says the prayer of absolution, say the “Act of Contrition”

 ³ The sign of the cross

 ³ “God bless you!”

Your duty towards others

Having understood the necessity of confession and received it whenever necessary, 
we  have  to  lead  others  also  to  receive  the  Sacrament.  Make  others  realize  the 
damage, done by the sin and as a result going away from divine love. Let you 
teach others the rite of confessing, if they have forgotten. Let you guide others to 
go to confession. You may guide others to live a life of grace, free from Eternal 
and Temporal punishments.

Sacrament of the 
Anointing of the sick

14.1 Picture - The Anointing of the Sick

Since  Lord  Jesus  is  the  divine  healer,  He  can  not  only  heal  the  sick  but  also 
forgive the sins. He gave that power to the apostles: “Cure the sick,” (Matthew 
10:8). His apostles practiced that power later on. The following passage testifies 
to that:

Are any among you sick? They should call for the 
elders of the church and have them pray over them, 
anointing  them  with  oil  in  the  name  of  the  Lord. 
The prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord 
will raise them up; and anyone who has committed 
sins will be forgiven.

      (James 5:14-15)

58

According to the teachings of the apostles, the anointing of the sick is done by the 
priests. With regard to the Anointing of the sick, “Catholic Family Catechism” 
says:

59

 
 
 
 
The  Sacrament  which  confers  spiritual  strength  and 
physical  strength  to  a  person  who  is  seriously  sick  is 
the Sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick.

This Sacrament of the Anointing of the sick was earlier 
more  commonly  called  the  Sacrament  of  the  Extreme 
Unction  because  it  was  conferred  on  persons  who 
were  critically  sick  and  often  happened  to  be  the  last 
anointing in person’s life. 

However, it is wrong to believe that this Sacrament is 
conferred  only  when  a  person  is  in  danger  of  death. 
This Sacrament has also healing power and causes the 
recovery of the sick.

(Catholic Family Catechism 267)

Those who are eligible to receive the Sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick

 ³ Those who are in danger of death due to their old age or sicknesses

 ³ Those who are to undergo critical surgery

 ³ Those who are not in danger of death but can die in a short time

Each  time  a  Christian  falls  seriously  ill,  he  may 
receive the Anointing of the Sick, and also when, 
after he has received it, the illness worsens.

 (CCC1529)

58

59

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Special Graces and Effects of the Sacrament of the Anointing 
of the Sick (CCC 1532)

 ¡ The uniting of the sick person to the passion of Christ, for his own good and 

that of the whole Church; 

 ¡ The  strengthening,  peace,  and  courage  to  endure  in  a  Christian  manner  the 

sufferings of illness or old age; 

 ¡ The forgiveness of sins, if the sick person was not able to obtain it through the 

Sacrament of Penance; 

 ¡ The restoration of health, if it is conducive to the salvation of his soul; 
 ¡ The preparation for passing over to eternal life.

This Sacrament has to be conferred to  the person  in  need so that  he may have 
these  graces.  For  that  the  priest  has  to  be  called.  Before  the  priest  comes,  the 
place and the person have to be prepared.

Things that are to be prepared, before the priest arrives
 ³ Having laid a cloth on a table, cross and a lamp have to be kept on it
 ³ A serviette / towel, a basin of water, cake of soap, etc. have to be ready
 ³ Clean the sick person and the place as much as possible

Having made the sick person understand that the anointing of the Sick is not for 
the dying but for the sick, he is to prepare physically and spiritually to receive 
the Sacrament. This should not alarm the sick person and therefore, his fear has 
to be eliminated.

Do  not  wait  till  a  patient  is  critically  ill  to 
confer the Sacrament

Let  us  look  after  the  sick.  Do  not  think  that  it  is  a  burden.  We  know  that  the 
Anointing of the Sick grants many graces. As children of God, let us prepare the 
sick  in  advance  to  receive  the  Sacrament  without  waiting  till  the  last  moment. 
Let us recognize those in need of this Sacrament and make it known to the parish 
priest.

The Rite of the Anointing 
of the Sick

15.1 Picture - The Anointing of the Sick

Before anointing the sick person, the priest may hear the confession of the sick 
person.

INTRODUCTORY RITES

Having worn the surplice and the stole, the priest greets the sick person and those 
who  are  present  by  saying:  “The  peace  of  the  Lord  be  with  you  always.” The 
priest sprinkles the sick person and those present with holy water, saying: “Let 
this water call to mind our baptism into Christ, who by his death and resurrection 
has redeemed us.” Then he addresses those present in these or similar words:

Priest    : 

62

My dear friends, we are gathered here in the name of our Lord 
Jesus Christ who is present among us.  As the gospels relate, the 
sick  came  to  him  for  healing;  moreover,  he  loves  us  so  much 
that  he  died  for  our  sake.    Through  the  apostle  James,  he  has 
commanded  us:  “Are  there  any  who  are  sick  among  you?    Let 
them send for the priests of the Church, and let the priests pray 
over them, anointing them with oil in the name of the Lord; and 
the prayer of faith will save the sick persons, and the Lord will 
raise them up; and if they have committed any sins, their sins will 

63

be forgiven them.” Let us therefore commend our sick brother/
sister (Name of the person) to the grace and power of Christ, that 
he may save him/her and raise him/her up.

PENITENTIAL RITE

After the Lord’s Prayer, the priest shows the Eucharistic Bread to those present, 
saying: “This is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world. Come to 
me all you that labour and are burdened and I will refresh you.”  The people give 

65

 
 
the respective response. The sick person and all who are to receive communion 
say do so.

The priest says the concluding prayer. 

Priest  : 

Let us pray. 
All-powerful  and  ever-living  God  May  the  Body  and  Blood  of 
Christ your Son be for our brother/sister (Name of the person) a 
lasting remedy for body and soul. We ask this through Christ our 
Lord. 

Response : 

Amen.

BLESSING

Priest  : 

May almighty God bless you, the Father, and the Son, + and the 
Holy Spirit.

Response : 

Amen.

When the priest comes to anoint a sick person, we must assist him, pray for the 
sick person and pray loud enough so that the sick person may hear.

About the viaticum, the Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches:

In  addition  to  the  Anointing  of  the  Sick,  the  Church  offers 
those  who  are  about  to  leave  this  life  the  Eucharist  as  viaticum. 
Communion  in  the  body  and  blood  of  Christ,  received  at  this 
moment of "passing over" to the Father, has a particular significance 
and  importance.  It  is  the  seed  of  eternal  life  and  the  power  of 
resurrection, according to the words of the Lord: "He who eats my 
flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at 
the last day." The sacrament of Christ once dead and now risen, the 
Eucharist is here the sacrament of passing over from death to life, 
from this world to the Father.

(CCC 1524)

66

67

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Thus,  just  as  the  sacraments  of  Baptism,  Confirmation,  and 
the Eucharist form a unity called "the sacraments of Christian 
initiation,  "  so  too  it  can  be  said  that  Penance,  the Anointing 
of  the  Sick  and  the  Eucharist  as  viaticum  constitute  at  the 
end  of  Christian  life  "the  sacraments  that  prepare  for  our 
heavenly homeland" or the sacraments that complete the earthly 
pilgrimage.

             (CCC 1525)

Life is a precious gift

Think of the above headlines.

 Life is invaluable. It is a gift of God. Each person is born of parents as a result of 
divine mercy. Our life belongs to God.

One, who is alive today,
 may die tomorrow. 
No one can prolong his life by his 
own effort.

Human  life  is  sacred  because  from  its  beginning  it 
involves the creative action of God and it remains forever 
in a special relationship with the Creator, who is its sole 
end.  God  alone  is  the  Lord  of  life  from  its  beginning 
until its end: no one can under any circumstance claim 
for  himself  the  right  directly  to  destroy  an  innocent 
human being.

   (CCC 2258)

“Our lives are Temples of the Holy Spirit.” Therefore, we must take care to live 
a life in keeping with its sacredness. We must live a life, pleasing to God and we 
must be careful about our health. It is because our life is a gift and it belongs to 
God.

 Since it belongs to God, we must pay a just attention to it.

The use of drugs inflicts very grave damage on human 
health and life. Their use, except on strictly therapeutic 
grounds,  is  a  grave  offense.  Clandestine  production 
of  and  trafficking  in  drugs  are  scandalous  practices. 
They  constitute  direct  co-operation  in  evil,  since  they 
encourage  people  to  practices  gravely  contrary  to  the 
moral law.

(CCC 2291)

Because of liquor and smoke, one gets sick. Diseases, such as cancer is a result 
of them.

Life is a gift of God
Let us use our talents in the service of people.

Suicide

Everyone is responsible for his life before God who has given 
it to him. It is God who remains the sovereign Master of life. 
We are obliged to accept life gratefully and preserve it for 
his  honor  and  the  salvation  of  our  souls. We  are  stewards, 
not owners, of the life God has entrusted to us. It is not ours 
to dispose of.

(CCC 2280)

If one tries to commit suicide, it is an effort to grab a right of God. It is a mortal 
sin.

The  one  who  gave  me  life  is 
God.  My  life  depends  on  him. 
So let us pray to Him so that He 
may protect my life.

Since life is a gift of God, it is our duty to take medicine when we get ill and 
to be careful of our health. We must be careful when we eat and drink, because 
sicknesses are a result of wrong habits of eating. If one eats food with too much 
of sugar, salt or fat, he may get sicknesses, such as blood pressure, diabetics, heart 
attacks and he may die soon. We have to protect the precious life, given by God. 
We need exercise for our body. If we maintain our health, we can protect the life, 
given by God.

Protecting the Lives of 
Others

Chorus:
Love it was that made us
And it was love that saved us
Love was God’s plan, when He made man
Whose divine nature is Love.
Born of God’s love we must love Him
That’s why He made us to love Him.
But only when we love all men
Can we partake of God’s love.
But only when we love all men
Can we partake of God’s love.

Love is a wonderful thing
Joy in our hearts it will bring,
Where there’s true love there is God,
And where there’s God there is Love.

Christ said: Love must be a sign
By which men will know you are mine,
A new commandment I give,
Each other love as I did. 

Sing the above hymn meditatively and reflect the meaning of it.

Respecting Human Life

Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain a tiller of the ground. In 
the course of time Cain brought to the LORD an offering of the 
fruit of the ground, and Abel for his part brought of the firstlings 
of  his  flock,  their  fat  portions. And  the  LORD  had  regard  for 
Abel and his offering,  but for Cain  and his  offering he  had  no 

72

73

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
regard.  So Abel  was  a  keeper  of  sheep,  and  Cain  a  tiller  of 
the ground. In the course of time Cain brought to the LORD 
an  offering  of  the  fruit  of  the  ground,  and Abel  for  his  part 
brought  of  the  firstlings  of  his  flock,  their  fat  portions. And 
the LORD had regard for Abel and his offering, but for Cain 
and  his  offering  he  had  no  regard.  So  Cain  was  very  angry, 
and his countenance fell. The LORD said to Cain, “Why are 
you  angry,  and  why  has  your  countenance  fallen?  If  you  do 
well,  will  you  not  be  accepted? And  if  you  do  not  do  well, 
sin is lurking at the door; its desire is for you, but you must 
master it.” Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let us go out to the 
field.” And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against 
his brother Abel, and killed him.

(Genesis 4:2-8)

The offering of Abel was pleasing to God. As a result of that, it was accepted by 
God. If our offerings are to be pleasing to God, we should offer the best. For an 
example, we should offer the best time to God by praying, i.e. as soon as we get 
up daily.  

Cain  was  jealous  of  Abel,  because  Cain’s  offering  was  not  accepted.  Though 
jealousy is a small thing, it led him to the point of killing of his own brother, Abel.

Jealousy is a Capital sin. It is considered as a Capital sin because it may lead a 
person to commit a mortal sin. Therefore, we should get rid of even Capital sins. 
It is obvious that jealousy led to the point of revenge in the case of Cain and Abel 
story.

If one takes revenge, it deprives him of respecting others. Therefore, we should 
shun away from revenge. Even Lord Jesus taught that we have to love all without 
taking revenge. 

If  we  live  according  to  the  hymn,  found  at  the  beginning  of  the  lesson,  we 
can respect the lives of others.

Abortion

Picture 17.1: A child in mother’s womb

Picture 17.2 - A child at its birth

Look at the pictures attentively. Having kept a child in her womb for ten months, 
a mother gives birth to a child. Therefore, you have to be grateful to your mother 
and father. They have been looking after you since your conception to this moment. 

Life begins not at birth but at the conception. The following Holy Bible passages 
show that the life belong to God from the moment of conception:

74

75

Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, 
and before you were born I consecrated you;

    (Jeremiah 1:5)

My frame was not hidden from you, when I 
was being made in secret,

      (Psalms 139:15) 

If the life in mother’s womb belongs to God, we have no right to kill even a child 
in a mother’s womb. It is  morally wrong. The sin, committed by Cain, is also 
done  by  the  one  who  aborts.  In  abortion,  the  child  in  mother’s  womb  is  more 
innocent and helpless than Abel. It is a murder of a person who cannot protect 
himself. About this, thus says the Catechism of the Catholic Church:

Abortion  is  gravely  contrary  to  the  moral 
law:

(CCC 2271)

Do Not Murder

The Holy Church teaches that we should not only abort but also should not kill 
anybody.

Scripture  specifies  the  prohibition  contained  in  the  fifth 
commandment: "Do not slay the innocent and the righteous. 
"The  deliberate  murder  of  an  innocent  person  is  gravely 
contrary  to  the  dignity  of  the  human  being,  to  the  golden 
rule, and to the holiness of the Creator. The law forbidding 
it is universally valid: it obliges each and everyone, always 
and everywhere.

 (CCC 2261)

74

75

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
From the words, said to Cain, it is clear that not only the innocent, but also the 
offenders cannot be killed:

Then the LORD said to him, “Not so! Whoever kills 
Cain  will  suffer  a  sevenfold  vengeance.”  And  the 
LORD put a mark on Cain, so that no one who came 
upon him would kill him.

(Genesis 4:15)

Lord Jesus recalled the Fifth Commandment at the Sermon on the Mount:

You have heard that it was said to those of ancient times, 
‘‘You shall not murder’’; and ‘‘whoever murders shall be 
liable to judgment.’’ But I say to you that if you are angry 
with a brother or sister, you will be liable to judgment; and 
if  you  insult  a  brother  or  sister,  you  will  be  liable  to  the 
council;  and  if  you  say,  ‘You  fool,’  you  will  be  liable  to 
the fire of hell.

(Matthew 5:21-22)

Lord Jesus instructs that we should live amicably with our neighbour. Thus, it is 
clear that we ought to protect the lives of others.

Anger, vengeance, revenge, etc. are against fraternal love. Lord Jesus taught that 
we should not take revenge: “if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the 
other also.”

As children of God, our behaviour should be great. As children of divine Father, we 
must love our neighbours. Fraternal love is one of the characteristic of Christian 
life. Thereby, the lives of others are protected. Since all are created in the image 
and likeness of God, all of us are children of God.

Do Not Commit Adultery

Picture 18.1 - The Sinful Woman

The sacredness of the man, created in the image and likeness of God, rests on 
the relationship between man and woman. Lord Jesus showed that it was sacred. 
Therefore,  He  did  his  first  miracle  at  the Wedding  Feast  in  Cana. A  man  shall 
leave his father and his mother, and be joined to his wife; and they shall become 
one flesh.

Matrimony is a sacrament. It is the teaching of the Church that the husband and 
wife  join  together  for  a  higher  cause  at  marriage.  It  is  not  a  playful  life.  One 
should not marry in order to fulfill his lust.  One who has sexual relationships 
outside marriage, sacrileges the sacredness of the marriage.

The  best  fruit  of  love  is  marriage.  In  the  modern  world,  the  sacredness  of 
marriage is tarnished, but the Catholics should try their best to protect its beauty. 
Therefore, there should not be any illegal affairs before or after marriage. 

We should be holy in our word, deed and the way we look at others. We should 
avoid  pornography,  i.e.  reading  pornographic  books,  looking  at  pornographic 
pictures and films.

78

I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with 
lust  has  already  committed  adultery  with  her  in  his 
heart.

You shall not Covet 
Your Neighbour’s Wife

Man is created with body and soul. There is a constant struggle between body and 
soul. This struggle is a result of sin. We need the strength and power of the Holy 
Spirit to overcome temptations. 

If an idea or thought of sin comes to mind, it is not a sin. If such a thing lingers 
in our mind without our consent, it is also not a sin. It becomes a sin, when we 
entertain it with our consent. 

Purity requires modesty, an  integral part of temperance. 
Modesty  protects  the  intimate  center  of  the  person.  It 
means refusing to unveil what should remain hidden. It is 
ordered to chastity to whose sensitivity it bears witness. 
It  guides  how  one  looks  at  others  and  behaves  toward 
them in conformity with the dignity of persons and their 
solidarity.

(CCC 2521)

Man  with  a  pure  heart  does  a  great  service  to  the  society.  One,  who  listens  to 
God, has pure thoughts. We can get converted from evil thoughts by contrition. 
By making our thoughts pure, we can live in accordance with our human dignity.

You shall not covet your neighbour’s wife.
(Exodus 20:1)

Carnal concupiscence is an intense form of human desire. To have illegal affairs 
with the married is against this commandment. 

The Ninth Commandment warns against lust or carnal concupiscence. It advises 
us to refrain from all kinds of deeds and thoughts which destroy the purity of the 
family life. 

King  David  sinned  against  this  commandment  by  having  an  illegal  affair  with 
Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah. Since it displeased God, King David was punished. 
Herod Antipas committed the same sin by marrying his brother’s wife. St. John 
the Baptist showed his fault.

Exemplary Lives

St. Maria Goretti

She  was  born  on  the  16th  of  October  1890. 
She  lived  with  her  parents  in  a  small  town, 
called,  Corinaldo  in  Italy.  Her  parents  were 
Luigi  Goretti  and  Assunta  Carlini.  She  was 
the third in a family of seven.

Though  her  family  was  poor,  they  lived 
happily and closer to God and Mother Mary. 
When  she  was  six  years  old,  they  shifted 
to Paliano. After the death of the father, with 
mother  she  undertook  the  responsibilities 
of  the  family. With  brothers  and  sisters,  she 

Picture 20.1 - St. Maria Goretti

lived  a  life  pleasing  to  God.  One  day  when  nobody  was  at  home, Alessandro 
came and tried to persuade her to commit sin against the 6th commandment. She 
did not give in. Therefore, he stabbed her. Before her death, she told her mother: 
“Mother, I gave a promise on the day of my First Communion, i.e. I will not get 
destroyed my divine life even if I have to die. I have kept that promise.” Just like 
Lord Jesus forgave those who crucified her, St. Maria Goretti forgave Alessandro, 
the one who stabbed her.

When she died, she was 12 years old. She is a saint today. Her feast is celebrated 
on the 6th of July. 

Just like St. Maria Goretti, we have to protect our character. We must pray that 
God may help us to protect our divine life and we may live faithfully to Him. Let 
us ask the mediation of St. Maria Goretti to live like her.

St. Agnes

She  had  a  deep  faith  in  God  and  lived  a 
chaste  life  from  her  childhood.  On  the  day 
of her 12th birthday, she went to mass with 
her parents and received Communion. After 
the  mass,  she  met  the  Bishop  and  told  him 
that  she  would  live  as  a  virgin  throughout 
her life and dedicate her life to Lord Jesus. 
On the same evening the son of the governor 
sent her a gift with the intention of marrying 
her. She rejected the gift saying that she has 
married  to  the  Son  of  the  Heavenly  King, 
Lord  Jesus.  On  hearing  this,  he  got  angry 
and  ordered  to  arrest  her.  Soldiers  put  her 
in jail. She was forced to offer flowers and 
incense  to  statues  of  gods  and  goddesses. 
She  continued  to  pray  to  God  in  firm  faith 
without obeying the wicked. The son of the 
governor  came  and  promised  to  deliver  her 
from  all  persecutions,  if  she  consented  to  marry  him.  She  told  him  that  she 
belonged to Lord Jesus Christ, her saviour. On hearing this, he got angry and 
ordered to kill her. 

Picture 20.2 - St. Agnes

St. Dominic Savio

He was born on the 02nd of April 1842 in the village of Riva, northern Italy. His 
parents were Charles and Bridget Savio. He spent his early life at home. He was 

blessed with God’s graces. 

Dominic  Savio  requested  to  give  him  First 
Communion  at  the  age  of  seven.  This  was 
not  the  practice  in  the  Church  of  Italy  at 
that time. Normally, children received their 
first  holy  communion  at  the  age  of  twelve. 
Dominic's  Parish  Priest  was  so  impressed 
with  his  intelligence  concerning  the  faith, 
his  love  for  the  Lord  and  his  piety  that  he 
made  an  exception.  He  said  to  Dominic 
Savio:  “I  will  give  you  a  beautiful  gift  on 
Easter Sunday. On that day I will give First 
Communion  to  you.”  It  was  a  happy  news 
to  Dominic  Savio.  He  informed  this  to  his 
parents. From that time onwards, he received 
Communion regularly with devotion.

Picture 20.3 - St. Dominic Savio

He gave the example in words and deeds to those in school to live good Christian 
lives.  He  fell  ill  desperately.  Dominic  was  sent  home  to  recover  from  his  ill 
health. At home he spent a saintly life of prayer.

He died on the 09th of March 1857. When he was nearing his death he saw a 
wonderful vision and said: “Oh, what wonderful things I see”

Saint Dominic is the patron saint of choirboys, the falsely accused, and juvenile 
delinquents. His green scapular has helped many pregnant women to give birth 
to children without pain. The feast of St. Dominic Savio is celebrated on the 
10th of March.

Anthony : 

Father, I did not get any job for three months. I do not know how 
to meet the day-to-day expenses of the family.

Parish Priest :  You are a devout Catholic. You pray to God daily. You have a

He asked to pray continuously without losing faith. 

Ana Maria : 

Look, one of the pastors of a fundamentalist sect told me that he 
would give me one hundred thousand rupees, if we come to their 
sect abandoning Catholic faith. But I said to him that we serve 
one only one God and therefore we will not be apostates even if 
we have to die of hunger.

Having  gone  with  those  who  feed  themselves  by  selling  their 
religion, we cannot go to hell. We have to trust in God. Let us 
pray continuously. We will not miss the bus.

and gave him some money)

Anthony  :

hundred thousand rupees. Since I prayed to God fervently and 
continuously,	 I	 got	 a	 job	 to	 fulfil	 the	 needs	 of	 my	 children.	
Thanks be to God.

Prayer of Prophet Elijah

Prophet Elijah made an altar on the Mount Carmel. Prophet Elijah and the prophets 
of Baal arrange two burnt offerings separately. It was decided that the true God 
will	send	a	fire	and	burn	the	offering.	Although	the	prophets	of	Baal	prayed,	their	
offering	 was	 not	 burnt	 by	 a	 fire.	 Having	 poured	 water	 on	 the	 offering,	 Prophet	
Elijah prayed in this manner:

“O  LORD,  God  of  Abraham,  Isaac,  and  Israel,  let  it 
be  known  this  day  that  you  are  God  in  Israel,  that  I  am 
your servant, and that I have done all these things at your 
bidding.  Answer  me,  O  LORD,  answer  me,  so  that  this 
people may know that you, O LORD, are God, and that you 
have	turned	their	hearts	back.”	Then	the	fire	of	the	LORD	
fell and consumed the burnt offering, the wood, the stones, 
and the dust, and even licked up the water that was in the 
trench. 

(1 Kings 18:36-38)

(By this act, it was proved who the true God was)

At  the  end  of  the  offering  on  the  Mount  Carmel,  the  drought  was  over  and  it 
started to rain.  God protects those who believe in  Him.  In  addition  to  that,  He 
helps them in their needs. Therefore, we also should pray with faith in times of 
difficulties.

Rain as a Result of Prayers of St. Joseph Vaz 

Picture 21.1 - St. Joseph Vaz prayed in Kandy

St.  Joseph  was  a  prisoner  during  the  reign  of  King, Vimaladharmasooriya  II. 
At  that  time,  the  people  were  suffering  due  to  a  long  period  of  drought.  Not 
only  their cultivations  were destroyed, but also they did not have water even 
to drink. Buddhist and other religious rituals were done praying for rain. They 
were in vain. Finally, the king asked St. Joseph Vaz’s assistance. Having built 
an altar in front of the king’s palace and kept a cross on it, St. Joseph Vaz prayed 
in deep faith. Soon the sky got dark and it began to rain, but not a single drop 
of water fell on St. Joseph Vaz and the altar.

If  we  pray  fervently,  miracles  do  happen. Therefore,  we  should  pray  daily  in 
deep faith. By the experience we get through prayer, we can lead others also to 
pray in the same manner.

Ask Good Things in Prayer

We who become Catholics by Baptism inherit two lives, namely Worldly Life and 
Eternal Life. Although Worldly life is short, Eternal Life has no end. We have to 
hoard merits (spiritual rewards) for Eternal Life. In daily prayers, we must get 
used to pray for the betterment of the others. Even the Holy Bible teaches on the 
need of praying for the good things.

Prayer of King Solomon

At  Gibeon  God  appeared  to  King 
Solomon in a dream by night; and said, 
“Ask  what  I  should  give  you.”  King 
Solomon  said,  “Give  your  servant 
therefore  an  understanding  mind  to 
govern  your  people,  able  to  discern 
between  good  and  evil;  for  who 
can  govern  this  your  great  people?” 
(1  Kings  3:9).  This  prayer  of  King 
Solomon pleased God. Therefore, God 
promised King Solomon to give a wise 
and discerning mind, riches and honor. 

This shows that we have to pray for an 
understanding mind to discern between 
good  and  evil.  In  the  same  way,  this 
stresses that we will have to pay if we 
go away from God.  This teaches that if 

Picture 22.1 - King Solomon

PB

91

one keeps away from sin, God will fulfill our necessities.

Ask, and it will be given you; search, and you will find; knock, 
and the door will be opened for you. For everyone who asks 
receives, and everyone who searches finds, and for everyone 
who knocks, the door will be opened. Is there anyone among 
you who, if your child asks for bread, will give a stone? Or if 
the child asks for a fish, will give a snake? If you then, who are 
evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much 
more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who 
ask him!

           (Matthew 5:7-11)

We  must  make  it  a  point  to  search  what  is  spiritually  good,  but  not  what  is 
materially good. Your life becomes meaningful if you live for others. We must 
have a great personality, if we are to live for others and to make others happy. The 
good brings us closer to God. If one looks for only material things, he may get 
ruined. Possessing material things may take us away from God. Therefore, one 
who decides what is good is God.

Activity

1.  Write two parables that show that God gives good things to those 

who ask. 

2.  Write two examples that you can imitate from the prayer of King 

Solomon.

3.  Write  in  50  words  how  you  explain  the  need  of  prayer  to  your 
friend who says, “God does not give even good things even if we 
ask them in prayer.” 

92

For Life

Pray for only what is good.

And holy is His name.
From age to age he shows his love,
And his mercy is forever to his servants,
For he stretches out his arm, casts down the mighty.
And raises up the meek.

He fills the hungry with good food.
When the rich demand their share,
Their hands are empty.
He has kept all his promises to Israel:
His mercy is made known.

To God the Father we sing praise,
And to Jesus, whom he sent to be our Saviour!
To the Spirit of God be all glory,
For holy is his name!

PB

There are three Canticles in the New Testament, sung by various people in praise 
of the graces they received from God. 

1. The  Canticle  of  the  Blessed  Virgin  Mary (Magnificat) (Luke    
    1:46-55)

Virgin Mary went to Zechariah’s house to visit St. Elizabeth and greeted her. 
Then the child in St. Elizabeth’s womb leaped for joy. Having filled with the 
Holy Spirit, St. Elizabeth exclaimed with a loud cry. Then Virgin Mary sang 
this Canticle:

My soul magnifies the Lord,
and my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour,
for he has looked with favour on the lowliness of his servant.
Surely, from now on all generations will call me blessed;
for the Mighty One has done great things for me,
and holy is his name.
His mercy is for those who fear him
from generation to generation.
He has shown strength with his arm;
he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.
He has brought down the powerful from their thrones,
and lifted up the lowly;
he has filled the hungry with good things,
and sent the rich away empty.
He has helped his servant Israel,
in remembrance of his mercy,
according to the promise he made to our ancestors,
to Abraham and to his descendants forever.

     (Luke 1:46-55)

2. The Canticle of Zachary (Luke 1:68-79)

94

Zachary was dumb till the birth of St. John the Baptist and once he got the 
ability to talk; he praised God in this manner:

95

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel,
for he has looked favourably on his people and redeemed them.
He has raised up a mighty saviour for us
in the house of his servant David,
as he spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets from of old,
that we would be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who 
hate us.
Thus he has shown the mercy promised to our ancestors,
and has remembered his holy covenant,
the oath that he swore to our ancestor Abraham,
to grant us that we, being rescued from the hands of our enemies,
might serve him without fear, in holiness and righteousness
before him all our days.
And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High;
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways,
to give knowledge of salvation to his people
by the forgiveness of their sins.
By the tender mercy of our God,
the dawn from on high will break upon us,
to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,
to guide our feet into the way of peace.

(Luke 1:68-79)

3. The Canticle of Simeon (Luke 2:29-32)

When the time came for the purification according to the Law of Moses, the 
parents  of  Lord  Jesus  brought  him  up  to  Jerusalem  to  present  him  to  God. 
Then Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying:

94

95

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Master, now you are dismissing your servant in peace,
according to your word;
for my eyes have seen your salvation,
which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples,
a light for revelation to the Gentiles
and for glory to your people Israel.

        (Luke 2:29-32)

In the same manner, we, Catholics should get trained to praise God in our day-
to-day prayer.

Types of Prayer

24.1 Picture - Praying to God

Prayer is a dialogue that carries the needs of the people to God and that helps man 
to understand the will of God. We can build a deep relationship with God through 
prayer. There are three types of prayer in the Christian tradition.

1. VOCAL PRAYER

Vocal  prayer  is  prayer  using  words  either  loud  or  silently.  E.g.  Prayer  of  St. 
Francis of Assisi and Our Father

Whether or not our prayer is heard depends not on the number 
of  words,  but  on  the  fervour  of  our  souls.  Vocal  prayer  is  an 
essential element of the Christian life. To his disciples, drawn by 
their Master's silent prayer, Jesus teaches a vocal prayer, the Our 
Father. Vocal prayer is the form of prayer most readily accessible 
to groups.

(CCC 2700-2704)

PB

97

 
 
 
 
 
 
2. MEDITATION

Meditation is above all a quest. In that quest, the mind seeks to understand two 
things:

1.  the purpose of Christian life  
2.  How the Christian life has to be lived

In meditation, we do these two things in order to adhere and respond to what God 
is expecting from us.

To  meditate  on  what  we  read  helps  us  to  make  it  our  own  by 
confronting it with ourselves. To the extent that we are humble 
and faithful, we discover in meditation the movements that stir 
the heart and we are able to discern them. Meditation is only a 
guide;  the  important  thing  is  to  advance,  with  the  Holy  Spirit, 
along the one way of prayer: Christ Jesus. Christian prayer tries 
above all to meditate on the mysteries of Christ, as in the Prayer 
of the Church or the rosary.

(CCC 2705-2708)

3. CONTEMPLATIVE PRAYER

Contemplative prayer is possible for those who have reached the higher levels of 
prayer. Vocal prayer is the first stem of contemplative prayer. 

Thus says St. Teresa about contemplative prayer: "Contemplative prayer in my 
opinion is nothing else than a close sharing between friends; it means taking time 
frequently to be alone with him who we know loves us."

Entering  into  contemplative  prayer  is  like  entering  into  the  Eucharistic  liturgy. 
We recollect our whole being under the prompting of the Holy Spirit, abide in the 
dwelling place of the Lord which we are, awaken our faith in order to enter into 
the presence of Him who awaits us.

Contemplation is a gaze of faith, fixed on Jesus. Contemplative prayer 
is  hearing  the  Word  of  God.  Contemplative  prayer  is  a  silent  love. 
Contemplative prayer is a union with the prayer of Christ insofar as it 
makes us participate in his mystery. 

98

(CCC 2709-2719)

99

 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
These types of prayer are useful for us to grow in our Christian spiritual life. We 
should pay attention to that. We must take part in all the prayer services, organized 
in the parish. 

Prayer of Saint Francis of Assisi

Lord, make me an instrument of your peace.
Where there is hatred, let me bring love.
Where there is offense, let me bring pardon.
Where there is discord, let me bring union.
Where there is error, let me bring truth.
Where there is doubt, let me bring faith.
Where there is despair, let me bring hope.
Where there is darkness, let me bring your light.
Where there is sadness, let me bring joy.
O Master, let me not seek as much
to be consoled as to console,
to be understood as to understand,
to be loved as to love,
for it is in giving, that one receives,
it is in self-forgetting that one finds,
it is in pardoning, that one is pardoned,
it is in dying, that one is raised to eternal life.

  A p

AsIPA stands for “Asian Integral Pastoral Approach.” 

History and Background

In 1990 more than 400 Bishops of Asia gathered at Bandung in Indonesia for the 
5th Plenary Assembly of Federation of Asian Bishops Conferences (FABC). As a 
result of deep meditation of the Bishops of this Assembly, AsIPA was proposed.

It  aims  to  implement  the  vision  of  the  new  way  of  being  Church,  to  train  lay 
people  to  take  leadership  and  carry  out  their  mission  in  the  Church  and  in  the 
world. It also aims to make laity to read the Word of God in the Small Christian 
Communities and to act accordingly.

100

It also was revealed that this can be implemented in the parishes by establishing 
Small  Christian  Communities.  Therefore,  it  is  very  essential  to  form  Small 
Christian Communities, based on the Word of God. 

101

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Preparing the Place for AsIPA Meeting
 ² Select a place suitable for the AsIPA meeting
 ² Place a table in that place and cover the table with a white cloth
 ² Place the Holy Bible on the table as it is kept on the Ambo
 ² Place a lamp of oil in front of the Holy Bible and light it
 ² All sit around the Holy Bible as a small group

Seven Steps

Step One:   WE INVITE THE LORD

The facilitator asks a few people in the group to invite Lord Jesus in a personal 
and friendly manner in short prayers. 

E.g.   

 ² Lord Jesus, as you came to the house of Martha and Maria, come to 

our midst.

 ² Lord  Jesus,  as  you  came  to  the  house  of  Zacchaeus,  come  to  our 

midst.

 ² Lord Jesus, you who said, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life” 

come to our midst.

Step Two:   WE READ THE TEXT

 ² Let us turn to the Gospel of St. … Chapter … (Say this twice)
 ² Turn Chapter … Verse … to Verse ….
 ² Invite two or three people to read the text slowly and prayerfully

Step Three:   WE PICK OUT WORDS AND MEDITATE ON THEM

 ² Pick out words or short phrases, read them aloud prayerfully, and keep silence 

in between.

Step Four:   WE LET GOD SPEAK TO US IN SILENCE

 ² We keep silence for three minutes and allow God to speak to us.

100

101

 
Step Five:   WE SHARE WHAT WE HAVE HEARD IN OUR HEARTS

 ² Share the experience that you have in relation to the words or short phrases that 

you picked up.

Step Six:   WE DISCUSS ANY TASK WHICH OUR GROUP IS CALLED 

TO DO

 ² Give chance to make some proposals which may help those in need.
 ² Among those proposals, select the best one to be implemented in the near future.

Step Seven:   WE PRAY TOGETHER SPONTANEOUSLY

 ² Invite some to thank the Lord for being with the group. (Even the prayers of the 

faithful can be said)

Foreword

The  educational  objectives  of  the  contemporary  world 
are becoming more complex along with the economic, social, cultural and 
technological development. The learning and teaching process too is changing 
in  relation  to  human  experiences,  technological  differences,  research  and 
new indices. Therefore, it is required to produce the textbook by including 
subject  related  information  according  to  the  objectives  in  the  syllabus  in 
order to maintain the teaching process by organizing learning experiences 
that suit to the learner needs. The textbook is not merely a learning tool for 
the learner. It is a blessing that contributes to obtain a higher education along 
with a development of conduct and attitudes, to develop values and to obtain 
learning experiences.

The government in its realization of the concept of free 
education has offered you all the textbooks from grades 1-11. I would like 
to remind you that you should make the maximum use of these textbooks 
and protect them well. I sincerely hope that this textbook would assist you to 
obtain the expertise to become a virtuous citizen with a complete personality 
who would be a valuable asset to the country.

I would like to bestow my sincere thanks on the members 
of the editorial and writer boards as well as on the staff of the Educational 
Publications Department who have strived to offer this textbook to you.

Social Security

Introduction

Working  together  is  a  basic  feature  that  can  be  seen  in  a  society.  Each 
individual  in  a  society  has  the  right  to  a  life  of  freedom  away  from  fear  and 
suspicion. Having established that right, social security is strengthened. 

Family,  school,  religious  institutions  and  social  institutions  render  a 
special service to establish social security. The government has also established 
various institutions and special mechanisms to ensure social security.

Several factors contribute to social security. Citizens in a society need to 
be well-educated and self disciplined. They need to show respect towards others 
in  dealing  with  them.  These  factors  contribute  heavily  to  social  security  in  a 
cohesive multi-cultural society. 

Social  security  is  a  factor  that  affects  the  personal  development,  social 
development and national development in a society. By studying this chapter, you 
will be able to achieve a wide knowledge about the following:

Individual and society

 ²
 ² Social security
 ²
 ² The mechanisms as well as laws and rules that are utilized to establish social 

Institutes that contribute to social security

security 

 ² Duties and responsibilities of an individual to influence social security

1.1 Individual and Society 

1.1.1 Introducing society

Family is the basic unit in a society. Society is a collection of several families. 
A group of people living in certain geographical region working in collaboration 
to achieve their various needs is a basic feature of a society. They establish various 
institutes, societies and organizations for that. Accordingly, society is a collection 
of individuals and organizations.

Individual

Family 

 Society

Every  person  is  a  member  of  some  society. They  maintain  frequent  inter 

relationships to fulfill their needs. 

Each  society  has  its  own  customs,  rules  and  regulations,  acceptances, 
ethics, agreements and traditions. They are common features to all societies. These 
common features contribute to make the societies colourful. 

By  nature,  societies  of  the  modern  day  are  very  complex.  Therefore,  to 
fulfill their needs, it has become very necessary for individuals to maintain cordial 
relationships with others. Everyone needs the help of different people and social 
institutions.  Strong  relationships  between  individuals  in  a  society  contribute  to 
peaceful co-existence.  

1.1.2 Social security

Society must ensure protection and security for a person to live free from 
doubt and fear, safeguarding one's interests. Simply, it can be introduced as social 
security.  Establishing  social  protection  and  good  existence  to  the  maximum  is 
essential for the social development. 

People need to accept and honour the rules and regulations in any society. 
This ensures social security. At the same time, to ensure social security, it is essential 
to organize both people and institutions at different levels. 

Both  visionaries  and  groups  looking  far  into  the  future,  contribute  to  the 

creation of a strong, secure society.

Abraham Lincoln (1809 - 1865) is a former 
president of the United States of America. 
He worked hard to establish social security 
of millions of people who suffered as slaves 
by  abolishing  slavery  in  the  USA.  He 
directly  opposed  the  spreading  of  slavery 
and denounced ''Free labour in free soil'' too. He is 
a prudent leader who established social security by 
being the emancipator of millions of slaves in 1863. 
''Whatever  you  are  be  a  good  one''  is  one  of  his 
famous sayings.

1.1.3  Institutions  that  contribute  towards  the  social  security  and  services 
          rendered

In  any  society  there  are  a  number  of  institutions  that  contribute  to  the 

establishment of the social security. Examples for some of them are given below:

Family

Social 
institutions

1.1.3.1 The role played by the family towards social security

Let us recall the lesson 'Our Family' 
we  have  learned  for  Civic  Education  in 
Grade 7. There, you had a chance to study 
tasks 
information  about  nature, 
more 
and  the  important  role  played  by  family. 
Accordingly,  family  renders  a  special  task 
for the establishment of social security. The 
basic training of adjusting an individual to the 
society is given in the family. Discipline and 
accepted behaviours, activities, role models 
and attitudes among members in a family help create a responsible individual. The 
responsibility  of  a  family  is  to  provide  a  disciplined  and  cultured  individual  to 
society. Nutrition, security, love, compassion, mercy, kindness and models received 
by  an  individual,  as  a  member  of  a  family  help  produce  confident,  balanced 
individual to society. This ensures protection and security too. In living together as 
members of a family, common feelings are developed and they directly contribute 
to the social security too.

It is necessary to provide the background for individuals to complete with 
such qualities to be raised in each family.  Then, social security is well established. 

Given below is an example to revel how family can contribute to social security:

As  a  small  child,  Thomas  Alwa  Edison,  came 
home  from  school  one  day  and  handed  over  a 
letter to his mother. He said, “Mom, my teacher 
gave me this letter.  She asked me to give it to 
you.  She wanted only you to read it.  What’s in 
this letter?”

She started reading the letter.  Her eyes welled with tears 
as she read the letter.  She read  out aloud to her child…

“Your son is a genius. This school is too small for him and 
doesn’t have  good enough teachers to  train him.   Please 
keep  him  at  home  and  teach  him  yourself.”    What  was 
written in the letter was carried out as advised.  

Thomas Alwa Edison 
who invented the light 
bulb (1841-1931)

Many years later, after Edison’s mother had died, he became the greatest inventor of 
the century.
One day he was going through an old trunk and, by chance, he came across the folded 
letter that his old teacher wrote to his Mother. He opened it…
The message written in the letter was “Your son is a great fool.  We cannot allow 
him to continue his studies in this school.  Please keep him at home and teach him 
yourself.”

After reading the letter Edison became emotional and then wrote in his diary:
“Thomas Alwa Edison was a great fool whose mother turned him into the genius of 
the century.”

1.1.3.2 The contribution from school towards social security

From the family, children next step 
into  school  society.  The  school  too  shares 
equal responsibility like the family towards 
social  security.  School  can  be  introduced 
as  a  well  organized  institution  where  the 
necessary background for the establishment 
of  social  security  is  widely  organized. 
Knowledge,  attitudes,  skills  and  good 
discipline  you  achieved  from  the  school 
help you a lot to live as a good citizen in the 
society.

Read the story given below about a teacher directing a student along the correct 
path.

Tim, admitted to Grade 1, showed lots of talents in many subjects.  However, in 
the 2nd term of Grade 3, his teacher noticed a decline in his interests. The teacher 
observed  him  carefully  and  compared  his  continuous  assessments  during  the 
previous year. The teacher was anxious to find the reason for Tim's decline in 
performances, which were good at the beginning. The teacher got closer to Tim 
and  wanted  to  get  to  know  him.  She  learnt  that  during  the  1st  term  of  Grade  3,  Tim's 
mother fell ill and had died. The shock and the separation from his mother made  Tim 
uncomfortable. He was frustrated.   

Aware of the reason for Tim’s sudden decline in his work, the teacher became a mother 
to Tim. She showered him with love and affection coming from a mother.  The teacher 
came to be a goddess, more or less.  Tim picked up and showed enthusiasm with his studies 
again. The school became as pleasant place to him.  At the end of the year, the teacher's 
table was filled with the presents brought by students. Tim honoured the teacher with a 
gift wrapped in a piece of paper.   The present was a discolored  bangle  worn  by Tim's 
mother. The teacher accepted it with great appreciation.

Time  passed. Tim  developed  many  talents  while  in  primary  and  secondary  school.  He 
successfully completed University education too. The day of his marriage arrived. This 
grateful child did not forget his beloved teacher who was like his own mother. She came 
for his wedding wearing the bangle given by Tim, years ago.

1.1.3.3 Contributions from the religious places towards the social security

Religious  places  contribute  immensely  to  build  a  peaceful  society  by 
establishing good habits and moral values. The primary objective of every religion is 
to make people aware of the importance of living co-operatively, harmoniously and 
unitedly as good citizens. Establishment of harmony among different religious and 
ethnic groups is also an important mission that must be performed by the religious 
institutions. Accordingly, religious institutions render an important mission for the 
establishment of social security. For that, some examples are given below:

Inculcating of good attitudes
Establishment of discipline and education
Driving towards spiritual development
Producing virtuous citizens
Rescuing  people  from  liquor  and  narcotics  with  sound  
advice regarding the harm done
Educating people about anti-social behaviour and damages  
caused  as  a  result  of  involvement  in  such  activities  and  
preventing such acts.
Raising awareness regarding co-operation and assistance
Teaching to use and protect customs and traditions
Setting of correct and positive vision about life

catholic  priest,  but  he  had  a  sound 
knowledge  of  Buddhism.  Buddhist 
songs  that  he  composed  are  very 
popular. He was called ''Priest in the 
temple'' because  he worked  hard to 

     bring about unity among religions.

1.1.3.4 Contribution from social institutions towards the social security

Individuals work in collaboration with social institutions and organizations 
to  fulfill  their  various  needs.  People's  needs  have  become  complex  and  various 
institutions  and  organizations  have  emerged  to  fulfil  these  necessities.  Some 
examples for such institutions are given below:

Children's 
Clubs

Sports Clubs

Student

Many  of  these  organizations  function  based  on  a  formal  plan  and  a 
constitution. The main objective of them is also to get social welfare improved by 
working collaboratively with each other. Thus, social institutions and organizations 
established  collectively  in  common  render  a  massive  service  for  ensuring  social 
security. Several examples for their activities are given below;

Developing of unity among members
Establishing of healthy inter-personal relationships
Practising to respect and to accept others' opinions
Respecting the leadership and fulfilling duties of followers

1.1.5 Liquor and usage of narcotics, anti-social activities and misconducts 

Escalating of  the  use  of  liquor  and  narcotics is  a  main  problem  faced  by 
the  present  society. Anti  social  and  practices  of  misconduct  also  have  increased 
as well. Various programmes are launched by the government to find solutions for 
them.  Other  than  that,  government  institutions,  various  organizations  and  many 
non-governmental organizations too have launched various activities in this regard. 

The  use  of  liquor  and  drugs  directly  influences  the  increase  of  various 
anti-social activities and misconducts. It is a well-known fact that could be seen and 
heard through various mass media that use of liquor and narcotics has become the 
main factor, influencing  the collapse of social security. 

The  task  load  performed  by  family,  school,  religious  institutions  and 
social  institutions  to  prevent  the  use  of  liquor  and  drugs,  anti  social  activities 
and misconducts is highly important for the society. There are many institutions 
training to eradicate or curtail such anti social activities for the establishment of 
social security.

Some examples for such organizations are shown below:

 ² National Board of Dangerous Drug Control
 ² Sri Lanka Police
 ² National Child Protection Authority
 ² Department of Probation and Child Care Services
 ² Liquor and Drug Information Centre
 ² Non governmental organizations such as Healthy Lanka, Sumithrayo,  

Mithuru Mithurio

1.1.6 Law for the social security

Introduction to law

System of all regulations imposed by the State to which all individuals of a 
country or society must obey can be simply introduced as law. Law is imposed for 
the prevention of unfavorable influences and damages occur in the society when an 
individual lives in the society, as well as to ensure peace and security.

Every society must be ruled according to the law in use. The fundamental 
responsibility  of  a  government  is  to  protect  law  and  peace  in  its  State.  Citizens 
are  expected  to  respond  and  act  according  to  the  law. When  the  law  is  violated, 
punishments are deserving. In every society where the authority of law is empowered 
well, justice, peace and social security are preserved.

Some attributes 
of law

Sources of law

Law has been enforced for social security and is based on various sources. 

Some examples are given below:

 ² Constitution    
 ² Regulations and Acts 
 ² Customs 

 ² Verdicts from courts
 ² Opinions of the scholars of law
 ² Religion

Law is tightly bound with the social needs. This clearly shows, as obeying 

and following the law is compulsory to all.  

Law is practised in two ways:

        1. Domestic law
        2. International law

1. Domestic law

The  law  that  is  enacted  and  exercised  pertaining  within  the  territorial 
boundary of a country is called domestic law. Domestic law varies from country to 
country.

1.1.7 Various institutions which are set to empower the law 

1. The court

The  jurisdiction,  protection  of  freedom  and  right  of  the  people  in  a 
democratic country are attended to by the court. Working the court independently 
causes to build confidence and respect for the court in citizens.

2. Sri Lanka police

Establishment of social security by protecting law 
and peace in the country is the main responsibility of the 
police. This is the speech presented by Samitha of Grade 9 
on 'Sri Lanka Police' at the morning assembly of the school.

Dear teachers and my dear brothers and sisters,

“Dhammo Bhave Rakkathi Dammachari” The one 
who behaves according to the Dhamma will be protected 
by the Dhamma (Doctrine) itself. This is the motto of the 
Police. Today I am going to deliver a speech on Sri Lanka 
Police. The main institution that protects us day and night 
continuously is Police. It is a great service that the police 
do to live us without fear and suspicion from the moment 
we awake in the morning and to the moment we go to sleep 
at night and from the moment we sleep at night and to the 
moment we awake in the morning. 

Official symbol of Sri 
Lanka Police

It is the police that protect us from thieves, robbers and criminals. Controlling 
traffic and helping pedestrians to cross roads are  a very common sight in urban 
areas. Provision of traffic warden training to students like us is also a great help 
rendered by the police. 

Provision  of  security  to  VIPs,  various  functions  and  meetings,  guidance 
with careful driving could be introduced as special services rendered by the police 
for us.

Some main functions of police are to curtail 
anti  social  activities  like  liquor,  narcotics,  arrest 
culprits  and  bring  them  into  the  strong  arm  of  the 
law.  Preventing  various  disputes,  conflicts  and 
terrorist  activities are  also  an  important mission  of 
the police. Police executes all these for the purpose 
of ensuring our security. Ensuring the protection of 
children like us and women by conducting separate 
units for them is a factor to be happy about.

The services rendered by the police in natural 
disasters like flood and earth slips are unforgettable. 
Further, it must be mentioned here that, the efficient 
performance  of  the  police  to  take  threatening 
criminals into custody within a short period of time. 
There, the functions performed by the police kennel 
service also must be commended. 

Furthermore,  the  police  executes  a  great 
service  by  acting  rapidly  on  sudden  disasters  and 
sudden accidents by conducting the 119 service.  

We should always respect the police for the

An incident related to the Police in the United Kingdom

Hyde Park Corner in the United Kingdom is a place where people 
gather  freely  during  week  ends.  Some  enjoy  by  dancing,  singing, 
participating in carnivals, delivering public speeches. One day, a person 
driving his vehicle near Hyde Park Corner heard a man delivering a public speech 
abusing the Police in the United Kingdom as low, mean, corrupted and fraudulent. 
The person in the vehicle slowed down the speed to listen to the speech. Suddenly, 
he saw a giant policeman speedily making his way towards his vehicle. 

He got alarmed thinking that he would be taken offence. The police man 
came closer to the vehicle, and said ''Please switch off the engine of your vehicle, 
people cannot hear the speech well because of the noise from your vehicle.''

After  the  independence,  Ceylon  Army  was 
established  on  10th  October,  1949.  Ceylon Army  was

Army.    Sri  Lanka Army  that  serves  under  the  motto, 
“For  the  Fatherland”  is  always  on  alert  both  in  day 
and  night  for  the  protection  of  motherland.  The

There  is  a  golden  fence  around  this  meritorious  land,  that  was 
offered  like  a  golden  flower  holding  in  the  cupped  hand  by  the 
gods, without letting even a lump of soil to get fall apart. While the 
whole world asleep in one dream, the divine light of the guarding 
gods of the land are burning throughout the night.

The sons who were brought up by holding at the bosom are now in 
the battle field armed with weapons. Fathers, seeing the deeds of 
bravery committed by them in battle fields intoxicated with moral 
and belligerent, honour them by keeping the hands on their heads. 
When they sacrifice their lives for the sake of motherland, breast 
of every mother in three parts of the island is welled with milk in 
their names.

Hail, Heroic boys! We have reborn here today by receiving a new 
lease of life from you as you were born not from mother’s womb 
but from the womb of the mother earth of Sri Lanka. You are never 
been isolated in the battle field as all your relatives, brothers, sons 
and daughters are with you in the battle fields in their hearts.

         other rules and regulations

Constitution is the fundamental law of the country. It is known as the supreme 
law too. Except the constitutions, criminal law, civil law and other Acts and orders 
are active for the establishment of social security. When they are functioning it is 
compulsory to act adjusting them, respecting and obeying them.

The following is a part of a discussion occurred among a group of students 
of Grade 9, regarding the duties and responsibilities of people on the constitution 
and other rules and regulations.

Being bound to act 
according to the constitution is a 
responsibility and duty of all

Obeying to other rules and 
regulations too is our obligation and

2.1  Changes in technology and responding to them

2.1.1 Introduction to technology

Man has been using various techniques to make his work easy. He had a 
motivation for it by birth. Accordingly, the methodology man utilizes to make his 
work easier can be simply introduced as Technology.

2.1.2 Changes in technology

With  the  down  fall  of  feudalism,  man  tends  to  use  books.  It  directly 
influenced to develop the thinking power of man. As a result of that, science and 
technology began to develop systematically. It is a pleasurable factor that the world 
is gifted with new inventions in parallel to that. Technological changes means the 
changes of methodologies that are used to make human need easier.

Man who lived in hunting era used stone tools to fulfill his activities. But 
later they developed systematically. Life of the past man was simple. So, he used a 
natural cave which was a wonderful creation of nature itself as his shelter. But with 
the development occurred with new inventions and technology he had to change 
systematically. As a result of that, man who lived in a cave, has made high luxury 
mansions  which  have  been  built  using  the  most  latest  methods  at  present  as  his 
habitat.

With  the  development  of  technology,  human  needs  too  have  become 
complex. The result of it, was the endowment of more electronic equipment to the 
world in place of old stone tools. This could be easily understood when we compare 
the equipment that have been used in the past kitchen with the present kitchen.

2.1.3 New Inventions through explorations and researches

With the gradual development of population, human needs also developed. 
Need  for  efficient  tools  arised  to  get  these  needs  fulfilled.  As  a  result  of  the 
industrial revolution that took place parallel to it in 18th century endowed more 
new  inventions  to  the  world.  It  is  not  a  secret  that,  explorations  and  researches 
conducted  then were a great boon to it. The study that is conducted to find some 
solutions to a problem following scientific methods is a research. Exploration 
and  researches  fulfill  a  specific  task  in  present  day  world.  Accordingly,  human 
needs too have been widened. Need arised for modified tools to fulfill them. It is 
more apt to introduce this as the most powerful factor that influenced to the origin 
of technical productions.   

2.1.4 Social changes that occur with the changes of technology

According  to  the  studies  conducted  from  past  to  present  it  is  clear  that 
several changes have occurred in technology. Due to these changes, more changes 
have occurred in various fields of the society too. Several changes that occurred in 
the society are shown below;  

 ² Change of the consumer pattern of man

 ² For the creation of new inventions
 ² For the acceleration of production efficiency 

2.1.6  Appropriate technology

Appropriate  technology  is  using  technology  to  suit  the  social,  economic, 
cultural and environmental conditions of the country. Using machinery to maximize 
the use of human labour in a country where human labour is in abundance can be 
cited as example. There are two important things that should be focused in using 
technology; advancing towards industrialization, preserving traditional industries 
and expanding technical needs bearable to the country.

2.1.7  Benefits  of  using  appropriate  technology  to  establish  sustainable 
          development 

Sustainable development means long-lasting and endurable development. 
Development that is conducted without destroying the resources that are necessary 
for  the  needs  of  future  generations  while  resources  are  used  for  the  present  day 
activities without damaging the environment is called sustainable development. The 
development process should get the maximum benefit of resources while avoiding 
wastage of resources.

Given  below  are  some  benefits  of  using  appropriate  technology  for  sustainable 
development:

 ² Avoiding wastage of resources
 ² Ability to take maximum use of labour resources
 ² Minimizing environmental pollution
 ² Ability to maintain a balanced environment

2.2 Adaptation to the changes in economy

2.2.1 Economical changes with technology

Resources in the environment are used to fulfill the unlimited and complex 
needs of man. These resources exist very limited in the environment. Man has been 
persuaded to produce goods and services using these limited resources to fulfill his 
needs since the ancient times. Accordingly, the three main processes that occur in 
an economy of any country can be identified as:

 ² Production
 ² Distribution
 ² Consumption

34

35

 
Production  means  changing  economical  resources  to  fufill  the  needs  of 
human. Conversion of existing resources into goods that are compatible with human 
needs using labour and techniques takes place in the process of production. The 
main process that takes place there is the conversion of raw materials into finished 
products. 

The  process  of  providing  manufactured  goods  and  services  up  to  the 
consumer is distribution. Transportation is a compulsory factor for it. Fulfillment of 
human needs by using goods and services produced in an economy is consumption. 
Above mentioned three processes are compulsory for the existence of an economy.

The changes that take place in an economy can be considered under three sections:

Changes take 
place in an 
economy

 Agricultural sector

Industrial sector

Service sector 

2.2.1.1 Contemporary changes take place in the agricultural sector 

Sri Lanka is a country which has made agriculture as its livelihood since 
past. There the paddy cultivation as muddy-cultivation (Mada Govithana) received 
a  prominent  place.  Chena  cultivation  as  land  cultivation  (Goda  Govithana)  also 
was popular. Apart from that the agricultural sector consists of the cultivations like 
vegetables, fruits, tubers, cereals and spices too. 

With  the  arrival  of  the Westerners,  plantation  began  to  be  popular  in  Sri 
Lanka. There, Tea, Rubber and Coconut occupied a special place as commercial 
crops. But they existed as primary productions. With the speedy development of the 
technology, a noted development could be seen in the local agricultural sector too. 
At present, more modern changes has taken place in association with this could be 
seen:

Examples - 
 ² Use of machinery for preparation of land, planting, harvesting, etc
 ² Use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides 
 ²

Introduction  of  hybrid  seeds  and  tissue-culture  plant  varieties  to  get 
short-term harvests 
 ² Use of gene technology 
 ² Utilization of new methods in irrigation 
 ² Use of modern methods of cultivations and greenhouse cultivation
 ² Diversification of productions

The results of modern technical inventions have been used mostly for the 
development in the field of industry. Because of this, products which were given 
great efforts to produce can be produced today at a lower time with greater quality 
with the use of developed machinery.

Results of them are:

 ² Existence of division of labour and specification  
 ² Origin of assembling industry
 ² Origin of high – technical industry
 ² Employing  robot technology in the process of production 
 ² Use of electronic and nano technologies
 ² Production of machineries and accessories necessary for explorations and 

researches (satellites and space crafts) 

Due to this, a rapid development took place in such sectors.

2.2.1.3 Changes occur in service sector

At present, the service sector occupies a special place in an economy. Services 
are  supplied  at  different  levels  from  the  production  of  goods  up  to  consumption 
of  them.  Here,  services  are  provided  with  different  fields  like  education,  health, 
banking,  insurance,  transport  and  trade.  In  the  supply  of  such  services,  use  of 
technology and its changes have occurred immensely.

How Education is influenced by technology

Minoli    -  In  the  past,  children  in  the  village  received 
education  from  the  educated  elderly  persons 
of  the  village.  It  was  called  'Guru  Gedara' 
Later  the  education  was  given  in  temples  and 
Pirivens.  The  writing  on  Veli  Pella  (Sand 
Board)  was  commonly  used. After  that  it  was 
changed into slate. 

Pavithra  - The formal schools in Sri Lanka were established 
during the period of Europeans. The main items 
used in the school were black board and chalk.

Pabasara -  Now  look  at  our  school.  How  many  facilities 
are  there  to  learn?  The  modern  equipment 
television,  overhead  projector, 
like  radio, 
multimedia  projector  and  computers  have 
become a massive strength to us in education. 
haven't they?

Health 

Health service too has been widened with modern technology. The fields 
like  diagnosis  of  diseases,  treatments,  production  of  pharmaceuticals,  etc.  have 
experienced a rapid development. Medical equipment that can be used to perform 
even very complex operations more easily have been invented. Due to the abundance 
of X-ray machines, CT scanner machines, etc. which are necessary to examine the 
patients, provision of services in the field of health has reached a higher level. 

Scanning machines

Banking

Banking services conducts transactions 
in  day  to  day  activities  of  man  more  easily. 
Possibility of depositing one's money safety as 
well  as  withdrawing  them  back  when  needed 
has been provided through this. At present, the 
possibility of carrying transactions, using teller 
cards  and  without  collecting  money  here  and 
there, has been dawned. By the introduction of 
Automated Teller Machines, an extra safety is 
provided  for  money.  Services  can  be  easily  fulfilled,  locally  and  internationally, 
through e-banking system. As well, by using modern technical equipment, money 
counting, forge currency, forge cheques and forge signatures can be identified.

Development of transportation through technology

Nikil          -  At the early age, people went their journeys on 
foot.  Later,  animals  were  used.  With  the 
invention  of  wheel,  people  were  motivated 
to  use  different  types  of  vehicles.  It  has 
developed  up  to  the  most  sophisticated  
vehicles at present.  

Nimasha     -  Transportation  occurs  in  several  modes: 
they  occur  on  land,  on  water  and  in  air. 
Super-luxury liner ships as well as aeroplanes 
can be seen.

Hansintha  -  Not  only  that.  The  aeroplanes  with  large 
number of passengers on board and also with 
thousands of kilos of cargo fly in the sky very 
lightly. When we see how the ships are loaded 
with thousands of container boxes sail on the 
sea, feel amazed as well. 

Harsha       -   At present, various modern methods are used 
in cargo transportation as well as in passenger 
transport.

Effect of technological development to communication 

Tharindu    -  Do  you  know  that  in  the  past  people  ''hooted''  to 
send a message to a distant person? Then the one in 
the distance, understanding the messages returned 
an answer by hooting 

Avishka      -   Not only that. I have heard that people in the past 
setting bonfire, sending drum-beaters, shooting the 
ola-leaves on which massage is written and using 
bows and arrows were also messages.

Pathum       -   Today we are more developed, friend! Now we can 
do all of them through mobile phone

2.3.1 Identifying new trends bound with job market

All  the  employment  opportunities  available  in  the  society  are  called  the 
world  of  work.  The  demand  for  the  employment  opportunities  available  in  the 
world of work and suitable supply for it can be simply defined as "Job Market". 
Chances for employments in present day world are in abundance. But, lack of skilled 
workers for these job opportunities has become an acute problem faced by many 
countries in the world. Because of this, identifying job opportunities available in the 
job market is important. Meanwhile, continuous awareness about the timely trends 
present in the job market is a must. As well, completing the necessary qualifications 
for them is also compulsory.

He is intelligent and clever. 

He gets up early in the morning. 
After washing his face 
He worships his parents. 
He sweeps the house.

When he takes books to study 
does not send his attention away 
on unnecessary things.

He always likes to do any work 
after informing elders.

Sirimath does not hesitate to 
think good things to say what he 
thinks and to do what he has said.

2.4.2 Necessity of well-being

Man  has  to  tend  towards  a  very  complex  life  pattern  in  this  competitive 
world. Development took place in the fields of modern science, technology, and 
communication  has  directly  influenced  it.  Diversities  of  likes  and  dislikes  of 
individuals have caused to make it more intensified. Due to this, majority in the 
society try to behave imitating blindly without understanding fertility and infertility. 
This condition has become a severe social problem at present. Because of this, for 
the social upliftment, there are many factors that affect the increase of necessity of 
well-being. Some examples for them are given below:   

 ² For the well-being of the society 

To  live  as  a  virtuous,  loyal  citizen  and  to  work  
law-abiding in a society

 ²

-Diversity in personal interests

One  should  follow  correct  procedure  when 
fulfilling  personal  interests  as  personal  interests, 
likes and expectations differ

 ² Complexity of the life style 

When life has become complex, there is a tendency for people to earn money 
in wrong ways. People should earn by proper ways to lead a simple life

 ² Directing to earn wealth and to use wealth in just 

      To direct citizens to earn by hard working and by his own efforts 

 ²

-Justice

Having society accepted livinghood and livelihood

 ² Peace

To maintain peace and harmony

2.4.4 Results that occur due to acting without well-being

One  will  have  to  face  severe  incidents  in  his  adult  life  as  the  qualities 
of  well-being  have  not  being  practiced  from  his  childhood.  As  the  qualities  of 
well-being are not practiced valuable human lives, animal lives, public properties, 
natural environment and all will be subjected to the unfavorable influences. Anyone 
who does not practise qualities of well-being, can be victimized to the fate expressed

The  sound  of  the  service  drum  beating  of  the Temple  of  the Tooth  Relic 
echoes.  Eyes  become  wet  recollecting  the  sins  I  have  committed.  I  have 
born hundred times while dying and drinking tears instead of water.

Received  the  wrong  advices. This  deadly  danger  befell  on  me  due  to  the 
company of bad friends. Earlier, I stepped alone a path full of wrongs. The 
end of that path occurs in gallows.

Do not come to prison at Bogambara.!

2.4.6 Co-existence  

Man  gets  his  birth  from  the 
family which is the smallest unit in 
the  society.  We  all  are  members  of 
it.  When  acting  as  a  member  of  a 
family, love and protection of others 
are needed' 

''Co-existence  begins  in  the 
Family'' 

Any individual living in the society cannot live alone. Man happens to get 
support from various individuals and to assist each other. Man had been used to 
live in groups since his inception. Accordingly, acting co-operatively, while living 
together can be simply introduced as co-existence. An erudite concept presented on 
it is shown below: 

"Co-existence is a state in which two or 
more  groups  are  living  together  while 
respecting their differences and resolving 
their conflicts nonviolently"

2.4.10 How well-being and co-existence become important for the individual 
           and social development

Well-being and co-existence are two concepts bound to each other. There are many 
well-being  qualities,  derived  from  the  past  through  generations,  practiced  by  us. 
These qualities that are seen within us at large or minor level help for personal and 
social development. According to the availability of  these qualities, several groups 
of people can be identified in the society. It should be noted that this categorization 
is based on the most outstanding characteristics of people. 

01. Those who have high well-being qualities but less co-existence qualities  - 
The  people earn wealth by means of just or legal ways. They live without disturbing 
others. They contribute less in sharing happiness or sorrow with neighbours and 
friends. Participation for the weddings or funerals are also very less. They do not 
harm anyone, but the contribution to the social development is very poor.

02. Those who possess high co-existence qualities but less well-being qualities  - 
These people earn wealth through various legal and illegal means. But, mostly lead 
a friendly life with neighbours and relatives, sharing their sorrows and happinesses. 
They are a burden to the society. Their means of income are not recommended by 
the society.

03. Those who possess less well-being and co-existence qualities -This type of 
people also can be seen among us occasionally. They earn wealth through different 
illegal means and nothing is done for the social development. They do not work 
co-operatively with others. You should be mindful when associating with them. You 
should determine to make them virtuous if possible and not to be such a person. 

04.  Those  who  possess  both  well-being  and  co-existence  qualities  to  the 
maximum - These people earn wealth through just and legal means. They offer 
to help neighbours and relatives frequently. Those, who with such well-being and 
co-existence  qualities  are  a  great  blessing. You  should  also  determine  to  be  one 
such person. In this manner, by developing qualities of well being and co-exitance 
in you, you can contribute to the social upliftment, fruitfully. However, it should be

noted that the categorization of people in society as ''Good'' or ''Bad'' is not suitable. 
In a person who is well-known as ''bad'', there can be a little good. One should take 
efforts to inculcate wholesome qualities understanding characteristics of people are 
a complex. This helps personal and social development.

Activity 2.4 

1.  List out the virtues you have identified in you and your friends or 

elders you associate. 

2.  Present  a  role  play  in  two  minutes  to  highlight  the  well-being 

qualities.

3.  Complete the following table with the influences that occur when  

well-being is not followed.

for the social development.

2.5 Co-operative Movement

2.5.1 Introduction to co-operative movement

Sri  Lankans  have  been 
motivated to live in co-existence 
since  past.  It  is  well-aware 
that  you  might  have  studied 
well-about  well-being 
and  
co-existence  in  earlier  lessons. 
People  show  much  willingness 
to help each other in the activities 
''Aththam'',  Sramadana, 
like 
meritorious  activities,  planting 
paddy, etc.

Accordingly,  The  co-operative  movement  can  be  introduced  as  the 
organization  that  was  established  voluntarily  to  get  common  needs  and  social 
welfare done collectively, co-operatively and equality. 

British nationalist Robert Owen is considered as the ''Father of Co-operative 

Movement''. Read carefully the definition presented by him. 

The Co-operative Movement is the service based on good social environment 
which includes feeling of co-operation and social value in place of competition 
that exists among the people for economic development.

British nationalist, Robert Owen – 1845

The following definition is the official definition about modern co-operative 

movement presented by International Cooperative Alliance.

A  co-operative  is  an  autonomous  association  of  persons  united  voluntary  to 
meet their common economic, social and cultural needs and aspirations through 
a jointly owned and democratically – controlled enterprise.

(International Co-operative Alliance -ICA - 1995)

Working collectively and helping each other mutually are the main features 
of  co-operation.  Through  this,  the  spacial  quality  expected,  is  the  collaboration 
instead of competitiveness.

2.5.2 Several objectives of the co-operative movement 

 ² Fulfilling the needs of the members 
 ² Creating a path for man to live better
 ² Assisting to upgrade the living condition of people
 ² Fulfill the needs by the collective power that can not be fulfilled individually

The motto of the co-operative is 

''Each for all – All for each''

2.5.4 Multi Purpose Co-operative Societies and School Co-operative Societies 

1. Multi-purpose co-operative societies

There  are  a  large  number  of  co-operative  societies  controlled  by  the 
Co-operative Department. The institutions which have been established collecting 
all  together  are  introduced  as,  multi-purpose  cooperative  societies.  Co-operative 
societies  that  have  been  established  to  get  more  tasks  fulfilled,  instead  of  credit 
cooperative societies are introduced by this name.   

The  basic  objective  of  this  is  to  create  economic,  social  and  cultural 
development  of  members  according  to  the  co-operative  principles. The  target  of 
this is to inculcate feelings such as thrifty, self donation and mutual donation. To 
get the membership of a co-operative society, 18 years of age must be completed. 
All those who reside in the authorized region of a co-operative society, can get the 
membership of the co-operative society of that particular region. Many co-operative 
societies can be seen in present Sri Lanka. By December 2013, 14221 co-operative 
societies had been established in Sri Lanka. Among them, 308 were multi-purpose 
co-operative societies. Among them the number of co-operative societies that are 
active are 304.

2. School co-operative societies 

School  co-operative  societies  have  been  established  with  the  idea  that 
the cooperative must be started at the small age. These co-operative societies are 
conducted by the students under the patronage of the principal and the staff. The

2.6  Importance  of  acting  as  a  member  of  global  village  while 
       protecting indigenousness

2.6.1 Broad vision about the world 

Man is a member of the global village. When we act as a member of the 
global village, we must create a good understanding about the world. When acting 
in the competitive world there must be a broad vision about it. Various changes 
in the fields like economic, society, and politics of the present world take place 
continuously.  As  a  citizen,  a  knowledge  and  understanding  about  all  those 
changes  must  be  achieved. Acting  with  the  world  with  such  knowledge  and 
understanding is known as the broad vision of the world. 

Due  to  the  continuous  changes  occur  in  the  world,  inheritance  of  new 
information and more creations occur changing existing information. When acting 
as  a  universal  member,  being  vigilant  on  these  changes  is  important.  You  must 
assist them as much as you can. That becomes a great support to make others lives 
as well as your life, good. 

2.6.2 Appreciate indigenousness meaningfully  

Indigenous culture

All  the  countries  in  the  world  possess  specific  cultures  inherited  to  each 
of  them.  That  is  the  indigenous  culture  of  those  countries.  Sri  Lanka  too  is  a 
multi-cultural country since the past. As well as indigenous people, different ethnic 
groups  like  Sinhalese,  Tamils,  Muslims,  and  Burghers  live  in  Sri  Lanka.  They 
believe in  different religions like Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and Catholicism. 
There  are  identical  cultures  inherited  to  these  ethnic  groups.  Various  different 
cultural features can be seen in them.

Things endemic to the country

Things that are typical to a country itself are called endemic things. Many 
features,  which  are  endemic  to  Sri  Lanka  are  found  in  the  country.  Indigenous 
medicines, endemic plants and animals are important among them.

Identification and learning of other cultures by moving beyond the local frame 

We  have  learnt  about  the  indigenous  culture  and  main  cultural  features  
earlier.  There  are  many  cultural  features  indigenous  to  Sri  Lanka,  and  to  other 
countries as well. Though they are inherited to those countries only, we can learn 
a lot from them. Hence, it is important to know about cultural features of several 
countries going beyond, indigenous culture. 

There  are  many  cultural  features  in  Japan  that  is  an  East Asian  country. 
Greeting with a bow, wearing Kimono, sumo game, veneration of the dead take an 
important place among them. Japan is a country that has processed to a massive 
development. But, Japan reached the development while protecting their culture. 
Cultural features like greeting with a bow is well-popular among the elders and the 
young even today.

Acting  as  a  member  of  global  society  while  appreciating  the  indigenousness 
and protecting national identity

We  have  discussed  about  the  ''Wide  vision  about  the  world''  earlier. 
Accordingly, arrival of new technology, fashions, cultural features, etc occur with 
the changing of the world. But we must be intelligent when we use them. We must 
be careful to use the models we collect from the universal society, matching the 
needs of our country. If not, we will have to face problems we never think about.  

You might have heard the saying '' Siya Rata de Siri Sapade'' – Local goods  
give best comforts – Our forefathers in the past produced everything they needed 
by themselves. There, they were very careful not to harm animals, plants and the 
environment. They gifted the needful for generation absorbing world's knowledge 
while  protecting  ancient  culture. A  best  example  for  this  can  be  taken  from  our 
neighbouring country, India. Since the past, Indians show a  tendency to use local 
productions. That example has been given to them even from the rulers of India.

We too must be nourished by such models. We must be careful to use models 

received from those cultures with local modifications.

2.6.3 Identification of the way how co-existence works globally 

Any person living in the world cannot 
live  alone.  Living  alone  is  a  difficult  task  for 
any ethnic group or a country. There are several 
factors cause for this: 

 ² Unequal distribution of resources 
 ² Global diversity
 ²

Inability to produce all the things needed 
for a country in the same country

 ² Rapid  development  of 

information 
technology  of  the  world  with  the 
technical advancement

 ² Conversion  of  the  total  world  into  a 

global village

 Above mentioned factors have caused 
to function co-existence globally. We all, as an 
individual  and  as  a  country,  have  to  work  in 
accordance with. If not, we will be isolated as 
a country in the presence of the world.

too mutual inter dependence, co-operation and co-existence can be seen. Working 
inter-dependency. 
co-operatively  while  helping  each  other 
Co-existence among ethnic types and religions is the base of peace and development 
of a country. As a country, there is a mutual inter-dependency with other countries of 
the world. Due to this, various organizations have been established by the countries  
of  the world.

Democratic 
Governance

Introduction

Democracy is a governing system as well as a life style. Democracy can 
simply be defined as a governing system based on public preference. Among the 
governing systems seen in the world today, the democratic governance has been 
given a prominent place. 

Studying this chapter, you will be able to gain broader understanding about the 
followings:

 ² Democracy 
 ² Basic features of a democratic governance
 ² Duties bound by the rights of a citizen in a democratic society 
 ² Tasks should be done by the political parties to establish social unity
 ² Elections and franchise of a democratic society 
 ² Acting as a democratic citizen with assertiveness 
 ² Contribution to nation building as a democratic citizen

3.1.1  Introduction to democracy

The class teacher of Grade 9 of Namalyaya Maha Vidyalaya wanted to elect 
a  monitor  at  the  beginning  of  the  new  term. The  teacher  inquires  the  students  a 
suitable way to elect. Given below is a part of the conversation took place:

Teacher,  let's  have  a  vote  and  elect  the  monitor  by  checking  the 
preference. I think it is a democratic way to do this.

Chenethu, What a lot you know! Today we will be able to learn about 
democracy.  There  is  a  topic  of  Democracy  in  our  Civic  Education 
subject.

The  English  word  ''Democracy''  is  formed  by  two  Greek  words  ''Demos''  and 
Kratos''.  ''Demos''  means  public  while  ''kratos''  denotes  power.  Therefore,  the 
meaning of the word ''Democracy'' in Greek language is the power of people.

Scholars  have  given  various  definitions  for  Democracy.  A  few  such 

definitions are given below for your knowledge: 

Democracy is a public governance done by the people for the people.

Abraham Lincoln

Democracy is a governing system which provides rights for everybody.

Sealer

Democracy can be introduced as a system of governance done by the people 
with the decision of the majority. 

Democracy  is  important  as  a  governing  system,  as  well  as  a  life  style. 
Fulfilling duties while enjoying rights, respecting others' views, taking decisions 
through discussions and respecting equity are some of the features of a democratic 
life style. Through making such features as the vision of people, a good and peaceful 
society builds up. It is important to develop such features as a member of a family 
as well as a member of the school. Further, developing such features within all the 
members of the society confirms the well-being of a democratic governance. 

Activity 3.1

1.  Collect some definitions of democracy. 
2.  Build up a simple definition of democracy of your own.

Direct democracy 

The main feature of direct democracy is the direct participation of people 
in  governing. The  governance  that  existed  in  Greek  City  State  (known  as  polis) 
of Athens  was  direct  democracy.  The  main  governing  institution  of Athens  was 
citizen council. There the public opinion was inquired directly. All the citizens had 
participated in governance.

Direct involvement of people in decision making and governance is 
direct democracy.

Women,  slaves  and  foreigners  were  not  allowed  to  participate  in  the 
governance in Athens where direct democracy functioned. Only elderly male resided 
in the city were given opportunity to take an active role in the direct democratic 
governance.

democracy at present giving examples.

2.  List out some weaknesses in direct democracy in Greek State of 
  Athens if any.

Indirect democracy 

 ² As it was difficult to implement direct democracy, indirect democracy began. 
 ² Governing done by the public representatives is a feature of indirect democracy. 

Public representatives are elected by the elections held time to time.  
Indirect democracy can be introduced as representative democracy.

 ²

The constitution provides opportunities to inquire the public preference 
directly on some factors in countries where indirect democracy functions today. 

Referendum  can  be  regarded  as  an  example  for  a  function  of  direct 
democratic  procedure.  Holding  referendum  is  legalized  by  the  present  Sri 
Lankan constitution, in our country too.

3.1.2 Basic features of a democratic governance

The  basic  feature  of  a  democratic  governance  is  that  the  government  is 
directed by the representatives elected by the decision of the majority. There can be 
many features seen where a democratic governance is practised.

right to live freely is the most important among all the others.

We have a right to do a legal job, don't we?

It is important to have the right to follow any religion one 
likes.

One student listened to this conversation, and summarized the rights of a 

citizen as follows:

 ² Right to live 
 ² Right to possess a name and a nationality 
 ² Right to obtain education 
 ² Right to do a legal job
 ² Right to follow a religion that one likes 
 ² Right to elect rulers 
 ² Right to live in an area that one likes 
 ² Right to vote a party that one prefers 
 ² Right to join unions

Duties bound by rights cause for the safeguarding of rights. This would also 

safeguard other's rights. Let's inquire such duties.

3.2.2 Duties to be fulfilled to the society while enjoying rights

When enjoying rights, what we have to fulfill to the society can be regarded 
as duties. Each duty is bound by a right. In fact duties and rights are like two 
sides of a coin. As Sri Lankans, we have been fulfilling duties from generation  
to generation since past. 

Fulfilling duties is a must to safeguard peace and harmony, co-existence and 
social security in a democratic society. 

According to that, there are many duties to be fulfiled to the society, as a 

citizen, when we enjoy the rights. Some examples are given below:

 ² Educate well
 ² Obeying and respecting parents/teachers
 ² Caring elders
 ² Keeping the environment clean
 ² Protecting public property
 ² Respecting and caring religious leaders
 ² Being law-abiding 
 ² Assisting the police and the security forces
 ² Paying taxes regularly and accurately imposed by the government 
 ² Being honest to pay bills for the services used
 ² Avoiding bribery and anti social activities and help to abolish them 
 ² Avoiding anti social activities
 ² Rejecting terrorism
 ² Protecting cultural heritage 
 ² Not being treacherous
 ² Proper garbage disposal and support the steps taken by the government 
 ² Fostering the national unity

As a student, your duty is to have a good education and be a good citizen to 
the society. For that, teachers' duty is to provide you with knowledge, skills, 
attitudes and competencies. Fulfilling duties by the teachers would directly 
influence to safeguard your rights.

The basic duties to be fulfilled by a citizen are given in the Article No. 28 of 

the constitution of 1978. Some of them are given below:

 ² To defend and follow the constitution and the law
 ² To improve the national upliftment and to foster national unity 
 ² To work faithfully in one's chosen occupation
 ² To  preserve  and  protect  public  property,  and  to  combat  against  misuse  of 

public property and waste

 ² To respect the rights and freedom of others
 ² To protect nature and conserve its natural resources

3.2.3 Importance of enjoying rights within the legal frame work

Every citizen has to enjoy rights within the legal frame work. Otherwise, it 
would cause to violate others' rights. If all the citizens enjoy rights within the legal 
frame work, it will cause the national development.

 ² Although every citizen has a right to use a road, that should be done under the 

rules and regulations of roadways. 

 ² Although every citizen has a right to do a job, that job should be a legal one. 
 ² Although there is a right to win labour rights, it should not be done against 

the law of the country.

When  enjoying  rights  some  limitations  are  imposed  with  the  intension  of 
protecting  social  well-being  and  peace.  Some  examples  for  that  are  media 
prohibition during war conditions, rallies at times of destroying lives and public 
property and prohibiting picketing can be taken as some examples. That is highly 
effective towards the social well-being as well as the national development.

3.3 Let's identify the functions of a political party 

3.3.1 Introducing political parties  

There  was  a  discussion  about  political  parties  between  two  Grade  9 
students. Given below are two simple definitions of political parties presented by 
two students:

A group of people 
organized for the 
purpose of getting 
power is a political 
party.

A group of people 
represented to fulfil 
the needs of the 
country is a political 
party. 

Definitions of political parties given by various scholars are stated below for your 
knowledge:

A political party is an 
organized entity of people 
with the aim of getting the 
power of the country and 
enacting it based on state 
principles.

What is meant by a political party is a group of people organized to obtain the 
State power based on certain principles.

 
 
 
3.3.2 Different types of party systems in various countries 

There  are  different  types  of  party  systems  functioning  in  our  country. 
Political  parties  function  in  other  countries  too.  Political  parties  are  categorized 
according to the functions of the party system of the country. 

Political Parties 

Single Party 
System 

Bi-Party 
System 

Multi-party 
system 

If  only  one  party 
functions  in  a  country, 
it  has  a  single-party 
system. The party system 
functions 
socialist 
in 
countries is the example. 

e.g. - 
 ² North Korea
 ² Cuba

If 

two  parties 
actively  function  to  get 
the power of a country it 
is called bi-party system. 
Many  other  political 
parties  can  be  seen  in 
these 
countries.  But 
they  are  not  powerful  to 
get  the  power.  Only  two 
major parties function to 
win the power.

e.g. - 
 ² The  United States of 

America

 ² The United Kingdom 

If  more  than  two 
political  parties  function 
in a country, it is called  a 
country  with  multi  party 
system. The main feature 
of  a  country  with  a  
multi-party system is that 
they try to win the power 
by  uniting  with  many 
parties.

e.g. - 
 ² Sri Lanka
 ²
India

3.3.3 Duties of a political party 

 ² Mobilising  the scattered public opinion
 ² Promoting the aims and politics of the party 
 ² Training future leaders
 ² Making the public aware
 ² Respecting democratic political views and opinions of the opponent parties 
 ² Competition with the other parties to win the power of the country
 ² Providing social welfare services

3.3.4 The role of a political party to establish social unity

A large number of people having various kinds of views can be seen in a 
country. The duty of a political party should be to direct them towards a common 
goal. Thereby, a party should not work only to achieve its political goals.

The major responsibility of social development in a country is possessed 
by political parties. Accordingly, some of the functions to be fulfilled by political 
parties are given below:

 ²

Implementing democratic ruling meaningfully based on the national needs 
disregarding religious, ethnic and geographical differences

 ² Creating a basis for all the ethnic groups to exist in a multicultural society 

to enjoy their rights

 ² National development through national unity
 ² Following a policy to refrain from religious and ethnic conflicts
 ² Dedicate  to  establish  sustainable  peace  and  for  living  with  peace, 

co-existance, co-operativity and national unity

3.4 Franchise and elections

3.4.1 Franchise

Franchise  is  the  preference. 
Further,  expressing  one's  opinion 
at  an  election  to  elect  rulers  or 
representatives  is  franchise.  Among 
the rights of a citizen in a democratic 
country, franchise is given a prominent 
place.  The  right  to  elect  people's  representatives  at  an  election  is  regarded  as 
franchise.  

The right to express one's opinion 
at  an  election  to  elect  people's 
representatives and to check public 
opinion is franchise.

In our country, the citizens who complete 18 years of age are entitled legally 

for the franchise. It is necessary to include the name properly in the electoral list.

Given below are some of the reasons for disqualification to be an elector according 
to the constitution of 1978:

If he is disqualified with civic rights
If he is given a life imprisonment
If he is sentenced to death
If he is a named bankrupt by law

3.4.2 Elections

In  a  democratic  governance,  representatives  are  elected  by  the  citizens 
casting their votes. Elections are held to elect people's representatives and to check 
the public opinion on important matters of the country. 

Expressing  one's  vote  is  exercised  in  different  situations.  Through  that, 
electing representatives for government institutions in a democratic society is done. 
Not  only  that  to  obtaining  the  public  opinion  in  relation  to  important  events  of 
the country, to react to that, vote is used. Accordingly, election is the method of 
checking public opinion of democratic countries.

Elections functioning in Sri Lanka at present:
 ² Presidential election 
 ² Parliament election
 ² Provincial Council election 
 ² Election of Local Government Institutions

3.4.3 Universal franchise

Franchise is granted to all qualified citizens to express their right to vote 
in  elections  without  discrimination.  Teacher  of  Civic  Education  inquired  about 
the limited franchise that functioned, before getting the universal franchise in our 
country. 

I  learnt  in  History  that  we  gained  limited  franchise  under  the 
constitutional reforms in 1910. Franchise was given only to the males 
who were above 21 years, educated and rich. 

Damith

That constitutional reform is introduced as Crew Mc Cullum reforms.

A significant feature of the Crew  Mc  Cullum  reforms is the electing 
of  representatives  by  voting  to  the  Legislative  Council  for  the  first 
time. 

Bhagya 

Among  the  unofficial  representatives,  four  had  been  elected  at  the 
limited election. 

Vihanga

At the limited election, two for the Europeans, one for the Burghers 
and one for the educated Sri Lankans had been elected.

Devaki

The  first  Member  of  the  Parliament  elected  was  Sir  Ponnambalam 
Ramanadan on behalf of the educated Sri Lankans.

Vihanga

Well.  You  have  learnt  a  lot  about  the  limited  franchise.  Now  I'll 
explain you how we got the universal franchise.

Teacher

Universal  franchise  was  given  to  the  Sri  Lankan  citizens,  both  males 
and  females,  who  were  above  21  years  of  age  by  the  Donoughmore 
Constitutional Reforms in 1931. Hence the Universal Franchise provided 
basis  for  the  welfare  of  the  citizens.  The  age  limit  for  the  universal 
franchise has been reduced from 21 to 18 years in 1958.

Qualifications required to grant franchise 
 ² Being a citizen of Sri Lanka 
 ² Completion of 18 years of age
 ² Citizen's name should be included in the electoral list 
 ² Being a person not subjected to disfranchise

Factors to be considered when casting the vote 
 ² Electing educated, intelligent and exemplary leaders as representatives
 ² Being alert of policy papers produced before the elections 
 ² Electing  leaders  who  take  care  of  public  expectations  instead  of  having 

personal expectations

 ² Electing leaders who are dedicated to implement national goals and principles

Importance of universal franchise
 ² Getting opportunity to all the citizens who are qualified to cast vote for one's 

political opinion, without any discrepancy
 ² Getting opportunity to elect suitable leaders 
 ² Getting opportunity to all citizens to engage in active politics
 ² Being able to expand political knowledge of the people 
 ² Developing the sense of citizens that they are stake holders of governance
 ² Getting  opportunity  to  elect  rulers  whom  they  like  and  reject  rulers  they 

dislike

3.4.4 Rights of the public related to elections

Election is an opportunity where people participate in governance. Let us 
simply discuss only two strategies of electing representatives at elections. They are 
introduced as representative systems.

 ² Simple Majority Representative system 
 ² Proportional Representative system

There  was  a  discussion  about  the  representative  methods  among  the 
students in the class. Later, they displayed two definitions of their own in front of 
the class. 

Simple  Majority  Representative 
System is electing the candidate who 
won the majority of votes among the 
others of the electoral district.

Proportional  Representative  system 
is  the  comparative  distribution  of 
members  according  to  the  number  of 
votes gained by a party or a group at 
an election. 

Great Britain is an example for a country that holds elections using Simple 
Majority Representation system. Even in our country the same system functioned 
from 1931 - 1978.

Members  for  the  parliament,  provincial  councils  and  Local  Government 

Institutions are elected based on Proportional Representative System. 

The  teacher  in-charge  of  Civic  Education  inquired  about  the  rights  and 
duties of citizens at an election. Based on a group discussion Devni's group came 
up to present a leaflet. 

Rights of citizens related to election

 ²

Inclusion of one's name in the electoral 
list 

 ² Right to vote
 ² Getting the membership  of a political 

party as one wishes

 ² Organising  political  meetings,  taking 
part in them and expressing opinions 

 ² Contesting as a candidate in elections
 ² Engaging 
activities

in  political  propaganda 

 ² Criticizing  the  government  based  on 

fair reasons

Duties of citizens related to election

others' dignity

 ² Respecting others' rights while enjoying 

victory and defeat

3.6 Nation Building 

3.6.1 Introduction to the concept ''Nation Building''

Nation Building is working together with different ethnic groups, religious 
groups or social groups as one nation to achieve development goals facing future 
challenges. It is essential to disregard differences of ethnic, religious, parties, caste 
or creed in nation building.

For an example, in our country people belong to Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim, 
Burgher  live  together.  Further,  they  belong  to  different  religious  groups  such  as 
Buddhists,  Hindus,  Islamics,  Catholics  and  Christians.  Everybody  must  dedicate 
for nation building with a sense of Sri Lankans. 

Need of a national policy for nation building

3.6.2 Introduction to national policy 

A long term action plan prepared in order to achieve the identified national 
development needs, is called as a national policy. It should exclude political party 
differences. The main focus should be the development of the country. Further the 
national policies should be for the betterment of the country, not for the personal 
needs or personal expectations of the rulers. Whatever the government comes to 
power, the national policy should continuously exist further.

the  classroom,  cleaning  the  school  premises,  growing  plants,  proper  garbage 
disposal, etc. in the school. Although they all seem to be minor activities, they 
play a major role in nation building. When small children get together, we can do 
a great contribution to nation building as creating a big river by collecting small 
rain drops.

Introduction

In	 the	 continuity	 of	 our	 daily	 requirements,	 different	 types	 of	 services	
are	needed	to	be	utilized.	Some	of	these	services	are	very	closely	connected	to	
our	lives.	As	such,	they	have	become	essential	services.	Out	of	such	essential	
services,	 health	 and	 sanitation,	 waste	 disposal,	 disease	 control,	 safety,	 secure	
places	to	spend	leisure	peacefully	and	clean	and	safe	roadways	occupy	important	
positions.	Therefore,	the	need	has	arisen	for	a	public	institution	to	mediate	with	
the	supply	of	these	essential	services	to	the	public.

To	 fulfil	 such	 regional	 requirements	 more	 fruitfully	 and	 efficiently,	
special	institutions	established	in	Sri	Lanka	are	introduced	as	Local	Government	
Institutions.	They	function	under	three	categories	now	as	Municipal	Councils,	
Urban	Councils	and	Pradeshiya	Sabhas.	

The	 aim	 of	 this	 chapter	 is	 to	 look	 into	 the	 functions	 of	 these	 Local	

Government	Institutions	broadly.

By	studying	this	chapter	you	get	the	opportunity	to	study	the	followings:

 ² Local	Government	Institutions	and	their	structure
 ² Need	for	Local	Government	Institutions	and	their	services	provided	to	the	

community

 ² Duties	 to	 be	 fulfilled	 by	 the	 public	 for	 the	 maintenance	 of	 such	 services	

effectively

 ² Duties	 to	 be	 fulfilled	 with	 regard	 to	 the	 services	 to	 be	 provided	 by	 the	
public	 representatives	 and	 the	 government	 officers	 attached	 to	 the	 Local	
Government		Institutions

4.1 Local Government Institutions

4.1.1 Identification of Local Government Institutions

It	was	a	holiday.	Achini’s	father	was	reading	the	daily	newspaper.	Achini
came	to	him	with	a	cup	of	tea.	She	looked	at	the	paper	her	father	was	reading.	A	
part	of	their	conversation	is	as	follows:	

Achini

- “Father,	 today’s	 paper	 carries	 a	 lot	 of	 information	 about	 Local	

Government	Institutions,	doesn’t	it?”

Father

- “Ah,	 yes,	 daughter.	 Both	 these	 pages	 describe	 Local	 Government	

Institutions.”

Achini

- “Father,	what	are	these	Local	Government	Institutions?”

Father 

- These	institutions	have	been	set	up	to	ease	the	administration	of	the	

region,	and	to	fullfil	the	needs	of	the	region.

Achini

- That	 means	 these	 institutions	 have	 been	 set	 up	 for	 our	 own	 ease,	

haven't	they?

Father

-

''Yes,	Daughter,	take	your	time	and	read	this	article	leisurely.	You	will	
get	to	know	a	lot	about	Local	Government	Institutions.”

Having read the article published in the newspaper, Achini had summarized 
some important points as given below:   

 ² Local	Government	Institutions	function	under	the	guidance	of	the	Central	Government.
 ² Local	Government	Institutions	in	Sri	Lanka	function	as	Municipal	Councils,	Urban	

Councils	and	Provincial	Councils.

 ² The	 Central	 Government	 has	 assigned	 the	 administrative	 affairs	 to	 the	 Local	

Government	Institutions	through	various	Acts.	

 ² The	 13th	 amendment	 to	 the	 1978	 constitution	 empowers	 the	 Provincial	 Council	 to	

supervise	the	administration	of	the	Local	Government	Institutions.

 ² The	structure	of	a	Local	Government	Institution	consists	of	the	members	elected	by	

the	public	vote	and	of	the	government	officers.

 ² Local	 Government	 Institutions	 are	 bound	 to	 follow	 the	 instructions	 issued	 by	 the	

Central	Government	as	well	as	the	Provincial	Council.

 ² Under	 the	 democratic	 ruling	 system,	 Local	 Government	 Institution	 contribute	 to	
maintain	 the	 administrative	 affairs	 of	 the	 Central	 Government	 more	 easily	 and	 to	
operate	welfare	services	more	closely	to	the	public.

 ² Local	Government	Institutions	provide	an	immense	service	to	regional	development.

to	 maintain	 community	 services,	 easily	 and	 efficiently,	 in	 the	 urban	 
semi	-	urban	and	rural	levels	are	called	Local	Government	Institutions.

4.1.3 Historical evolution of Local Government

Inception	 of	 the	 present	 Local	 Government	 Institutions	 of	 Sri	 Lanka	
commenced	 during	 the	 British	 ruling	 system.	 History	 bears	 evidence	 that	 the	
concept	of	regional	administration	existed	in	Sri	Lanka,	long	ago.		

With	the	introduction	of	a	plantation	economy	by	the	British,	they	needed	to	
develop	infrastructure	(eg:	roads,	exchange	of	messages).	Increase	in	the	population,
urbanization	and	the	increase	in	the	provision	of	social	benefits	to	the	public,	were	
the	other	reasons	contributed	towards	to	form	formal	Local	Government	Institutions	
during	British	period.	

As	such,	the	regulations	brought	in	by	the	British,	affect	the	birth	of	Local	

Government	Institutions	and	their	gradual	development.		

Some regulations brought in by the British are as follows:

 ² Establishment	of	Municipal	Councils	in	1865	A.D.	in	Colombo,	Kandy	and	

Galle	under	the	Municipal	Council	Ordinance	No.	17

 ² Establishment	 of	Village	 Councils	 in	 1871	A.D.	 under	 the	Village	 Council	

Ordinance	No.	26	

 ² Establishment	 of	 Town	 Councils	 in	 1940	 A.D.	 under	 the	 Town	 Council	

Ordinance	No.	61

 ² Establishment	of	Urban	Councils	in	1946	AD	under	the	Ordinance	No.	03

4.5 Contribution of the Local Government Institutions towards  
      the national development

The	utmost	result	of	a	regional	development	process	is	the	social,	economic
and	cultural	development	of	a	country	which	takes	place	as	the	overall	development.	
Maintaining	a	balance	with	the	environment	is	essential	in	the	implementation	of		
all	development	activities.	Regional	development	is	directly	associated	with	Local	
Government	 Institutions.	A	 few	 examples	 regarding	 contributions	 from	 regional	
development	towards	national	development	are	listed	below;

i.				Identifying	regional	needs	and	the	resources
ii.	 Preparation	 of	 regional	 development	 plans	 through	 identifying	 the 
						regional	needs	and	the	resources
iii.		Implementing	plans	properly	
iv.		Producing	regional	leaders

A	short	description	about	each	topic	is	given	below:

i. Identifying regional needs and the resources

The	needs	of	people	that	differ	according	to	the	place	they	live	in	are	called	

regional	needs.	The	following	contribute	to	vary	the	requirements	of	regions:

 ² Distribution of resources
 ² Variety	in	culture
 ² Geographical	background

Therefore,	it	is	a	strong	responsibility	of	a	Local	Government	Institution	to	
identify	the	requirements	for	each	region.	A	few	examples	related	to	regional	needs	
are	given	below:

 ² Providing	drinking	water	to	those	living	in	a	dry	zone	region	
 ² Proper	waste	disposal	and	management	in	the	Urban	areas
 ² Development	of	infrastructure	in	rural	areas
 ² Providing	recreational	facilities	to	both	urban	and	rural	areas	(library	services,	

playgrounds,	roadways	for	walking,	children’s	playgrounds,	etc.)

 ² Providing	houses	to	low	income	groups
 ² Street	lighting
 ² Maintaining	pre-schools	to	develop	little	children
 ² Taking	steps	to	control	the	spread	of	dengue	in	affected	areas.

iii. Proper implementation of plans 

It	 is	 the	 responsibility	 of	 representatives	 of	 the	 people	 and	 government	
officers	 in	 Local	 Government	 Institutions	 to	 see	 that	 these	 programmes	 meet
expected	 outcomes.	 	At	 the	 same	 time,	 good	 supervision	 with	 such	 programmes	
will	help	provide	better	services	to	the	community.

Examples:

 ² Supervision	of	regional	road	constructions/repairs	to	ensure	the	proper	standards.
 ² Supervise	to	see	whether	both	garbage	collectors	and	the	public	keep	to	their	
duties	properly	in	the	management	of	garbage	and	when	necessary	they	must	
be	given	advice.

iv. Producing regional leaders 

The	main	factor	to	the	success	of	a	democratic	system	of	government	is	an	
honest,	efficient	and	noble	political	leadership.		Regarding	the	regional	administration	
in	a	democratic	system	of	a	government,	Local	Government	Institutions	which	are	
given	authority	are	also	very	closely	attached	to	the	public.	Therefore,	people	who	
live	in	that	area	has	a	right	to	elect	exemplary	political	leaders	of	the	region	with	
democratic	qualities	as	the	representations	of	Local	Government	Institutions.	This	
is	a	very	important	responsibility	the	public	enjoys.

Representatives,	 elected	 in	 that	 manner,	 need	 to	 do	 their	 work	 devotedly		
towards	 the	 public	 they	 serve	 to	 acquire	 knowledge	 about	 politics,	 experience	
and	 training.	 	Introducing	 such	 remarkable	 leaders	 to	 national	 politics	 is	 a	 very	
important	national	service.

Following	these	procedures,	Local	Government	Institutions	can	contribute	

immensely	to	build	up	a	prosperous	Sri	Lanka.

the	spread	of	Dengue	in	your	home	garden/	school.

3.	 Present	 your	 suggestions	 to	 manage	 garbage	 collected	 around

Introduction

Society	consists	of	a	large	number	of	people.	They	differ	from	one	another.	
Such	 differences	 occur	 as	 a	 result	 of	 the	 differences	 of	 their	 opinions,	 beliefs,	
education	and	economy.	In	fact	conflicts	occur	constantly	due	to	such	differences.	
As	a	result	of	conflicts	there	can	be	mental	disturbances,	stress,	worries,	violence	
and	 harmful	 social	 activities.	 Conflicts	 may	 occur	 within	 a	 person,	 among	
people,	families,	regions,	countries	as	well	as	internationally.	It	is	very	important	
to	 resolve	 such	 conflicts	 peacefully	 for	 the	 existence	 of	 human	 society	 and	 to	
maintain sustainable peace in the society.

Defining conflicts

Given	below	are	some	of	the	views	taken	from	a	brain	storming	activity	related	to	
the	lesson	''Conflicts'':

Conflicts 
occur due to impatience

conflicts occur not 
only among humans but also 

among animals

Conflicts 
occur due to the 

influence of external people

Conflicts 
occur due to vicious 

qualities such as anger, jealousy 

Conflicts occur due 
to our various beliefs as well as 

doubts within us 

conflicts 
occur as a result of 
diversity in thoughts

Not respecting 
others mutually is the cause for 

conflicts

Conflicts 
are created for getting 

resources and spreading ones 
power

Yes, children, your ideas are very important. Let’s see 
how to define a conflict.

Defining conflicts

“A	 situation	 in	 which	 people,	 group	 or	 countries	 are	 involved	 in	 a	 serious	
disagreement or argument”

 Oxford dictionary

It	 is	 clear	 that	 a	 conflict	 occurs	 in	 various	 forms	 such	 as	 riot,	 quarrel,	

disagreement,	argument,	hitting	or	war.	

Everybody	has	to	face	various	types	of	conflicts	in	day	to	day	life.	Conflicts	
can	 occur	 within	 a	 person,	 among	 friends,	 relatives	 and	 neighbours.	 There	 can	
be	conflicts	among	ethnic	groups,	political	parties	as	well	as	religious	groups.	As	
a	result	of	resolving	conflicts	in	a	positive	manner,	there	can	be	new	ideas,	new	
creations	and	new	relations.

If	the	conflicts	are	not	resolved	at	the	beginning,	it	will	lead	to	a	harmful	
condition.	In	fact	it	is	important	to	resolve	conflicts	at	the	beginning	otherwise	it	
may	destroy	valuable	human	lives	as	well	as	the	properties.

5.1 Causes for conflicts

Not being 
socialized

Selfishness

Being	invade

Being 
Uneducated

Desire to gain 
power

Causes for

resources

Social 
differences

Being highly 
sensitive

 ²

Remind	an	instance	where	you	had	to	face	a	conflict.	Line	up	the	 
reasons for that one by one. 

 ² Write	preventive	steps	that	could	have	been	taken	to	resolve	that 

conflict.	

Parties involved in conflicts

 ² Within one self 
 ² Between	two	people	
 ² Within a family 
 ² Among neighbours (among people/families/groups of people) 
 ² Within	one	State	or	between	two	States
 ² Among many States

Various conflicts 

Conflicts	in	the	country	can	be	categorized	according	to	the	nature	of	them.

Examples	-	

 ² Conflicts based on politics

	 Conflicts	 related	 to	 boundaries	 can	 be	 cited	 as	
examples.	There	are	conflicts	between	India	and	
Kashmeer for a long time.

 ² Conflicts based on economy 

These	conflicts	are	created	due	to	many	economic	reasons	such	as	obtaining	
resources,	 poverty,	 capturing	 the	 market	 or	 broadening	 market.	 The	 conflict	
between	Irac	and	Quate	for	mineral	oil	can	be	cited	as	examples.	

 ² Conflict based on society

	 Conflicts	created	due	to	various	opinion	among	people/group	of	people/among	

countries/religious	groups	or	racial	groups	are	some	examples.

Write	an	article	to	a	newspaper	about	the	danger	of	the	conflicts	of	
the	world	to	the	human	society.

5.2 Issues arising in conflict resolution

There	 can	 be	 various	 issues	 when	 resolving	 conflicts.	 Some	 examples	 are	 given	
below:

 ² Rigidity
 ² Stick	to	one’s	opinion
 ² Stick	to	one’s	solution
 ² Not	seeking	alternatives
 ² No	involvement	of	all	the	parties	in	conflict	resolution
 ² Thinking	of	winning	by	defeating	others
 ² One	party	is	trying	to	win	ignoring	the	opinion	and	needs	of	the	other	parties

The	major	issue	of	conflict	resolution	is	the	rigidity	of	both	parties	involved	

in	the	conflict.	The	story	given	below	tells	us	such	situation:

Amindu	and	kavindu	are	Grade	9	students.	They	are	classmates.	Teacher	
wanted	to	appoint	a	monitor.	Both	Amindu	and	Kavindu	wanted	to	be	the	monitor.	
But	the	teacher	said	that	only	one	could	be	the	monitor	the	other	could	be	the	vice.	
But	both	of	them	wanted	to	get	the	leadership	and	they	stuck	to	that	opinion.	As	a	
result	teacher	was	unable	to	appoint	a	monitor.	

Major	obstacle	for	conflict	resolution	is	that	they	stick	to	one	opinion.	The	

story	given	below	proves	that:

Sandakirani	 and	 Prabashvara	 are	 siblings.	 One	 day	 there	 was	 a	 conflict	
situation	over	a	TV	programme.	One	liked	to	watch	a	cartoon	and	the	other	
liked	to	watch	a	cricket	match.	Both	tried	to	watch	their	programme	at	once.	
There,	a	conflict	occurred.	Father	resolved	the	conflict	at	the	end.

Conflicts	occur	at	different	levels	as	parties	that	involved	in	conflicts	stick	

to	one	option,

Another	cause	for	conflicts	is	that	they	do	not	seek	alternatives,	they	will	be	

able	to	solve	the	problems	easily.

 ² Watching	programmes	in	different	periods
 ² Watching	programmes	a	week	after	week
 ² Watching programmes using the internet
 ² Watching another programme during that time 

Activity 5.3

Select	a	country	or	a	party	that	leads	to	conflicts.	Study	it	and	discuss	
the	obstacles	of	conflict	resolution.

Qualities needed for conflict resolution

 ² Patience
 ² Active listening
 ² Kindness
 ² Friendliness
 ² Ability to make decisions
 ² Expressive ability
 ² Controlling emotions  

 ² Respecting other's views
 ² Generosity
 ² Unbiased nature
 ² Respecting every body
 ² Fair judgement
 ² Respecting rights
 ² Fulfilling duties 

Suitable methods of conflict resolution

There	 are	 many	 accepted	 methods	 of	 conflict	 resolution.	 Some	 examples	

are	given	below:

122

Discussion

The	 most	 simple	 method	 of	 conflict	 resolution	 is	 discussion.	 Conflict	
resolution	 is	 done	 by	 the	 parties	 involved	 through	 discussions.	 There,	 the	 both	
parties	can	succeed	in	coming	to	“win	–	win”	solution.

Involvement

Involvement	is	used	to	assist	two	persons	or	two	groups	or	two	countries	
to	settle	a	conflict	when	the	discussion	method	is	failed.	This	is	a	peaceful	process.	
Persons	who	are	accepted	by	both	parties	or	external	parties	can	be	used	for	this	
purpose.
Situations	where	involvement	can	be	used:

 ² Family	conflicts
 ² Among groups of students
 ² Among ethnic groups
 ² Among countries

Mediation

Mediation	can	be	introduced	as	another	method	of	resolving	a	conflict	of	
disagreement.	 Conciliation	 is	 done	 by	 a	 board	 consists	 of	 mediators.	 The	 main	
feature	of	mediation	is	that	both	the	parties	leading	towards	discussion	to	resolve	
their	 conflicts.	 The	 Mediation	 Boards	 have	 been	 established	 by	 the	 Ministry	 of	
Justice for Mediation.

Examples	for	some	conflicts	that	can	be	resolved	by	Mediation	Boards	are	given	
below;

 ² Family	conflicts
 ² Minor	offences
 ² Conflicts	among	groups	of	people

Inquiry

Inquiry	is	a	judiciary	process.	The	parties	involved	in	the	conflict	are	advised	
to	come	to	a	settlement	at	first	and	if	it	fails,	the	conflict	is	settled	by	a	legal	inquiry.	
The	verdict	of	the	judiciary	is	final	and	the	loser	can	appeal	to	a	higher	court	of	law.	

Counselling

Counseling	 is	 directing	 towards	 conflict	 resolution	 by	 giving	 advice	 and	
guiding,	while	providing	facilities	in	various	ways.	Here	making	two	parties	aware	
of	 benefits	 of	 positive	 conflict	 resolution	 and	 the	 consequences	 of	 conflicts,	 and	
directing	them	to	mitigate	the	conflicts	are	done.

Activity 5.4

Observe	how	Mediation	Board	in	your	area	resolves	a	conflict.	Then	
prepare	a	short	report	on	conflict	resolution.			

5.3 Advantages of positive conflict resolution

The	 members	 brings	 up	 in	 such	 environment	 also	 exhibit	 unrest	 and	
violence.	Therefore,	resolving	family	conflicts	then	and	there	results	peace	at	home	
as	well	as	in	the	society.	

Many	 countries	 and	 social	 groups	 conflicts	 each	 other	 nationally	 and	
internationally	 due	 to	 racial,	 religious,	 civil	 wars	 etc.	 It	 is	 important	 to	 resolve	
conflicts	positively	avoiding	loss	of	life	and	property	and	being	refugees.

Establishment of peace

Some	advantages	of	positive	conflict	resolution	are	given	below:

 ² Establishment of peace -	Whenever	a	conflict	occurs,	peace	breaks.	When	a	
conflict	occurs	in	mind,	internal	peace	breaks.	In	the	some	way	that	the	conflicts	
occur	between	two	people,	among	people,	in	the	family	among	different	people	
in	the	society	break	peace.	Resolving	conflicts	in	a	positive	manner	establishes	
peace.	 In	 fact	 positive	 conflict	 resolution	 is	 essential	 for	 the	 establishment	
of	 peace.	 This	 is	 important	 for	 oneself	 personally	 as	 well	 as	 for	 the	 society	
commonly. 

 ² Personal and social development -	Conflicts	always	bring	personal	and	social	
deterioration	 of	 development.	 In	 fact	 positive	 conflict	 resolution	 causes	 for	
personal	and	social	development.

 ² Political  stability  -	 Generally	 conflicts	 damage	 the	 political	 stability	 of	 a	
country.	The	state	of	political	instability	has	severe	negative	impact	on	a	country.	
In	fact	positive	conflict	resolution	causes	for	political	stability.

 ² Minimizing  waste  of  resources  -	 Large	 amount	 of	 resources	 waste	 due	 to	
conflicts.	There	is	a	waste	of	physical,	human	resources	and	time.	Hence	it	is	
very	important	to	have	positive	conflict	resolution	for	minimizing	or	avoiding	
wastage	of	resources.

Some	 more	 advantages	 of	 positive	 conflict	 resolution	 are	 given	 below.	

Discuss	these	factors	with	the	teacher.

 ² Confidence	building
 ² Minimizing mental stress
 ² Safeguard personal respect
 ² Building friendliness
 ² Developing	social	relations
 ² Developing	cultural	integrity
 ² Protection	of	human	rights	specially	child	rights	and	women	rights
 ² Avoiding	damages	of	lives/	property
 ² Widening of international relations
 ²
Increasing	the	arrival	of	investors

Consequences of not resolving conflicts positively 

As	not	resolving	conflicts	positively,	there	is	a	negative	impact	on	people	as	
well	as	society.	Consequences	of	not	solving	conflicts	using	win	-	win	method	are	
given	below:

 ² Mental stress
 ² Being unpopular
 ² Having	mutual	suspicion	and	distrust
 ² Breaking	down	social	relations
 ²
 ² Destruction of resources
 ² Breaking	down	in	peace

Increasing	unnecessary	problems	and	expenditure	

Widen	your	knowledge	by	discussing	the	above	factors	with	your	teacher,	friends	
and elders.

Positive	conflict	resolution	is	equally	important	for	all	the	parties	involved.	
Advantages	of	positive	conflict	resolution	can	be	considered	as	common	factors	
for	 everybody.	At	 the	 same	 time	 the	 consequences	 of	 not	 resolving	 conflicts	
positively	can	have	negative	impact	on	all	the	parties.	In	fact	the	parties	involved	
should	do	positive	conflict	resolution	honestly	and	dedicatedly.	By	now	you	have	
understood	the	impact	on	personal	development	as	well	as	social	development.	
Positive	conflict	resolution	causes	for	social	peace	and	harmony	not	only	that	it	
helps	to	develop	social	co-existence,	reconciliation,	brotherhood	and	freedom.	
By	means	of	that,	the	way	is	paved	for	the	entire	social	peace.	Children,	let’s	
forget all the disagreements and stand for peace. That is our duty today.

6.1 Maintaining a personal profile

The figure below makes clear that there is a social as well as personal value 

of every job or career.

Jobs/careers in the world of work

Before you consider a job, it is important to evaluate your own capabilities, 
skills and preference. You may have different talents. You are the only person who 
is well aware of them. In the selection of a field of career, your own choice will 
be more important than one selected under the influence of the others. Therefore, 
maintaining a personal profile, including your personal qualities, skills and desires 
will be useful in search of a job in future.

When  the  teacher  inquired  the  children  about  the  things  that  should  be 

included in a personal profile, the following are some answers given by them; 

Saman

Have you seen some indigenous physicians treating free of charge? They 
value self-satisfaction more than money. Even in paid occupations if we work with 
pleasure, without limiting our service to money, it will be beneficial to the country, 
as well as to you.

For continuous existence of society, it is essential to supply various Jobs and 
services. Therefore, every job is important to the society equally. Every employment 
has some value and dignity and acceptance at a high or low level. As some think, it 
is not suitable to categorize employments as high ranking or low, the reason being 
that every job is equally required by the society. It is clear that some are tempted to 
categorize occupations on the basis of quantity of labour spent, expected income 
or  social  status.  But  you  may  realize  that  such  categorization  is  not  suitable  or 
necessary. 

Activity 6'2

6.3 Pathways for different employments

There are different pathways to enter a profession or an occupation. It should 
be  selected  to  suit  and  realize  future  hopes  and  goals. Thereby  your  educational 
activities can be easily planned to suit the world of work. Your personal abilities, 
preferences and skills should be considered. Some examples for such occasions are 
given below:

 ² Selection of subject streams in the school

You who are studying in Grade 9 this year will enter Grade 10 next year. 
There are six core-subjects and three basket subjects for you to select. On such an 
occasion, there are some facts to be considered. For example, your ability to study 
those subjects, desire and the connection with the future world of work are some of 

132

133

them. Similarly, when selecting basket subjects, whatever the job you aim at, 
special attention should be paid on Civic Education, a subject, which develops 
attitudes, skills and knowledge to live as a good citizen. The reasons for that is 
at present, or in future, in whatever job you are engaged in, value of humanity 
stands above all.

Having passed the G. C. E. Ordinary Level examination, when you go to the 
G. C. E. Advanced Level class, there are some streams like Science, Mathematics, 
Vocational/Technical subjects, Commerce and Arts. In such a situation, selection of 
the stream and subjects should be done to your expectations.

6.4 Required qualifications and experience for jobs professions

 ²

Importance of selecting subject streams for jobs

Qualifications alone are not sufficient to do a job or a profession. For that, it 
is important to have experience too. Specially for professions like medical and law, 
it is compulsory to complete prior experience.

Specially  as  students,  it  is  very  important  for  you  to  select  the  subject 
stream to suit your career pathway. An extract from a speech made by a speaker, 
at a workshop held for students who have passed G. C. E. O/L examination in the 
selection of subject stream, is given below:

''You  are  now  getting  ready  to  overcome  the  second  step.  But,  for  that,  it  is 
important to select suitable subjects and suitable streams. First think of the job  
you are going to do in future. For example, if you wish to seek a job in the field 
of banking, what subject stream should you select? Isn't it the commerce stream 
that you should select?

Mentioned above is only one fact. In addition to that, what are the things that should 
be considered when selecting a subject stream?

1. Whether the subject streams suit your skills

2. What are the other educational and training courses that could be followed 

through those subject streams?

3. Whether  there  are  chances  for  higher  education  through  the  selected 

subject stream?

4. Whether  there  is  a  possibility  to  pursue  studies  in  the  selected  subject 

stream in your school?

5. What  would  be  the  job  opportunities  in  future  on  the  selected  subject 

stream?

If you can answer these questions successfully, you will be able to enter the 
world of work diligently in future. It will be clear to you that many students of the 
present day, select subject streams on the wish of the parents, as the other students 
do the same subjects or they can go to an urban school. So, can you see in society 
that there are many who fail examinations and unable to face life successfully?

Nimal 

- Teacher, are there any other needs to consider when selecting 

jobs?

Teacher 

- Yes,  Nimal,  besides  subject  streams,  there  are  many  other 
things.  One  is  academic,  timely,  emotional  and  physical 
demand

Thamara 

- What does that mean teacher?

later it may require a degree instead.

It means to do a job, there should be a good mental readiness 
and a good physical fitness. If physically disabled, a driver's 
job cannot be done. Can he?
Ok,  did  you  understand  now?  Then,  when  you  go  home  
today, refer to some papers and scrutinize job advertisements. 
Write down academic qualifications for five jobs.

- Teacher, is it necessary to have a special experience for jobs?

- Yes, to be a teacher, a special training is necessary. A relevant 
degree and a professional training is essential. For example, 
we can cite training in a College of Education or Post Graduate 
Diploma. For the job of a driver, it needs a special experience. 
For  occupations  like  motor  vehicle  repairing,  house-wiring, 
medical profession, a practical training is made compulsory. 
Further, a different exceptional courses also can be followed. 
For instance a clerk can follow a Computer Science Course 
and earn additional income.

Have  you  seen  advertisements  published  for  jobs?  Newspapers,  gazette 
notifications,  Internet,  and  websites  are  mostly  used  as  media  for  this  purpose. 
Other than those banners and notices and handbills are also used. 

In the past, the easiest way of getting vocational training was from family 

members. Agriculture, fishing and carpentry are examples.

A child doing carpentry work with 
father

A child doing agriculture with father 

You  also  may  have  similar  experiences.  You  too  can  get  vocational 
training  and  knowledge  from  the  employments  of  the  family  members.  It  does 
not  mean  that  the  same  job  of  parents  should  be  followed.  But  you  can  get  the 
initial training and valuable experience by that, to do a job. Also you will have the  
self-esteem of your capability to do something. 

It may be clear to you now educational qualifications and experience have 

equal importance in doing a job.

application form.

 ² How to fill a job application 

Sometimes, a model application form for a job is supplied along with the 
advertisement. Some application forms can be bought from the market. Similarly, 
in some job advertisements, instructions are given to send an application written in 
one's own hand-writing. In such an instance, it is quite essential to prepare a rough 
copy  of  the  job  application.  Let  us  first  see  the  importance  of  preparing  such  a 
rough copy of the job application.  

Importance of 
filing in a rough 
copy of an

Activity 6.6

An  advertisement  was  published  in  a  weekend  newspaper  regarding 
vacancies of masons in a work site of State Engineering Cooperation. 
Prepare  a  letter  to  apply  for  the  above  post. Act  a  role  play  a  mock 
interview for that.

6.8 Developing of interview skills

After applying for a job, the next-step is to face an interview, when called for.

An interview is a verbal test, conducted by the employer to examine 
your suitability for enrolment to the expected job/occupation.

 ² Ways of conducting interviews 

There are 3 types of interviews conducted to select for jobs.

I.  Individual interview

Head of the institution himself questions the candidate verbally. Interviews 
of this nature are conducted, specially in the private sector to enroll workers for 
business enterprises, garment factories owned by a single person.

These  interviews  are  held  to  enroll  workers  for  government  and  large 
scale private sector institutions. Generally there can be two or more persons in the 
interview board. When selecting for high level occupations, there can be about five 
people seen in the interview board.

III.  Practical interview

Sometimes  for  jobs  that  need  to  test  practical  skills,  practical  tests  are 
conducted  in  addition  to  verbal  interviews.  Specially  in  the  case  of  computers, 
jobs in the technical field and music and dancing, practical tests are conducted. At 
present at the recruitment of teachers also, practical tests are conducted.

 ²

Importance of developing interview skills

It is essential to face interviews with a prior preparation. It is great to be 
successful at the interview, when a number of persons participate in the interview, 
for the same job, with equal qualifications as yours. If you can face successfully, 
you will be able to get a job and if you fail, you will live without a job for a long 
time. 

To  face  an  interview  successfully,  Charlie  Marshalls  2016  has  indicated 

some procedures to follow:

 ² Wear a formal dress properly. It is not suitable to go in a simple dress. Your 

dress should show your personality and an attractive look.

 ² Take an additional bio-data sheet, a note book, a pen and other necessary 

things

 ² Do a rehearsal
 ² Get a good knowledge of the institution that you go for the interview
 ² Work to scheduled time. Go to the relevant place of interview early. 
 ² Do not argue or be critical with the interviewer or the board.
 ² Answer the questions frankly, honestly and not in a debatable manner.
 ² During the time of interview, show your politeness and learnedness.
 ² Never boast of yourself over the limit. Try to be you yourself.
 ²
If you had been employed earlier, never express condemnation statements.
 ² During  the  time  of  interview,  maintain  your  body  language  and  speech 

positively. 

When facing an interview, it is natural for any person to be stressful or be 
excited. A  proper  training  will  minimize  stress  and  enable  to  face  the  interview 
successfully.

6.9 Importance of facing an interview well

The  perception  formed  about  you  at  the  interview  will  stand  important  a 
long way. How qualified you are, your selection or rejection will be decided on  the 
way you face the interview. 

The following are some instructions given by the teacher in charge of Civic 

Education to a group of students, how to face an interview successfully.

- Sir, our brother is scared because he has an interview tomorrow.
- Needn't to be scared when you learn how to face an interview, 

it will be ok. 

- How is it sir? Please tell us.

- The first thing is our personal appearance 
- What's the personal appearance sir?

- When we appear for an interview, our dress, the way of the 

hair cut, our make-up etc.
It is not good to do too much of make-up. Isn't it, sir?

-

- Quite right Rajini. You must be simple and charming. Then 

only the interviewers will be pleased
- What are the other important things sir?
- Wait. I'll tell you. Look at this poster.

Factors that should be considered when appearing for an interview
       - Personal appearance 

  ²  Do your hair in a suitable way
  ²  Make up
  ²  Dress

      - Body Language

 ²  Maintaining a good rapport with the interview board
      ²  Require a training to win the attention of the interview board in a  
     disciplined way
 ²  Pay attention and reply directly to questions of the interview board
 ²  Appear before the interview board diligently and without laziness     

       - Speech and use of language

 ²  To speak clearly and audible enough to be heard by the interview board 
  ²  Using the language politely and courteously

        - Being courteous 

 ²  When entering and leaving the place where interview is held, behave  
     politely 
  ²  Address respectfully and be disciplined when taking seat and leaving 
  ²  Answer the questions of the interview board respectfully and politely 
  ²  Behave before the interview board respectfully

An interview is a competitive stage. Sometimes 10 or 15 candidates may 
appear  for  the  same  job.  Here,  if  you  wish  to  get  a  better  place  over  the  others, 
you should face the situation in a good manner. Whatever certificates you possess, 
perhaps another with less educational qualifications may get the job as he or she 
faced the interview successfully. 

Activity 6.8

"Write an essay on "if you want to pass the interview" suitable to be 
published in a newspaper.

6.10 Proper time management

cultivating efficiency and productivity  ²  proper time management  ²  accurate 
finance management  ²  personal behaviour  ²  maintenance of balance between 
occupation and personal life. 

Out of the above skills, the most important is the time management, because 
the value of time is a resource. There is an old saying, "Time is golden" to show the 
value of time. To make activities in the job to be successful, time should be divided 
according to the work. That is Time Management.

A person can divide one's time into three parts as given below; 

Personal time 

Time for work 

Time for studies

Time to be spent for personal affairs is introduced 
like  this.  It  should  be  used  apart  from  time  of 
duty.

Time  you  have  to  spend  to  work  in  the  office 
or  work  site  is  called  this.  In  Sri  Lanka,  it  is 
considered as eight hours.

Time  allocated  for  training  and  completion  of 
qualifications  is  called  this.  Sometimes  leave 
is  granted  by  the  institutions  and  directed  for 
educational activities.

As the employers always pay their attention on efficiency and productivity, Time 
Management is highly important.

Efficiency: using limited resources to the maximum

Productivity: achieving initially planned aims in the same way

If time is not managed properly, it is difficult to gain efficiency and productivity.

Concern of the employer on productivity and efficiency

 ²

It  is  the  expectation  of  every  employer  to  maintain  productivity  and 
efficiency in his institution.

 ² Therefore, it is the right of employers to expect a service from the employees, 

in return for money and other facilities offered to them.

 ² So that the employee should consider it as his right and his duty to do the 

 ²

service without any reluctance.
If these duties are well performed, institutions can reach productivity and 
efficiency very easily.

This story is told of an unannounced visit by John F. Kennedy to the 
space center at Cape Canaveral in the mid 1960s. Kennady toured the 
complex and met a man “What do you do here?” he asked. The man 
replied,  “I’m  earning  a  living.”  Kennady  nodded  and  moved  on.  He 
met  another  man  and  asked  the  same  question.  “I  clean  away  all  the 
rabbish” the man said. Kennady smiled and strode on until he met another man 
and put the same question again. This time a big smile came across the face of the 
man who replied, “My President, I am helping to put a man on the moon.” 

When  you  employ  in  an  institute,  you  should  have  a  wide  intention  to 
achieve the broad vision of the institute more the little work you do for it, or the 
wage that you obtain for it.

6.11 Maintaining personal behaviour

In an institution there are people engaged in different levels of occupations. 
Therefore,  it  is  essential  to  maintain  your  personal  conduct  well  in  the  place  of 
work.  We  must  keep  in  mind  that  behavioural  problems  of  a  person  will  have 
adverse effects on the others too. 

The chart below shows some facts to consider regarding personal behaviour:

Respecting every designation 
of the institution

Maintaining a sound 
communication

Treating employees in a 
friendly manner

Characteristics 
of meticulous 
personal conduct/
behaviour 

Working with maximum 
dedication

Not taking leave unnecessarily 

Performing your 
responsibilities properly

When  the  institution  has  faced  some  difficult  situations,  all  should  work 

collectively and protect from such adverse conditions. 

It is the responsibility of every employee to maintain his own behaviour in 

and out of the institution, to protect its dignity. 

In  addition  to  this,  there  are  a  few  behavioural  patterns  to  be  followed  by  the 
employees;
 ² To behave in such a way that your behaviour may not harm or bring dishonour 

to the others

 ² Adjust your behaviour in order to achieve the objectives of the institution
 ² Report for work on time
 ² Not to delay work unnecessarily
 ² Offer your service to the institution voluntarily at times of need
 ² Work to use the resources to the maximum
 ² Not to harm the good name of the institution

The  behaviour  of  the  employee  directly  influences  the  good  name  of  the 
institution. Personal behaviour of every individual affects the activities of others 
and on their behaviour itself positively or negatively. 

To be drunk on while on duty, chewing betel, smoking, malpractices, getting 
bribes,  keeping  away  from  place  of  work  unnecessarily  and  engaging  in 
corruptions will bring dishonour to the institution. 

Specially  to  report  for  work  on  time,  engage  in  work  during  working 
hours and leaving on time are important. To systematize attendance, most of the 
institutions have introduced marking the card and placing finger print instead of 
the signature book. One should be mindful the behaviour outside the working place 
too.

6.12 Proper personal financial management

 ²

Income and expenditure

It  is  necessary  for  any  person  to  have  some  income  to  live.  For  that,  to 
engage in some occupation or profession is essential. If not, he must have some 
other way of getting an income such as subsidies or donations.

Spending money in normal or emergency situations

As there can be instances where one has to allocate money for day to day 

activities, as well as at emergencies, one must possess enough money. 

 ² Opening and maintaining bank account

In utilizing money, maintaining a bank account, makes day to day financial 
transactions  easy,  provides  financial  security  and  an  extra  income.  Obtaining  an 
interest  monthly  or  annually  from  a  fixed  deposit  in  a  bank  can  be  cited  as  an 
example. Through which personal financial management too, takes place.

to following reasons:

If there is a break down in earning under the expected conditions of income

 ² Becoming a long-time debtor 
 ² Charging high annual fees

 
 
 
 
 The  main  problem  specially  when  using  credit  cards  without  a  limit  for 
services and goods is that we inescapably become long-term debtors to credit card 
companies.

The use of credit cards is suitable for busy people with a permanent income, 
for  systematic  payment  of  water  and  electricity  bills.  Those  who  are  not  frugal 
in  spending  and  heavily  in  debts,  without  a  permanent  income,  will  face  more 
problems by the use of credit cards.

 ²

Investing or saving for future

It means that the investing or saving money for future business or for making 

personal life successful.

Example: Investing in business, Investing in fixed deposits
The pension or the provident fund rights at old age should be managed and 

utilised with a good management very carefully.

If you are engaged in a job where no pension or provident fund or other 
benefits are given, it is important to manage savings and finance in a methodical 
way for the future. 

Similarly,  it  is  important  that  we  should  save  some  money  for  the  future 
from  the  income  we  derive  from  the  occupation.  When  it  happens  to  leave  the 
job or go on retirement, the money, thus saved could be made use of. In an urgent 
necessity of money this saving could be used as for a loan. If employed in a job with 
no pension, this saving could be used for future investment.

It is important to spend the money derived from the pension or Employees' 
Provident  Fund  in  a  balanced  way.  Specially  when  you  are  without  a  job,  your 
value also depreciates. In such an instance, if this money is invested properly to get 
an additional income, you will be able to lead a happy life of retirement. At present, 
banks have made arrangements on the savings of senior citizens to offer a higher 
rate of interest and special concessions.

6.13 Maintaining a balance between work and personal life

It  is  very  important  to  keep  balance  between  work  and  personal  life,  not 
allowing problems to arise. When work and personal life are entangled with each 
other,  both  occupation  and  life  will  be  bitter.  Leaving  for  home  after  finishing 
duties of the job in the office itself, we can have a successful personal life. To work 
over time to earn more than what is required, and to engage in additional activities 
make  the  personal  life  problematic.  Spending  a  few  hours  with  family  together, 
is necessity. Household activities, educational activities of children, taking meals 
together,  engage  in  pleasure  trips,  engage  in  sports,  participation  in  religious 
activities and engaging in social service and family affairs will promote physical 
and mental health.

As  well  giving  preference  to  personal  life,  neglecting  professional  work

Financial difficulties can be regarded as a main cause for professional and 
family problems. Financial problems arise due to excessive spending of income. It 
is essential to control unnecessary and extra expenses to manage with the income. 
When financial difficulties arise, attention should be drawn to get assistance from  
close friends. You can borrow money from parents or friends. If you are used to 
credit cards or to borrow on interest, the problems will aggravate and will never be 
able to get rid of it. Planned or systematic management raises the efficiency and 
productivity of the institution, whereby the employer is  benefited. It paves the way 
for a successful personal life. Money is needed for life, but it is important to bear in 
mind that money is not life.

A Word to the Teacher.....

The Boards of Writers and Editors are honoured to be a part of this 
national  endeavour to write  and edit the Grade  09 English textbook and 
workbook  for  the  students  of  this  country.  The  textbook  is  designed  to 
help the students to learn and use language in different situations locally 
and internationally. The book also contains additional information for the 
teachers in the form of competency levels and the corresponding activities 
with the hope of making the task of teaching easier. Furthermore, the book 
is	designed	to	accommodate	the	different	and	varying	proficiency	levels	of	
the students with the hope of addressing the needs of the larger student 
population  of  this  country.  In  addition,  the  lessons  are  chronologically 
sequenced to avoid any confusion that may arise in the teaching process. 

It is recommended that this book be used as a guide to the teachers 
and  the  students  on  the  expected  national  standards,  and  teachers  are 
encouraged  to  use  supplementary  material  as  much  as  possible  in  the 
classroom. We thank all those who worked with us and hope that we will 
be able to make a difference in the lives of our students who are keen and 
enthusiastic to learn English.

Collective Nouns

When we use a collective noun, we can use either a singular or a 
plural verb. The choice depends on whether we see the group as 
a whole or as a number of individual members.

We use a singular verb if the group acts as a single unit, and a 
plural verb when the members of the group act as a number of 
individuals.
e.g. :- 

1) There was quite a large audience. 
 (The audience seen as a unit)
  2) The audience were already clapping their hands. 
Here is a list of common collective nouns.

manufacturers to produce goods to match the needs of people. These 
goods are sold to consumers and a profit is earned by the traders.

Services are actions. A service is work that someone provides 
for  someone  else.  Fields  like  education,  transportation,  health  and 
postal  services  come  under  this  category.  Some  services  are  given 
free while some have to be paid for.

Activity 6 Reading 

Given below is an article read by Nisala, who is a prefect. He read the 
article to get an idea about the utensils the delegates would use when 
eating.  Read it aloud and answer the questions.

The tools used for eating food vary 
around the world. They include spoons, 
chopsticks,  forks,  etc.    These  utensils 
mostly  depend  on  the  kind  of  food 
people eat.  Spoons, forks and knives are 
commonly  found  in  western  countries 
such  as  England,  Germany  and  France.  
However, they vary in shape and size depending on the purpose. For 
example, table fork, fruit fork and dessert fork vary in size.

Chopsticks have been used in East Asia for many years. They 
are used in countries such as China, Japan and Korea.  However, it is 
said that the Chinese were the first to use 

them

.

Apart  from  that,  people  in  some 
countries use fingers to eat. For instance, 
in Sri Lanka people use fingers to mix the 
curries with their rice. In Ethiopia people 
use  their  right  hand  to  eat  food.    Their 
’,  a  pancake-like  flat 
staple  food  is  ‘
bread which is usually served on a large 

injera

This

injera
flat plate. 
 is topped with all types 
’ 
of  curries.    They  use  pieces  of  ‘
to scoop the curries.  Similarly, Indians 
naan
too  have  the  habit  of  scooping  the 
’ 
vegetables and other curries with ‘
’.  Many people in Mexico too 
or ‘
’  to  scoop  rice,  beans  and
use  ‘

chapathi
tortillas

other  food.    However,  at  present  people  all  over  the  world,  across 
different cultures use forks, knives and spoons even to eat their own 
local dishes.

the city boys see it and laugh at me?

“There, listen! Mudalihamy, your number is being called. Hurry 

up, my boy!”

How should I go to the starting point? Should I walk or should 
I run? Some of the boys are wearing shoes with spikes. Will they step 
on my feet? Will I be able to compete with them and win? One thing 
is certain. If I win, father, mother and everyone in my family will be 
happy.

“Come on Saroj!”
“Come on Priyan!”
“Come on Janak!”

The playground was large. The sports teacher asked me to wait 

there and disappeared among the crowd. 

I mustn’t go anywhere from here. 

What a crowd of students! Boys in white shoes and white socks. 

How smart they look! They must be from the city. I’ve heard that the 

boys from the city are a bit arrogant.

Who will say, “Come on Mudalihamy!”? I remember my friends 

cheering me at the house meet. It gave me a lot of courage that day.

“Ready, steady, go!”

A boy wearing spikes is running fast just next to me. I must run 
faster than him. Will he step on my foot? Never mind. Let him. I will 
still run faster. Now it’s close to the end.  I think I have won.

“Here is another result. Under thirteen, hundred meters, first 

place, Kalubandage Mudalihamy.”

I  heard  the  loud  speaker  announcing  my  name.  It  was  like  a 
dream  come  true.  Everyone  was  cheering.  Everyone  was  clapping. 
I  couldn’t  hear  what  the  loudspeaker  announced  because  of  the 
cheering.  The  boy  who  was  wearing  the  spiked  shoes  was  on  my 
right. He had won the second place. 

“Congratulations  Mudalihamy!  You  were  great!”  he  said, 

shaking my hand.

The History of Footwear

Historically  shoes  were  worn  primarily  for  protection. 
According to archaelogical evidence, experts believe that shoes were 
invented about 40,000 years ago. However, it was not until sometime 
later that footwear was worn by people frequently. 

It  is  hard  to  imagine  a  time  before  the  invention  of  shoes. 
Yet, what started as a practical venture grew into a varied, booming 
industry.  Though all shoes share basic characteristics, their colouring, 
materials and designs have transformed drastically over thousands 
of years.

The earliest shoes were made 
of  soft  leather.    They  resembled 
either sandals or moccasins. In the 
early  19
  century,  women’s  and 
men’s  shoes  finally  began  to  differ 
from  one  another  in  style,  colour, 
heel, and toe shape. During this era, 
shoes were made straight, meaning that there was no differentiation 
between left and right shoes.

comfort  by  making  foot-specific  shoes.  The  face  of  the  footwear 
changed  drastically  from  decade  to  decade.  This  was  due  to  the 
technological advances that made the shoemaking process simpler.

In  the  early  seventies,  platform  shoes  and  wedges  were  popular 
among  women,  though  they  became  less  so  in  the  eighties  and 
nineties. Men’s shoe trends, however, were mostly static, as the types 
such  as  oxfords  (leather  shoes  that  fasten  with  lace)    and  loafers 
(leather shoes that you can wear without fastening them) remained 
the dominant styles.

History tells us about many great people in the world.  They 
have made a name for themselves in different fields of study.  Leonardo 
da  Vinci  is  one  such  person  worth  mentioning.  Born  on  April  15, 
1452, in Vinci, Italy, Da Vinci is known in the world as an exceptional 
artist,  mathematician,  inventor,  writer,  sculptor,  draftsman,  etc. 
His  knowledge  of  science  and  nature  is  believed  to  have  greatly

influenced his work in different fields.  The world famous paintings 
such as “Monalisa”, “Virgin of the Rocks” and “The Last Supper” are 
among his great works.

Da  Vinci  as  a  child  received  little 
formal  education  with  nothing  beyond 
basic  reading,  writing 
  and  mathematics   
instruction. However, his artistic talents were 
evident from an early age. At the age of 14 he 
learned technical  skills  including  metalwork, 
leather arts, carpentry, drawing, painting and 
sculpture. He learned all these under the noted 
artist  Andrea  del  Verrocchio  in  Florence.    A 
pen-and-ink  drawing  of  a  landscape  of  the 
Arno valley is known as one of his early - dated 
work which is believed to have been sketched 
in 1473.

Martial Arts

Martial art is a form of combat: a traditional form of art found 
among  different  nations  in  different  styles.  This  is  practised  for 
self-defence,  mental  and  spiritual  development  and  sometimes  for 
law  enforcement.    There  are  two  types  of  martial  arts:  armed  and 
unarmed.  In  armed  martial  arts  weapons  like  swords,  shields  and 
daggers are used. However, kicking and punching are commonly used 
techniques in both armed and unarmed combat. 

Styles  and  techniques  used  in  martial  arts  differ  depending 
on  the  application  and  intention.  For  example,  today  many  young 
women learn martial arts for self-defence while some turn to it for 
mental and spiritual development as well as for physical fitness. Judo, 
boxing, karate, kickboxing, taekwondo and wrestling are some forms 
of different types of martial arts.

Angampora or Angam is known as the indigenous fighting art 
in Sri Lanka.  It is believed to have a history which dates back to more 
than 33000 years.  This art is said to have originated from a Yakka 
warrior.  Ancient  kings  had used this form of fighting  art  to protect 
the nation.  Angam can be divided into three sections: Angampora, 
Illangampora and Mayangam. It has been the traditional practice of 
the Guru to impart Angam knowledge and its secrets only to his most 
faithful and trustworthy students. Hence, the value and popularity of 
this form of martial arts has increased over the generations.

A  student  who  takes  the  Angam  oath  will  enter  the  training 
area without headwear or footwear.  It is considered as a sacred space 
made of fine clay and ground coconut fibres.  However, the students 
are  trained  in  different  locations  such  as  grasslands,  beaches  and 
even swamplands. It is a must for a student to engage in breathing 
meditation to make his or her combat skills perfect.

1.  What are the most essential necessities of man?
2.  Why do people need shelter?
Activity 9  Reading   
3.  What are the forms of shelter used by the early man?

Read and answer the questions.

Food,  clothing  and  shelter  are  the  three  most  essential 
necessities of man. Since the beginning of human civilisation, human 
beings have used different types of shelter to shield themselves from 
the weather, to protect themselves against wild animals and insects, 
and as a place to rest.  In the prehistoric era, man made use of what 
was found in the natural environment for shelter.  Trees, for example, 
provided him with protection against the heat of the sun, the cold in 
the winter and the rain. Trees also protected man against animals that 
could not climb up trees. Later, man shifted to caves for shelter, which 
provided  greater  protection  against  extreme  weather  conditions.  
However, they offered less protection against wild animals.

, man learnt to build a shelter of his own to protect 
himself.  It is believed that man initially made use of bones, stones 
, man learnt to use 
and even parts of trees to build his shelter.  
Then
materials like earth which was dried in the sun to form clay blocks.

Home on the Range

Oh give me a home where the buffalo roam, 
where the deer and the antelope play,
where seldom is heard a discouraging word,
and the skies are not cloudy all day.

Chorus:   Home, home on the range,

where the deer and the antelope play,
where seldom is heard a discouraging word,
and the skies are not cloudy all day.

Where the air is so pure, and the zephyrs* so free, 
the breezes so balmy and light,
that I would not exchange my home on the range,
for all of the cities so bright.

The Red man was pressed from this part of the west,

to the banks of the Red River where seldom if ever
their flickering campfires burn.

with the light from the glittering stars,
have I stood there amazed and asked as I gazed,

(4)

if their glory exceeds that of ours.

Oh, I love these wild flowers in this dear land of ours, 
the curlew I love to hear cry,
and I love the white rocks and the antelope flocks,
that graze on the mountain slopes high.

(5)

Oh give me a land where the bright diamond sand, 
flows leisurely down in the stream;
where the graceful white swan goes gliding along,
like a maid in a heavenly dream.

(6)

then I would not exchange my home on the range, 
where the deer and the antelope play;
where seldom is heard a discouraging word,

Relative Pronouns

The  highlighted  words  in  the  conversation  are  called  relative 
pronouns.

In addition, we use 

 with nouns that refer to a place and 

 with nouns that refer to a time.

85



A  relative  clause,  i.e.  a  clause  that  begins  with  a  relative 
pronoun, gives us information about the noun that comes before 
e.g. :- There’s going to be an exhibition to mark the Environment 
it.

Day, which falls next month.



The  underlined  relative  clause  tells  us  something  about  the 


Environment Day.

and non-defining relative clauses.

There are two types of relative clauses: defining relative clauses 

We use a defining relative clause to indicate which particular 
e.g.  :-  The  boy  who  came  first  in  the  essay  competition  is  in  my 
person or thing we are talking about.

brother’s class.



who came first in the essay competition

The relative clause 

identifies the noun coming before it. In other words without the 
relative  clause  it  would  be  unclear  which  boy  is  being  talked 

about. 

We use a non-defining relative clause to give additional, non-
e.g. :- Our class teacher, who always comes to school early, is very 
essential information about a person or thing.

kind and hardworking.



who always comes to school early

The relative clause 

 merely 
gives  some  additional  information  about  our  class  teacher.  In 
other words, it is not essential for the sentence to be meaningful.
It is important to remember that we should use a comma before 
e.g. :- I borrowed this novel from Suresh, who lives down our lane.
a non-defining relative clause.


If the non-defining relative clause comes in the middle of the 

e.g. :- Suresh, who reads a lot, loves learning new words.
sentence we should use a comma both before it and after it. 


that’

We  do  not  use  the  relative  pronoun  ‘

  with  non-defining 

relative clauses.

Upcycling - ‘Turning Trash into Treasure’

Can you remember the last time you dropped an empty yoghurt 
pot in a litter bin or threw away that cardboard box that your pair of 
shoes came in? When you were disposing of them, did you pause for 
a  second  to  think  that  you  might  have  found  some  creative  use  for 
them? For example, you could well have made a lovely vase with the 
empty yoghurt pot. That is what is known as upcycling: the process of 
turning old or disposable materials into something useful and often 
beautiful.

  Upcycling  can  be  beneficial  in  many  ways.  To  begin  with,  it 
gives us the opportunity to tap into our capacity for creative thinking, 
which, in turn, could help us to cultivate new and useful hobbies. It 
can also be seen as a good way of saving money and of being thrifty 
as we think of new uses for things which we would otherwise simply 
throw  away.  This,  in  turn,  helps  keep  the  environment  clean  and 
beautiful. Furthermore, upcycling may provide people with 
opportunities for self-employment.

Read the passage and answer the questions.
1)   What is upcycling?
2)   What may be converted into a vase?
3)   Name two advantages of upcycling.
4)   Find two relative pronouns used in the passage.

The Greatest 
Wealth

Activity 1 - Act out  

Once  there  was  a  kind  and  generous  king.  He  looked  after  his 
people well.  His people, in return, loved him and worked hard to 
build the country. Their country was very prosperous.

Long live the 
king!

Our king 
is very 
just and 
honest. I 
like him a 
lot.

Of course 
we are.

We‘re lucky 
to have such 
a great king.

So do I.

91

Unfortunately, as time passed, the king became lazy. He ate a lot 
of unhealthy food and wasted his time on trivial things. He hated 
doing routine exercises usually  expected of kings. Soon, he became 
overweight and fell sick often. The king, who had once been active 
and energetic, was now lethargic and unhappy.

Oh! It’s so 
hard to walk. 
I feel really 
tired.

I’m worried 
about His 
Majesty’s 
health.

It looks like 
our king has 
become a real 
lazy bones.

So am I.

Doesn’t he 
listen to 
anybody?

No, he 
doesn’t.

That’s good 
news. Ask 
him to come 
to the palace.

Can you please 
come to the 
palace to see our 
king, who’s not 
well?

I’m sorry  I can’t.   If the 
king comes to me, I will 
cure him.

 But you have to 
make sure that he walks all 
the way here. Otherwise my 
treatments won’t work.

One day.....

Your Majesty, a 
wise man has come 
to our country. He 
claims he can cure 
any sickness.

92

 
Next day, the king visited the wise man. It was a long walk to the 
wise man’s house.

Yes, I can.

 But I need to 

Can you cure 
me?

find a rare herb to prepare 
the cure for you. Could you 
please come tomorrow?

Do you want 
me to walk 
all this way 
again?

Yes. Don’t worry. My 
medicine will soon make 
you better. Er, one other 
thing, Your Majesty. You 
have to eat more fruit and 
vegetables and cut down 
on sugar. It will speed up 
your recovery.

For thirty days, the wise man made the king walk from the palace 
to  his hut saying on each day that he had not yet found the herb 
for the cure. Gradually, with all the exercise, the king began to lose 
weight and  feel better. On the thirty first day ……

Yes, indeed. The 
greatest wealth 
is health.  Thank 
you for making 
me realize it.

Are you 
feeling any 
better now, 
Your Majesty?

Yes, I am.

  I’ve 

lost a lot of 
weight and I can 
move easily now.

Your Majesty, your 
unhealthy lifestyle 
made you ill and 
unhappy. All your 
riches will be 
useless if you are not 
healthy..

Conditional Sentences Type 1

Type 1 conditional sentences are used to refer to:

•  actions that are likely to happen (realistic situations)

The result will happen only if the condition is fulfilled.
Form:
If clause (condition)                        Main clause (result)
If + simple present  tense,                simple future tense
If I go to the pharmacy,                  I will buy a roll of bandage.

If the if - clause comes first, you should use a comma to separate 
the two clauses.
The main clause can come before the if clause.
When this happens, we do not use a comma to separate the two 
• 
clauses.

I will buy a roll of bandage if I go to the pharmacy.

Activity 5   Grammar    

Refer to the table and build conditional sentences. Make the necessary 
punctuation and capitalization changes.

Physical Fitness and the Value of Exercise

Physical fitness refers to being healthy  in body. Being physically 
fit gives us the ability to engage in daily activities and sports without 
being  unduly  tired.    Together  with  nutrition,  rest  and  relaxation, 
physical exercises also play a major role in determining the level of a 
person’s physical fitness.

There are many ways that exercises help us to be healthy. When 
we exercise, we burn calories and when we burn calories regularly, 
we  do  not  become  overweight.  Thus,  exercising  is  very  useful  in 
maintaining a healthy weight. It also helps to improve heart and lung 
health  besides  increasing  our  energy  levels.  Another  advantage  is 
that regular physical exercises also contribute to preventing illnesses.
Exercising brings down unhealthy cholesterol levels and minimises 
the  risk  of  heart  disease.  Apart  from  that,  when  you  are  physically 
active,  you  sleep  better  at  night.  A  good  night’s  sleep  relaxes  and 
rejuvenates your body. As a result, you feel refreshed and stress-free.

In modern society, addiction to television, smart phones and 
computers tends to keep people away from physical activities.  This 
is very  harmful to our health. Contrary to what some  may believe, 
exercising  does  not  have  to  be  tedious  or  monotonous.  It  does  not 
have to be merely stretching, running or lifting weights .  It can be an 
enjoyable activity such as hiking, swimming, cycling or dancing. You 
can turn it into a social event which you can enjoy with your friends. 
This  way  it  will  boost  not  only  your  physical  well-being  but  your 
mental well-being too.

Immunization 

We 
touch many 
surfaces with our 
hands. Therefore it is 
important to wash our 
hands before  and after 
eating and after using 
the toilet.

diseases

getting dangerous 

like polio, diphtheria and 
tuberculosis.  Getting yourself 
vaccinated  at the right time 
is a must to prevent such 
diseases.

Diseases 
can spread through 
personal items like towels, 
combs, dining plates and drinking 
glasses. Therefore, they should 
not be shared with anybody.

But he did not give up…

At around 5:30 in the evening on December 10, 1914, a huge 
explosion  broke  out  in  West  Orange,  New  Jersey.  It  happened  in 
the famous inventor Thomas Edison’s plant. In no time most of the 
buildings were in flames. Although many fire departments rushed to 
the scene, the fire was too powerful to be put out quickly.

Edison’s 24-year-old son Charles painfully watched the fire destroy 
his father’s work. Edison calmly walked over to him. In a soft voice he 
told his son, “Go and call your mother and all her friends. They’ll never 
see a fire like this again.” When Charles objected, Edison said, “It’s all 
right. We’ve just got rid of a lot of rubbish.” Edison could have wept, 
yelled in anger, or locked himself in his house in a state of depression. 
But instead, he put on a smile and told his son to call his mother to 
enjoy the spectacle.

Later, at the scene of the blaze, Edison told one of the reporters, 
“Although I am over 67 years old, I’ll start all over again tomorrow.” 
He  stuck  to  his  word  and  immediately  began  the  crucial  task  of 
rebuilding his plant. 

111

 
 
The  flames  had  destroyed  years  of  priceless  records  and 
prototypes.  But  after  just  three  weeks,  with  a  loan  from  his  friend 
Henry Ford, Edison got a part of the plant up and running again. His 
employees  worked  double  shifts  and  set  to  work  producing  more 
than ever. Edison became a legend in history because he did not give 
up easily.

A Day without the Sun

Have  you  ever  wondered  how  important  the  Sun  is  to  us  here  on 
Earth? What would happen if the Sun suddenly disappeared?

The  Sun  is  a  star  and  it  is  the  centre  of  our  solar  system.

The  Sun’s  immense  mass  draws  all 
the  other  planets  in  the  solar  system 
towards  it.  Since  the  Earth  and  all  the 
other  planets  are  moving  very  fast 
through space, the Sun’s presence keeps 
them moving around it. If the Sun were 
to  suddenly  disappear,  the  Earth  and 
the  other  planets  would  continue  their

space in a straight line.

So what would happen to us if the Sun suddenly went out? As 
light from the Sun takes eight and a half minutes to reach the Earth, 
we wouldn’t notice it immediately but nine minutes later, we’d find 
ourselves in complete darkness.

As the Sun was illuminating the Moon, it too would disappear! 
The  same  would  happen  to  many  other  celestial  bodies  in  the  sky, 
such  as  planets,  which  we  see  only  because  of  the  Sun’s  reflected 
light. They too would disappear in a similar

Here is a story of two groups of people who had the courage and 
determination to overcome adversity through innovation.

They brought the sun down!

The villages of Rjukan, Norway, and Viganella, Italy, are both 
situated in deep valleys. The mountains around these valleys block 
the  sun’s  rays  from  reaching  the  two  villages  for  up  to  six  months 
every year. Therefore, neither Rjukan nor Viganella enjoys the luxury 
of sunlight like we do. Can you imagine the lives of people in these 
villages without sunlight for almost six months?

This is how they have brightened their day.
To illuminate those darker winter months, the two villages have built 
huge  mirrors  that  track  the  sun  and  reflect  daylight  downwards. 
Viganella  completed  its  huge  computer-controlled  mirror  in  2006. 
Rjukan also followed the same method , mounting a mirror that will 
reflect a 600 square metre (6,500 square foot) beam of sunshine into 
the town square below.

Be Yourself

The world would like to change you;
there are pressures all around.
You must decide just who you are,
then firmly hold your ground.

You have an image of yourself,
an ideal sense of you;
and to this vision you must always
struggle to be true.

You know what you are good at,
and you know where talents lie;
but if you’re ruled by others,
your uniqueness could pass by.

Remember there is much to learn;
but all new things aren’t good.
Wisdom lies in what you’ve learned
and what you have withstood.

So, be yourself and don’t allow
the world to take control.
Preserving your identity
is life’s most precious goal.

Activity 4 

Read the following text and answer the questions.

Animal  world  is  diverse.    Their  life-style  determines  the  
habitat and vise versa.  Some build their own houses while others use 
houses that do not belong to them.  There are also ones who are born 
with their own house.  Incredible, isn’t it?

Camel,  the  ship  of  the  desert,  has  a  hump  to  store  food  and 
water  as  its  habitat  usually  is  dry  land.  Similarly,  penguins  which 
are  aquatic,  flightless  birds  use  the  shape  of  their  body  to  dive 
into  the  water  to  find  food  and  be  safe  from  any  predators.  When 
we  talk  about  the  habitat,  have  you  heard  about  creatures  whose 
appearance changes according to where they are. It is said that they 
have mastered the art of camouflage and mimicry which they use to 
hide from predators.

Some  work  from  dawn  to  dusk  to  build  their  houses  while 
others may just intrude.  As we have heard, the cuckoo is one such 
parasitic  bird  which  lays  its  eggs  in  the  crows’  nest  to  get  their 
nestlings fed by crow parents.  It is believed that some snakes too are 
parasitic.  They  live in hills which are built by termites. 

At the same time it is impressive to see groups of animals get 
together to build incredible structures. Bee-hives,  ant colonies are 
such fine examples.  Have you seen the large number of bird nests 
built by entire flocks on one big tree?  

Some creatures are blessed with their own shelter. The tortoise, 
the snail and the conch are a few such examples.  Whenever they are 
threatened they swiftly hide inside their shell.

Animal  world  is  amazing.    But  we  can  see  these  wonders  of 

nature, only if we are good observers.

Being innovative, changing with right knowledge 
Be a light to the country as well as to the world. 

Message from the Hon. Minister of Education 

The past two decades have been significant in the world history due to changes that took 
place  in  technology.  The  present  students  face  a  lot  of  new  challenges  along  with  the  rapid 
development of Information Technology, communication and other related fields. The manner 
of  career  opportunities  are  liable  to  change  specifically  in  the  near  future.  In  such  an 
environment,  with  a  new  technological  and  intellectual  society,  thousands  of  innovative  career 
opportunities would be created. To win those challenges, it is the responsibility of  the Sri Lankan 
Government and myself, as the Minister of Education, to empower you all.  

This book is a product of free education. Your aim must be to use this book properly and 
acquire  the  necessary  knowledge  out  of  it.  The  government  in  turn  is  able  to  provide  free 
textbooks to you, as a result of the commitment and labour of your parents and elders. 

Since we have understood that the education is crucial in deciding the future of a country, 
the  government  has  taken  steps  to  change  curriculum  to  suit  the  rapid  changes  of  the 
technological  world.  Hence,  you  have  to  dedicate  yourselves  to  become  productive  citizens.  I 
believe that the knowledge this book provides will suffice your aim.  

It  is  your  duty  to  give  a  proper  value  to  the  money  spent  by  the  government  on  your 
education.  Also  you  should  understand  that  education  determines  your  future.  Make  sure  that 
you reach the optimum social stratum through education. 

I  congratulate  you  to  enjoy  the  benefits  of  free  education  and  bloom  as  an  honoured 

citizen who takes the name of Sri Lanka to the world.   

 Akila Viraj Kariyawasam

Foreword 

The educational objectives of the contemporary world are becoming more complex along with 
the  economic,  social,  cultural  and  technological  development.  The  learning  and  teaching 

process too is changing in relation to human experiences, technological differences, research 
and new indices. Therefore, it is required to produce the textbook by including subject related 

information according to the objectives in the syllabus in order to maintain the teaching process 

by organizing learning experiences that suit to the learner needs. The textbook is not merely a 

learning tool for the learner. It is a blessing that contributes to obtain a higher education along 

with a development of conduct and attitudes, to develop values and to obtain learning experi-

ences.

The  government  in  its  realization  of  the  concept  of  free  education  has  offered  you  all  the 

textbooks from grades 1-11. I would like to remind you that you should make the maximum use 

of these textbooks and protect them well. I sincerely hope that this textbook would assist you 

to obtain the expertise to become a virtuous citizen with a complete personality who would be 

a valuable asset to the country.

I would like to bestow my sincere thanks on the members of the editorial and writer boards as 

well as on the staff of the Educational Publications Department who have strived to offer this 

textbook to you.

The Asian Region

The aim of this chapter is to learn the important information on 
the Asian Region.

Geographical location of Asia

Relative Location

The  continent  of  Asia  is 

located  in  the  Eastern  part  of  the 

Northern Hemisphere of the Earth. 

Geographically, it is connected to 
the  continent  of  Europe.  Some 

of  the  islands  that  belong  to  the 

Asian continent are located in the 

Southern hemisphere. (Fig.1.1)

The  Asian  continent  is  bounded 
by,

 ² The Arctic ocean on the North

 ² The Pacific ocean on the East

 ² The Indian ocean on the South  
  and,

Fig 1.1 - Geographical location of Asia

 ² The continent of Europe on the West.

In a geographical view, the Continent of Europe and Asia are both located 

as one landmass called Eurasia. Ural Mountain Range, River Ural, Caspian Sea, 

Caucasus Mountains, Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea, Suez Canal and Red Sea are 

the boundaries that separate Asia from Europe and Africa.

There are many islands that belong to the Asian continent. Japanese islands, 

Indonesian  islands,  Philippine  islands,  Sri  Lanka  and Taiwan  are  examples  for 

those islands which are larger in extent. Andaman Islands, Nicobar Islands and 

the Maldives are examples of smaller islands.

Absolute Location

The	location	of	any	place	or	region	on	the	Earth	can	definitely	be	shown	
using  geographical  coordinates. Accordingly,  the  absolute  location  of  the Asian 
region can be shown on the basis of longitudes and latitudes as follows;

The Asian continent is located between 100 Latitude South
to 800 Latitude North and between 250 and 1800 Longitudes
East.

Uniqueness of the Asian region

There	 are	 many	 specific	 physical	 and	 human	 characteristics	 in	 the	Asian	

region. 

 ² The largest continent in the world

 ² Presence of all the climatic types of the world

Several unique 

physical and human 

characteristics 

 ² Presence	of	different	human	races,	ethnic	groups	and	languages	and	

cultural diversity

 ² Birth place of many major religions

 ² Location of the largest mountain ranges and the highest mountain 

peak

 ² The most popular continent

The Asian continent covers an area of 44.6 million km2 (44,579,000 km2). 
It is about 30% of the land area of the earth and 8.7 % of the entire surface of the 
Earth. 

         Source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia 2017.02.05

The largest mountain range in the world, the Himalayas, is located in the 
continent of Asia. Mount Everest, the highest peak which is 8848 meters in height 
is  located  here.  The  Dead  Sea  is  also  located  in  the Asian  land  mass,  is  below 
the sea level. Cherrapunji in the state of Meghalaya in India receives the highest 
rainfall and Gobi desert is considered as the area that receives the lowest rainfall in 
the world. Both areas are located in the continent of Asia.

All types of climates that exist in the world can be found here. Therefore, 
every type of forest in the world also can be found in the continent of Asia. Therefore, 
biodiversity which means the diversity of plants and animals is greater in this region.

According  to  the  size  of  population,  more  than  half  or  about  60%  of  the 
world population lives in the Asian region. It is notable that China and India, the 
two most populous countries in the world are located in Asia. Indonesia, Pakistan, 
Bangladesh and Japan that belong to the top ten countries with the highest population 
of the world are also located in the Asian region. Accordingly, six out of 10 most 
populous countries are located in the continent of Asia.

The  average  density  of  population  of  the  continent  of  Asia  is  87  per 
kilometer,  but  there  are  some  regions  in Asia  with  a  high  population  density  of 
more than 3000 people per kilometer. In the Asian region, there are 54 States or 
independent countries. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia 2017.02.05)

The  diversity  in  the  culture,  ethnicity  and  race  is  a  special  feature  of  the 
population	of	the	Asian	region.	Existence	of	various	languages	is	another	specific	
characteristic as various ethnic groups are living there. According to ethnologue, 
that  providing  information  on  languages  in  the  world,  297  living  languages  are 
available only in China. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia 2017.02.05) 

Asian region has become unique as it is the home to the world’s most ancient 
civilizations such as Mesapothemia, Howang-Ho, and Indus. It is the birth place 
of  major  religions  like  Buddhism,  Hinduism,  Islam  and  Christianity. At  present, 
people who follow religions like Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam and Christianity live 
in this continent.

Activities

Physical landscape in Asia

Relief

The	 most	

specific	

topographic feature in the Asian 

region  is  the  Mountain  Range 

of  Himalaya.  This  mountain 

range  spreads  2500  kilometers 

and  stretches  in  a  land  area  of 

6.12,000 square kilometers. Due 

to  this  large  mountain  range, 

India is seen to be separated from 

Fig 1.2  -  Mount Everest - The highest peak in 

Himalaya mountain range

Asia and as a result, India is called a sub continent. There are many peaks including 

Everest located on this mountain range, exceeding 7000 meters in altitude.

The  other  large  mountain  ranges  located  in  Asia  are  Altai,  Kunlun, 

Karakorum, Tangshan, Ghats, Sargros and Urals.

Several large plateaus in the world are also located in Asia. Some of them 
are Tibet, Pamir, Deccan, Central Siberian and Iran plateaus. Tibet plateau is the 
one that located at the highest elevation in the world. It is located at 5000 meters 
of altitude and surrounded by the mountain ranges like Himalayas, Karakoram and 
Pamir. As it is the highest plateau in the world and spread over a very large land 
area, it is called 'Rooftop of the world'.

North  Asia  is  a  large  plain.  It  is  known  as  the  Western  Siberian  Plain. 

Manchurian plain and the Great Chinese plain are the other large plains located in 

Asia. Apart from that, large plains are located close to the river valleys of Indus, 

Ganges and Hwang Ho.

Drainage

The large number of river systems scattered all over the Asian region is 

the	major	characteristic	of	the	drainage.	These	rivers	flow	into	different	oceans	
and seas.

Climate

The  Earth  is  divided  into  three  main  climatic  zones  according  to  the 
variations of the distribution of temperature towards the South Pole and towards 
the North Pole from the equator.

 ² Tropical zone (Warm climate)
 ² Temperate zone (Mild climate)
 ² Frigid zone (Cold climate) (Refer to the Map 1.3)

The  Asian  continent  spreads  over  to  the  North  Pole  from  the  equator. 
Therefore, all types of climate that belong to those three climatic zones are found 
there.

 ² Tropical zone (Warm climate)

Very  high  temperature  prevails  throughout  the  whole  year.  The  average 
temperature is more than 180C. Therefore, a warm climatic condition prevails here.

 ² Temperate zone (Mild climate)

The  average  temperature  in  this  zone  is  lower  than  the  tropical  zone. 
Seasonal variations exist here due to the increase and decrease of temperature from 
time to time throughout the whole year. A clear warm season and cold season is 
seen here.

 ² Frigid zone (Cold climate)

The  main  feature  that  can  be  seen  here  is  the  falling  snow  and  land  being 
covered with snow for a longer period of the year due to the lower level of temperature.

In	these	three	climatic	zones,	several	types	of	sub	climates	with	different	
features	are	be	seen	due	to	the	influence	of	various	factors,	such	as	changes	of	the	
rainfall,	influence	of	monsoons	and	oceans,	altitude,	location	of	mountain	ranges
and continents.

These types of climates and the areas they are distributed are included in the table

²  The  lowest  temperature  in  Asia  is  recorded  from  the  small  city  of 
Verkhoyansk located in Russia and its temperature decreases up to -500C 
during certain days.

²  The highest temperature in Asia is recorded from Jacobabad in Pakistan and  

it is about 550C.

Natural vegetation and wild life

Natural	 vegetation	 changes	 regionally	 according	 to	 the	 differences	 of	
rainfall and temperature. Accordingly, the natural vegetation and the wild life have 
adapted to the climatic type. 

Tropical zone –Tropical Rain Forests 

Tropical evergreen forests can be seen in the areas where high temperature 
and  heavy  rainfall  is  experienced  throughout  the  whole  year.  In  these  forests, 
there are various tall trees like Mahogany, Ebony, Rosewood, Kaluwara, Bamboo, 
Sandalwood,	Akeshia	are	available.	The	forests	consist	of	different	layers.	Various	
types of creepers, moss, lichen as well as epiphytes grow abundantly here. There is 

also great bio-diversity. 

Species	of	monkeys,	reptiles,	snakes,	fish	species	and	chameleon	species	
are abundantly seen here. Animal species such as tiger, leopard, pig, jackal, deer, 
and sambar live in large numbers in these areas.

Temperate zone - Temperate Deciduous Forests

Deciduous  Forests  are  grown  in  the  temperate  zone  as  a  result  of  the 

existence of cold and warm seasons during the year. A special characteristic in these 

forests  is  falling  of  leaves  from  trees  annually.  Oak,  Mulberry,  Chestnut,  Pine, 

Eucalyptus,	Douglas	fir	are	specific	trees	grown	in	these	forests.	Kinds	of	animals	

living here are Wolf, Bear, Sambar deer, and Antelope. 

Fig 1.6 - Temperate zone forests and animal species

Frigid zone - Coniferous forests

The	specific	characteristic	of	this	climatic	zone	with	Taiga	and	Tundra	climate	
is the prevalence of a longer cold season. Coniferous forests are situated in this region. 
The trees are in a shape of a cone so as to resist snowfall. Leaves are in a shape of 
needles.	The	species	of	trees	grown	here	are	pine,	spruce,	fir,	oak	and	larch.

Reindeer,  Polar  bear,  Snow  fox,  Snow  dog,  Sable,  and  Mink  are  animal

Population distribution

The  present  population  in  Asia  is  4.46  billion  (4460  million)  (world 
populationview.com/continents/asia-population  2017.02.01)  Out  of  this,  more 
than half is distributed in China and India.

This  population  is  unevenly  distributed  among  countries  and  it  varies 
from region to region. Physical factors have impacted this unequal distribution of 
population. Relief features, climate, drainage and soil are such physical factors.

When considering the population in Asia, a higher population density can 
be found close to the river valleys in South, Southeast and East Asian countries. 
(Over 500 per km2)

 ² Indo-Gangatic plain in North India.

 ² Irrawaddy river valley in Myanmar.

 ² Hwang Ho river valley in China are given as examples.

Landscape of  

Sri Lanka

  Relief, drainage, climate and natural vegetation are the 
main components of the physical landscape. The human 
landscape is created by man through his activities on the 
basis of this physical background. The main objective of 
this chapter is to study the inter-relation between physical 
and human landscapes of Sri Lanka.

Physical Landscape

Sri Lanka is an island with a beautiful landscape located in the Indian Ocean. 
The  island  consists  of  mountains,  plains,  rivers,  waterfalls,  beaches  and  various 
types of vegetation as well as buildings, roads, tanks, industries and croplands built 
by man on this physical environment.  

Relief

The land of Sri Lanka consists of complex physical features as a result of 
geo-activities that occurred during a long period in the geo history. Among them, a 
salient feature is the central mountains located in the center of the country and the 
plain that extends towards the coastal belt from there. The island can be divided 
into three zones on the basis of relief. Identify it by studying Map 2.1

Coastal Plain

The region from sea level up to the 30m contour line along the coast belongs 
to the coastal plain. In the South in certain places, the coastal plain is about 3 km 
narrow and in the North it is about 32 km wide. The coastal plain consists of various 
relief features. The lower areas of river valleys and the river mouth regions belong to 
this. The coastal plain has several special features such as flat land, points, lagoons, 
sand dunes as well as the features like braided rivers, marshy lands and deltas.

Fig 2.1 - Coastal plain 

Marshes  -  Marshes  are  formed  when  the  sediments  brought  by  rivers  are 
deposited as sand banks and blocking the estuaries or water remaining in lowlands 
due to overflowing of rivers. Examples of marshes are Muthurajawela, Bundala, 
Kalametiya, Somawathiya, Anawilundawa and Kirala kele. 

Bays - A bay has a wider opening of the sea protruding towards the land filled with 
saline water. Many such bays are located along side the coastal line in Sri Lanka. 
Some of them are Koddiyar Bay, Arugam Bay and Weligama Bay.

For free distribution

25

Lagoons  -  A  lagoon  is  a  lengthy 
stretch of an area filled with brackish 
water, separated from the sea by sand 
bars which have narrow outlets to the 
sea  only  during  a  certain  period  of 
the  year.  Negombo,  Jaffna,  Puttlam, 
Chillaw and Batticaloa are examples.

Points or Headlands -  A land area 
with hard stone that protrudes towards 
sea  is  called  a  point.  Dondra  head, 
Fowl  Point,  Sangamankanda  Point 
and Point Pedro are examples.

Islands - Small land areas completely 
covered with water are called islands. 

Sea Cliffs - A sea cliff is a land area 
composed of hard rocks standing at an 
edge  of  the  coast  with  a  steep  slope. 
Trincomallee, Kirinda and Rumassala 
are examples.

Fig 2.2 - Blow hole at Kudawella

Delta - Delta is a land area formed with the deposit of sediments carried by a river 
close to river mouths with a shape of a triangle. Deltas can be seen close to the river 
mouths of Mahaweli Ganga, Mee oya and Kala oya.

There are  attractive places located  close  to the  coastal  line.  Blow  hole  is 
such a feature. This name has been given as a result of splashing water up through 
a cave making a sound.

Intermediate plain

The intermediate plain is 30-300 m in altitude. According to the Map 2.1, the 
plain is wider in the North and becomes narrower towards the South. The features 
that can be mostly seen are contour hedges, residual hills, rivers, flood plains and 
plains.

Parallel 
mountains

Rakwana Mountains and Bulutota hills that extend 
North - West to South - East directions

Residual hills

Residual hills are the remains of hard mountains 
which had been subjected to erosion. Kataragama, 
Mihintale, Sigiriya, Ritigala and Govindahela are 
examples.

There are many rivers flowing across the intermediate plain. Specific features 

located in between them are plains, flood plains and undulated lands.

Central Hills

The areas over 300 m belong to this zone. This is indicated in No. 3 of Map 

2.2. This region is more complex than the other two relief zones.

1. Samanala Mountain Range

2. Namunukula Mountain Range

3. Pidurutalagal Kirigalpotta Mountain Range

4. Knuckles Mountain Range (Map 2.2)

Plateaus - A plateau is an area of flat land at a high elevation. There are five Plateaus 
in the Central Hills. (Map 2.2)

 ² Kandy Plateau

 ² Hatton Plateau

 ² Welimada Plateau

 ² Mahawelatenna Plateau

 ² Koslanda Plateau

Gaps or Passes -  A pass is a low area located between two mountains. Haputale, 
Balana, Galagedara and Ginigathhena are examples.

Waterfalls  - The  plateaus  which  are  located  in  the  central  hills  are  of  different 
heights  and  rivers  flow  across  steep  slopes  or  escarpments  forming  waterfalls. 
Bambarakanda, Dunhinda, Luxapana, Diyaluma and Ramboda are examples.

Drainage

Sri Lanka which is rich in water resources contains main 103 river valleys. 
Out of them, 34 rivers starting from hill country, flow in different directions in 
an  aerial  pattern.  These  rivers  are  known  as  permanent  rivers  since  they  are 
abundant  with  water  through  out  the  year.  Some  rivers  that  are  starting  from 
undulated lands in dry zone, flow during rainy season and become dry during dry 
season. These are known as seasonal rivers.

Details of a few major rivers in Sri Lanka are stated in Map 2.3 and Table 2.1

80% of the rivers  located in Sri Lanka flow across the dry zone. Mahaweli 
is the longest river as well and has the largest river basin. Out of the total land area 
in Sri Lanka 1/6 belongs to this.

When we consider the total drainage pattern, Sri Lanka has a radial pattern. 
However, various drainage patterns are formed when tributaries are added to main 
rivers. Among them, Dendritic and Trellis drainage patterns are important. When 
we compare River Mahaweli with kalu Ganga, Kelani Ganga and Gin Ganga, they 
flow through a shorter area and the catchment area is also smaller. During the rainy 
seasons floods occur in abundance close to these rivers.

Climate 

Climate of a particular place 
is the general condition of the 
atmosphere which is determined 
by analysing and concluding on 
weather for a long time.

Weather is the state of 
atmosphere that prevails 
within a short period of time 
at any place.

Sri Lanka is an island located close to the equator. Specific characteristic 
of  the  climate  in  Sri  Lanka  is  the  high  temperature  and  the  rainfall  distributed 
throughout the year.

Temperature

Average  annual  temperature  in  Sri  Lanka  is  270C.  Yet  there  are  small 

regional variations. Map 2.4 clearly shows this.

Map  2.4 - Distribution of Annual Temperature of Sri Lanka

32

For free distribution

Several factors influence the variation of temperature in Sri Lanka.

 ² Proximity to the Indian subcontinent

 ² Altitude (height of land)

 ² Distance from the sea

 ² Changing wind pattern

According  to  the  Map  2.4,  the  Northern  part  of  Sri  Lanka  has  a  high 

temperature while Eastern, Southern and South-Western low lands experience low 
temperature. The reason for high temperature in the Northern part of Sri Lanka 

is its proximity to the Indian sub continent. Areas like Jaffna, Anuradhapura and 

Mannar are subjected to high temperature when temperature increases in India.

When you go to Kandy, Nuwaraeliya or Sri pada you would feel that the 

temperature  is  very  low  in  these  areas.  The  reason  for  this  is  the  decrease  of 

temperature according to altitude. (Table 2.2)

Piduruthalagala

2524

11.5 0C

The decrease of the temperature according to altitude is called the lapse 

rate.

Although  Sri  Lanka  has  a  high  temperature  due  to  its  location  close  to 

the equator, the temperature decreases as it is surrounded by the ocean. But high 

temperature prevails in the regions of the interior plains in the country due to the 

low influence of the ocean.

Seasonal winds also influence the decrease of temperature in Sri Lanka. The 
temperature becomes balanced  according to the seasonal monsoons and cyclones.

Rainfall

Rainfall is the total quantity of rain received at a place within a 
specified period of time.

Map  2.5 

indicates 

the  annual  rainfall  in  Sri 

Lanka.  Accordingly, 

a 

clear  feature  shown  by  this 

map  is  the  regional  change 

of  rainfall.  Also  it  can  be 

clearly  seen  that  there  is 

less  rainfall  is  received  in 

the  Northern,  Eastern  and 

the  South-Eastern  parts  of 

Sri  Lanka  while  central 

mountains 

receive  more 

rainfall.  Sri  Lanka  receives 

rain in three ways.

1.  Convectional rain

2.  Monsoon rain

3.  Cyclonic rain

Convectional rain

Since  Sri  Lanka  is 

situated close to the equator, 

convectional 

process 

occurs throughout the year. 

However  this  process  is 

subdued  in  certain  periods 

due 

to 

the  process  of 

N

 Map 2.5 - Annual rainfall in Sri Lanka

34

For free distribution

monsoons  and  cyclones.  When  monsoons  and  cyclones  are  over,  convectional 

process re-appears. According to that, the convectional rain is experience in Sri 

Lanka prominently during two periods.

1.  The first inter monsoon period is between the months of March and April.
2.  The  second    inter  monsoon  period  is  between  the  months  of  October  and 

November

As  Sri  Lanka  is  situated  close  to  the  equator,  it  has  a  high  temperature 
throughout  the  year.  During  the  months  of  April  and  September,  the  sun  is 
overhead in Sri Lanka and the air near the surface of the earth gets heated and 
begins  to  rise. They  are  called  convectional  air  currents. The  air  that  has  risen 
up, gets cooled and the water vapour is condensed to form clouds and bring rain 
thereafter. Here, a special feature is that the rainfalls in the evenings. During the 
morning period a clear sky is visible and more heat is received. In the afternoon, 
the sky is covered by clouds and it brings rain in the evenings. These are known 
as convectional rain, thunder showers or evening showers. 

Monsoon rain

Monsoon is a specific type of winds that blow during a definite time period 
of a year across the land. Monsoon means blowing during a particular time period 
only. Sri Lanka receives monsoon rain during two time periods namely.

1. The South West monsoon   (From May to September)

2. The North East monsoon    (From December to February)

South West Monsoon rain

The wind that blows across the Indian Ocean towards Sri Lanka from the 
South West includes much water vapour. When these winds with water vapour 
reach  the  Central  Hills  and  rise  up,  they  bring  heavy  rains  to  the Western  and 
South Western parts of the country. The Eastern and the Northern areas located in 
the leeward areas of the central hills do not receive rain from these winds because 
they blow as dry winds. These dry winds are called  ‘kachchan’ in  the  areas  of 
Batticaloa.

Map 2.6 - South-West Monsoon rainfall

North East Monsoon rain

As the North East Monsoon winds blow in the direction of North-East it 
is called North-East Monsoon. Water vapour carried by these monsoonal winds is 
very low as they blow across a small water area of the Bay of Bengal from India. 
Therefore, much rainfall is not received as during South-West Monsoon. More 
rainfall is received in the North falls in Eastern parts of Sri Lanka.

Cyclones

Cyclones that affect Sri Lanka mostly occur in the area of the Bay of Bengal. 
Cyclones mostly occur in the months of November and December. But, cyclones 
may  occur  at  any  time  of  the  year.  More  areas  in  the  North  and  East  receive 
rainfall from cyclones. These cyclones enter the island from the Eastern coast of 
Sri Lanka and pass over the South Eastern coast. Whenever there are cyclones 
a large area throughout Sri Lanka receives rain. Cyclones may occur during the 
period of monsoonal winds. On such occasions, heavy rainfall is experienced and 
floods occur. Strength of these winds is introduced as whirlwinds, depressions or 
storms.

Climatic zones of Sri Lanka

An area where similar climatic features are seen is identified as a climatic 

zone. According to the factors such as temperature and rainfall, Sri Lanka can be 

divided into five climatic zones.

1.  Low country wet zone

3.   Hill country wet zone

        5.   Semi-arid zone

  zone.

 ² The average annual rainfall is between 1250 mm-2000 mm.

 ² Presence of a dry and wet period of time.

 ² During the period of December to February, this area receives rain from the 

North-East Monsoon. During this period cyclones too may bring rain.

 ² During some periods, rain is impermanent. High evaporation prevails.

Hill country wet zone

 ² The  western  part  of  this  is  formed  when  a  line  joining  the  cities  of 
  Matale, Kandy, Nuwaraeliya and Haputale of the Central Hills is drown.

Natural vegetation in Sri Lanka

Trees,  plants  and  creepers  that  grow  without  the  intervention  of  man  are 
defined  as  natural  vegetation.  The  factors  that  influence  the  growth  of  natural 
vegetation are temperature, rainfall and soil. Vegetation of Sri Lanka is classified 
mainly on the basis of the factors of temperature and rainfall. Accordingly, there are 
seven vegetation zones identified in Sri Lanka.

According to the facts mentioned above, it is clear that there is a physical 
diversity in Sri Lanka. Even in a small land, this diversity could be seen in relief, 
climate, vegetation and drainage. It is because Sri Lanka is a small island.

In Sri Lanka, there is a climatic condition that one can experience from dry 
climate  to  cold  climate. This  scenic  beauty  can  be  experienced  when  one  travels 
from  Hambantota  to  Nuwaraeliya.  We  are  able  to  see  the  diversity  in  climate, 
drainage and vegetation in a few hours. This physical diversity has contributed to 
the sustainability of the environment as well as to the constant sustainability of man. 
Physical diversity of Sri Lanka is a tourist attraction to locals and foreigners.

Assignment

Plan  an  educational  trip  to  identify  relief,  climate  and  vegetation  in  Sri 
Lanka.  Prepare  a  brochure  to  include  the  features  such  as  relief,  climate

Human landscape 
Human landscape 

Population and human activities are the main factors affecting in creation 
of human landscape.

Population  of  Sri  Lanka  is 

20.2  million.  It  increases  every 

year.  Information  on  population  is 

obtained from the census conducted 

by  the  Department  of  Population 

and Census once in ten years.

Distribution of population

Population of Sri Lanka has 

spread  unevenly.  The  Majority  of 

population  lives  in  the  wet  zone. 

In  comparison,  less  population  is 

distributed  in  the  dry  zone.  (Map 

2.10)  From  the  total  population,

For free distribution

¼  is  accumulated  in  the Western  Province  and  the  least  distribution  is  shown  in 

the Northern Province. The reasons for the increase of population in the vicinity 

of  Colombo  are  the  location  of  the  administrative  and  the  commercial  city  and 

the  abundance  of  service  facilities  such  as  health,  education,  transportation  and 

industries in the province. A low population distribution is shown in the districts 

of  Moneragala,  Vauniya,  Mannar  and  Mullatiu.  The  reasons  are  less  physical, 

infrastructure facilities and unavailability of economic opportunities in these areas. 
These  changes  in  the  population  distribution  can  be  shown  through  the  density 

quantitatively. It is depicted by Map 2.11.

This uneven distribution 

Jaffna

can  be  explained  according 

to  the  districts  and  provinces. 

These quantitative changes can 

be  shown  though  population 

density.  According 

to 

the 

population census 2012, density 

of  population  was  323  per 

square  kilometre  in  Sri  Lanka. 

This  does  not  mean  that  the 

population 

is  distributed 

in 

every  region  equally.  It 

is 

clearly  indicated  in  Map  2.11.

Composition of Population 

Composition  of  the  population  in 

Sri  Lanka  can  be  expressed  in  various 

ways such as distribution by gender, age, 

ethnicity and religion.

Distribution by sex

  According  to  the  population  census 
2012, out of the total population, 51.5% are females while 48.5% are males. It is 
clear from the data that the percentage of the males is gradually decreasing. This 
can be clearly expressed by sex ratio. The number of males for 100 females in the 
population is called the sex ratio. The following table indicates how sex ratio has 
changed according to the census reports of 1981 and 2012.

The difference between the crude birth rate and the crude death rate is called 
the natural growth of population in a particular country. When it is added to the 
net  migration  (the  difference  between  in  and  out  migration  of  the  country)  it  is 
called the growth of the total population. Graph 2.3 indicates how the population

Settlements

Settlements are established by groups of people to live together with co-operation 
to be protected from enemies and wild animals and to avoid a harsh environment.  

A settlement cannot be considered a mere habitat only. Settlement is a unit 
which  consists  of  various  institutions  of  economic,  social  and  cultural  activities 
of  man  and  religious  places,  buildings,  gardens,  agricultural  lands  as  well  as 

infrastructure facilities.

Rural settlements

The  settlements  which  are  based  on  agriculture  and  fisheries  industry, 
paying more attention on primary economic activities when using resources, are 
called  rural  settlements.  The  villages  located  close  to  tanks  in  the  dry  zone  and 
fishing villages are examples.

Economic Activities 

Economic activities of Sri Lanka 

can be divided mainly into three sections.

 ² Agricultural sector 

 ² Industrial sector 

 ² Service sector

Agricultural sector

There  are  various  agricultural 
activities  seen  in  Sri  Lanka.  Examples 
are  paddy  cultivation,  gardening  and 
chena  cultivation  in  the  dry  zone  and 
also  tea,  coconut,  paddy,  rubber  and 
vegetables are cultivated in the wet zone 
while  tea  is  cultivated  in  mountainous 
areas.  Fisheries  industry  and  livestock 
farming  too  belong  to  the  agricultural 
sector. For example, fishing industry is 
carried  out  in  the  coastal  areas  and  in 
inland  reservoirs.  Livestock  farming  is 
done in the areas of Ambewela, Pattipola, 
Polonnaruwa and Hambantota.

Industrial sector

Industrial sector 

Most  of  the  industries  in  Sri 
the  Western 
in 
Lanka  are 
located 
types 
Province.  There  are  various 
industries.  Among  such,  main 
of 
industries  are  assembling  industries, 
plastic, 
textiles,  confectionery 
and  handicrafts.  The  government  has 
also  established  Industrial  Zones  in 
Sitawaka, Polonnaruwa, Ratmalana and 
Minuwangoda and Free Trade Zones in Biyagama, Katunayaka and Koggala.

Service sector

Service sector is important for the improvement of living standards of people 
in  a  country.  Service  sector  includes  various  services  such  as  education,  health, 
transportation, electricity, water supplies, security, sanitary and communications. 
Contribution of the service sector is increasing with reference to employment in Sri 

Lanka. Service facilities are mostly expanded in urban areas.

Infrastructure facilities  

During the recent times, special attention has been focused to develop the 
infrastructure facilities to promote the living standards facilities of people. Among 
them, building roads, providing electricity and water are major. 

When developing infrastructure facilities, a prominent place has been given 
to the road development and transportation. This field is developing at a rate between 
5%  -  6%  annually.  The  road  system  has  spread  in  every  region  so  that  there  are 
facilities for anyone to reach any place in the country within a day. In urban areas, 
although the road system is developed, the congestion is still there. Recent governments 
have taken various steps to develop the field of road transportation like;

 ² Widening roads

 ² Building fly-overs

 ² Building roads in the rural sector

 ² Building express ways

Electricity

Almost  all  the  regions  in  Sri  Lanka  have  been  provided  with  electricity 

facilities.  Electricity  is  generated  from  the  electricity  projects  constructed,  in 

association with the major rivers of Mahaweli, Kalu, Kelani and Walawe. Hydro 

electricity and thermal power are major ways of providing electricity in Sri Lanka. 

In addition, the use of regenerative energy sources like solar power is increasing.

Water

Sri  Lanka  is  a  country  rich  with  the  water  resource.  Water  sources  like 

rivers, streams, wells, ponds, tap water and ground water are used to fulfil the needs 

of water of the people. Water taken from these sources is used for different simple 

purposes like cooking, drinking, sanitary needs and also for complex necessities 

such  as  agriculture,  industry,  and  generation  of  electricity.  Economic  affairs  and 

living needs of people depend on water. 

Water sources which are used to fulfil these needs are getting polluted at 

present. In urban areas, tap water is important for drinking purposes. Wells, ponds 

and tanks are important in rural areas in this regard. Importance of water sources 

has been decided depending on particular areas.

Water  and  electricity  are  limited  resources  not  only  for  us  but  for  many 

countries in the world. It is our duty and responsibility to get the maximum use of 

this resource, without wasting to protect it for the future generations.

In  the  above  lesson,  we  studied  that  human  activities  are  determined 
according to different types of environments. With the increase of population, the 
uses of physical environment and resources too increase. Accordingly, influences 
that affect the physical environment too increase. Human activities influence the 
physical environment in Sri Lanka.

Spatial Changes 
of Development in 
Sri Lanka

Development is a continuous process. It differs from 
country to country and from region to region. Different 
indicators are used to measure development. The main 
objectives of this chapter are, identifying the indicators and 
examining the spatial changes of the development in Sri 
Lanka, based on these indicators. 

Development

Development is the improvement of the quality of life of people in economic, 
social and cultural aspects. There are many different definitions of Development. 
The UNESCO declaration on development is, 

1 9 7 8  

-

  U N E S C O   D e c l a r a t

i o n

In a country social development should take place along with 

economic development. Social development should take place 

within sectors encompassing food and nutrients, health, education, 

housing, social security, clothing, leisure and human freedom.

According to this definition, development means, giving a better standard 
of living to the people of a country with improved economic, social and cultural 
standards. The definition of Development changes from time to time. Development 
changes  from  region  to  region  and  from  country  to  country.  There  are  several 
indicators to reflect these changes.

Indicators used to measure Development 

Different countries utilise different indicators to measure Development in 

the world. The following indicators are important among them, 

01.

02.

  03.

Per capita income 

Infant mortality 
rate 

Life expectancy

 at birth 

04.

Literacy 

Living conditions of people and how it differs from region to region can 
be made clear using these indicators. Such regional changes can be identified as 
spatial changes. 

Per capita income 

The amount of money that is being earned per person in a country in a given 

period is called per caprita income.

68

For free distribution

 
 
 
 
It is calculated as given below;

Per Capita Income =

 Total income of t he country      

       Midyear population 

Income  of  the  population  of  the  country  can  be  calculated  by  this 

indicator. If the per capita income rises in a country, people can have the benefit 

of good living conditions. 

Infant mortality rate

Infant mortality rate is the number of deaths of infants under the age one 

year per 1000 live births. Infant mortality rate of a country reflects the health and 

medical facilities and level of nutrition level in a country. 

Life expectancy at birth 

Life  expectancy  is  the  average  time  a  new  born  is  expected  to  live.  The 

condition of health facilities and their distribution in a country, food and level of 

nutrition, good health practices, distribution of facilities for sports and leisure of the 
country can be identified by these indicators. 

Literacy 

Literacy is the ability of reading and writing of individuals above 15 years 

of age. This is calculated as a percentage of the whole population over 15 years old. 

Number of people above 15 years of age who has ability to 

    Literacy =

read and write             

 x 100 

The total population over 15 years old

Literacy indicators reflect the distribution of facilities of schools, education 

and poverty.

Spatial variations in Development in Sri Lanka 

Sri Lanka is a developing country but regional differences also can be seen. 

Let us examine these differences according to each indicator. 

Per capita income can be used to understand the uneven distribution of the 
income of people within Sri Lanka regionally. Monthly per capita income in 2009 

in Sri Lanka is about Rs. 36,451. Table 3.1 depicts the regional differences in the 

country.

There are regional differences even in life expectancy. The life expectancy 

of the whole population of Sri Lanka is about 74.2. This differs according to the 

gender. Life expectancy of women is 78.6 while it is 72 of males. When considering 

the life expectance rate of different districts, these changes can be clearly understood.

It is clear that there are differences regionally according to the indicators 
of literary rate. Although Sri Lanka has a higher literacy rate among South Asian 
countries, there are changes in according to various districts. (Graph 3.1)

Environmental Balance

 The objective of this unit is to study the importance of 
maintaining the environmental balance, unfavourable 
effects of the imbalance of the environment and the 
way how the environmental ethics pave the path for the 
sustainable development.

Environmental balance

The surrounding that is created by biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) 
components is environment. While plants and animals of this environment belong 
to the living part, solar energy, air, water, soil, land forms, rocks etc. belong to the 
non-living part. These living components maintain mutual relationships with the 
non-living components in the eco system. The environmental balance depends on 
this relationship.
Importance of maintaining the environmental balance

All  plants  and  animals  living  on  the  earth  are  called  the  bio-community. 
Maintenance  of  the  environment  where  bio-community  lives,  while  protecting 
the  environmental  attributes  by  reacting  to  the  changes  that  naturally  occur  is 
environmental balance.

Interactions occur between  plants and animals. Those living beings maintain 
relationships with the physical environment. The environmentalists consider man 
too  as  an  essential  component  of  the  environment.  Similarly  the  environmental 
factors too influence the activities of the living beings; activities of living beings 
too influence the environment. Maintenance of this mutual balance of influence is 
important for the existence of living beings.

Factors causing the collapse of environment balance

All  living  beings  (plants  and  animals)  including  man  get  their  basic  needs 
fulfilled  from  the  physical  environment.  The  environment  is  composed  of  the 
components which are linked to each other. A change that occurs in one component, 
causes to changes in the whole environment.

Man utilizes the physical environment in different ways for the following needs;

 ² To Fulfil the basic needs like food, clothes, costumes and housing

 ² For transport and communication

 ² For trade

When  population  increases,  the  needs  as  well  as  their  complexity  too 
increase. Hence due to the use of modern technology and increase of production, 
man has to go a speedier journey, surpassing the environment.

During the period when the traditional agriculture was the main economic 
activity  of  man,  the  impact  on  the  environment  was  minimum.  However,  after 
the  industrial  revolution,  the  impact  of  man  on  environment  became  acute.  The 
damage caused to the environmental balance due to the expansion of agriculture 
and industries at a rapid speed along with modern technology was immense. The 
environmental  balance  began  to  collapse  due  to  the  excessive  addition  of  waste 
material to the environment and adverse effect on the components of it.  Collapsing 
of the environmental balance in this manner is termed as environmental imbalance.

Factors that cause environmental imbalance

 ² Excessive utilization of resources
 ² Irregular development processes
 ² Excessive burning of fossil fuel
 ² Use of agro-chemicals

 ² Deforestation
 ² Reclamation of low lands
 ² Irregular utilization of land
 ² Employment of improper technology

It  is  clear  that  such  processes  which  are  carried  out  targeting  the  development 
of  a  country  have  damaged  the  environmental  balance.  Though  development  is 
essential,  it  must  be  achieved  while  protecting  the  environmental  balance  with 
minimum damage to the environment.

Activities

1.  State three human activities that cause environmental imbalance.

2.  State three problems that have emerged due to such human activities in an 

area in your District/ Province.

 Unfavorable effects of collapsing of environmental balance

Unfavorable  effects  that  occur  due  to  the  collapse  of  the  environmental 
balance affects the whole environment on the earth. At present, as never before in 
the human history, the earth’s environment has faced a severe crisis. Scientists and 
environmentalists have warned that if the present environmental damage continues 
further, around another 200 years, the earth will convert into a condition which is 
not conducive for man and other living beings to live.

Figure 5.2 - Unfavourable effects of the collapsing of environmental balance  

Human  activities  are  the  root  cause  for  most  of  these  environmental 
problems. All the countries in the world must corporate to find solutions for these 
problems.

Necessity of environmental ethics

Favorable habits which are necessary to maintain the environment in a 
desirable manner are called environmental ethics. 

Ethics are bound with personal behaviour. They are accorded to the standard 
rules and regulations, customs and traditions followed by the people in the societies 
where  they  live.  Man  has  acted  inquisitively  since  he  began  to  deal  with  the 
environment. Then, he used to treat natural environment and natural objects which 
have created in the conducive surrounding for living with devotion and respect. Man 
who lived then, received knowledge about the environment as he worked basing on 
beliefs, faiths and religions. Faiths and beliefs like respecting trees and creepers, 
protecting them, making offerings and beseeching for the protection of the guardian 
deities of the forest when entering to the forest are linked to the religious and social 
life. 

Since  ancient  times,  as  man  considered  the  environment  as  essential  for 

survival, he began to worship and protect it.

Likewise, man lived with nature in harmony and protected it. It is important 
to  identify  the  necessity  of  environmental  ethics  as  strategies  of  environmental 
conservation, in the journey towards sustainable development. If it is necessary to 
maintain the environmental balance, we must adjust to the strategies mentioned in 
environmental ethics. Every religion has highlighted the importance of protecting 
the environment.

Sustainable Development

The development that is conducted fulfilling the present needs while building 
an environment that ensures the rights of fulfilling the needs of future generations 
could be termed as sustainable development.

The necessity of having a sustainable development approach in preparing 
development  plans,  is  of  paramount  importance.  In  following  such  an  approach, 
more attention must be focused on environmental ethics as well. The present day 
development  problems  prove  that  in  sustainable  development  both  environment 
and development must be maintained in collaboration. There, the attention must be 
focused on the ability of the future generations to fulfil their needs.

Due  to  the  lack  of  sufficient  attention  paid  to  the  environment in  present 
day,  when  large  scale  when  development  projects  are  done,  there  is  a  danger  of 
collapsing the environmental balance.

          Different national level as well as international level procedures have been 
followed to protect the environmental balance.

Under the national conservation plan the following procedures have been followed;

 ² Planning of land use

 ² Conservation of wild life and forests

 ² Promotion of agriculture without damaging the forests, water and soil

 ² Coastal conservation

 ² Launching environmental educational programme

 ² Establishment of the Central Environmental Authority

 ² Establishment of the Ministry of Environment

Two Acts have been passed to protect the environmental balance in Sri Lanka

 ² Coastal Conservational Act

 ² National Heritage Forest Act

Procedures that have been taken at international level

 ² Ramzar Convention on the conservation of wet lands

 ² Montreal Convention aiming at the protection of the ozone layer

Under  this  situation,  the  concept  of  sustainable  development  clarifies  the 
guideline  about  the  factors  on  which  utilization  of  resources  must  be  based  on. 
Accordingly, while fulfilling the needs of the present generation, the environment 
must be secured for the needs of the future generations too.

Reading of 1:50 000 
Topographic Maps of 
Sri Lanka

Physical features and human or cultural features of a landscape 
is presented by maps. It is expected to study the physical and 
cultural features presented in the topographic maps of Sri Lanka 
in this unit.

1:50,000, Topographic maps of Sri Lanka

You have studied the scale, size of a topographic map as well as selected 
physical  and  cultural  features  presented  in  a  topographic  map  in  grade  eight.
Ninety two  map sheets have been prepared to the scale of 1: 50 000 to show the 
topographic features of Sri Lanka. The key that consists of conventional signs and 
symbols shown in the lower margin of the outer border of the map sheet can be 
used to read physical and cultural features presented in these topographical maps. 
Identify the convectional signs and symbols shown in the lower margin of the outer 
border using a 1:50 000 topographic map found in your school.  

So  far  you  have  studied  that  relief  features  are  presented  in  1:50  000 
topographic maps by contour lines. Topographic features can be easily identified 
by understanding the distribution of contour lines.

All things built on the physical environment by the intervention of man are 

called cultural features.

2.  After studying map 5.1 thoroughly, name the physical and cultural features 

used from 1 - 20, according to the numbers separately.

3.  Draw these features using conventional colours and symbols.

Let us identify physical and cultural features of 1:50,000 topographic map of 
Sri Lanka by studying a segment of it. 

Physical Features

Several selected physical features found in a 1:50 000 topographic maps are 

shown below.
 ² Plain
 ² Highland
 ² Main river
 ² Tributary

 ² River valley
 ² Island
 ² Point/ Head
 ² Bay

Plain  -  A  plain  is  a  flat  area  on  land. A  plain  in  a  map  can  be  identified  by  the 
widening of the gap among the contour lines. Even in a plain, small higher places 
are found scattered. Such places can be identified by a spot height. (Figure 5.2)

Highland - Regions located at higher elevation are called highlands. A highland  
can be identified in a topographic map as contour lines that are distributed close to 
each other.

River Valley - Elongated low lands located among highlands are called valleys. 
Main rivers and tributaries flow through valleys.

Main river - Massive water which flows to a lake or to the ocean across an area 
from a highland is know as a main river.

Tributary - Small water streams from which water is provided to the main river 
are known as tributary.

The relationship between physical and cultural features  

  When you read 1: 50 000 topographic maps of Sri Lanka, it is clear that there is a 
relationship between the physical and cultural features. There is a close relationship 
between  the  physical  features  such  as  relief  and  drainage  of  a  region  and  cultural 
features  such  as  housing  and  settlements,  land  tenure,  irrigation  system  and  road 
network of that particular area. Physical features have been mostly utilized when the 
administrative boundaries are determined. 
 ² Settlements are widely distributed in plains. Settlements in mountainous regions 
are distributed in low lands located in between mountain ranges and in valleys. 
 ² The  agricultural  land  use  is  distributed  in  accordance  with  the  relief  and 

drainage. This is clear in topographic maps.

 ² Paddy lands are distributed widely in river valleys in flat lands. They are also 

distributed as narrow belts along the river valleys in hilly areas.

 ² Tea cultivation in hilly areas, rubber cultivation on slopes at medium elevation 

and coconut cultivation in coastal regions and suburbs are seen.

 ²

It  is  clear  that  relief  has  influenced  the  construction  of  tanks  and  irrigation 
systems. Tanks have been built damming the rivers by constructing bunds at the 
place where they flow through the gaps in ridges. Water is supplied through the 
canals constructed following the gradient of the land.

 ² The  physical  features  have  influenced  the  construction  of  main  roads  too. 
Though the road network runs straightly on flat regions, in a hilly region it runs 
according to the relief. River valleys and river gaps have been mostly used in 
road construction.   

 ² When  administrative  boundaries  are  decided,  it  is  clear  that,  they  have  been 

based on physical features like rivers and mountain ranges.

Observe the relationship between physical and cultural features using the 

segments of topographical maps provided.

Let us build a healthy society

You are an important member of your family, school and the society. As you grow 
older your social circle enlarges.  In the early part of your life your family and your 
school has a major influence on you. As you grow older the community at large will 
influence on you and you will also contribute to the community.  Therefore, you 
must develop the skills needed to promote health in your community. 

In  previous  grades  you  have  learnt  on  promoting  a  healthy  environment  in  your 
family and school.

In  this  chapter  we  will  discuss  about  the  factors  that  affect  the  health  of  the 
community as well as health promotion and how we can contribute to promote the 
health of the community.

Our community

Our community consists of the people around us and our environment.

There are differences among individuals in a community. However their basic needs 
are the same. It is the duty of all of us to ensure that the needs of all the members 
of our community are fulfilled.

Identify the skills you need, to associate with different people in the 
society. What are the advantages of developing such skills?

Different factors affect the health of our community. Among these the maintenance  
of the health standard and the balance in the environment are very important. For 
this, we need to develop qualities like healthy attitudes, obeying rules, being ethical 
and caring about the environment.

Health of the individual

Health is a state of being free of disease and disability, and having physical, mental, 
social and spiritual wellbeing.

Physical health 

Mental health    

- The state of being free from disease and being physically 
   fit

- The ability to face challenges successfully  and be a 
   productive and happy member of the society

Social health 

         - The ability to maintain healthy relationships

Spiritual health          - To have a meaning in life, and be able to maintain healthy 

   relationships

In a healthy community each member has good physical, mental, social and spiritual 
health.

Health problems in our community

Protecting our environment as well as maintaining of our own health is necessary to 
safeguard the health of the society. Therefore all the problems related to individual 
health and the environment, can be considered as community health problems.

Some of the most important community health issues are given below 

1. Environmental pollution
2. Communicable and non-communicable diseases
3. Use of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs
4. Accidents and disasters
5. Abuse and exploitation

1. Environmental pollution

Environmental pollution is defined as the process which makes our environment 
unsuitable for living for humans and animals. Pollution alters the natural state of 
the environment.

Environmental  pollution  is  caused  by  human  actions  and  it  results  in  health  
problems.

Causes 
of 
environmental 
pollution 

• Destruction of forests
• Improper disposal of
     garbage
• Chemicals and other 
    non-degradable waste released 
   from factories
• Burning coal, fossil fuels, plastic and 
   polythene
• Haphazard use of
  agrochemicals

• Large scale, unregulated 

   construction

Preventive
methods of 
environmental 
pollution 

• Preservation of forests

• Proper management of garbage

• Enacting laws to prevent 
    environmental pollution

• Following proper standards in the 
  use of agrochemicals

• Ensuring standards when
   constructing buildings

2. Communicable and non-communicable diseases

Communicable diseases can be spread from one infected person to another 
eg: dengue, malaria, diarrhoea, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted 
      diseases.

Diseases, which cannot be transmitted from one person to another, are known as 
non-communicable diseases.
eg: hypertension, diabetes, mental illnesses, cancers and stroke.

Illness causes many problem situations like disability, reduction in level of activity, 
reduction in life span and mental distress. It also affects areas like education, work, 
day to day functioning and economic status of the individual and the country. 

We  can  prevent  illness  by  maintaining  good  hygiene,  immunization,  prompt 
treatments of illnesses, keeping environment clean and adopting a healthy life style.  

We will discuss in detail about illness in Chapter 21.

3. Use of tobacco and related drugs

Use  of  tobacco  and  drugs  cause  many  social  problems.  Use  of  them  directly  or 
indirectly results in heart disease, respiratory illness, cancers, crimes, conflicts and 
other anti-social behaviours, disrupting family relationships, disregard for cultural 
norms, mental and physical problems and reduction in life span.

Passive  smoking  which  is  inhalation  of  smoke  from  other  smokers  can  result  in 
illness. The foetus can be harmed due to inhalation of cigarette smoke by pregnant 
mothers. Therefore smoking should be banned in public places and people who do 
so should be penalized.

We need to educate the public about the negative effects of tobacco and other drug 
use, enforce laws, be aware of media portrayals, rehabilitate users and engage in 
sports  and  cultural  activities  in  order  to  prevent  use  of  tobacco  and  other  illegal  
drugs. 

4. Accidents and disasters

Figure 1.6 - Home accidents

Accidents  and  disasters  can  happen  anywhere.  Home  accidents,  road  accidents, 
animal  attacks,  occupational  injuries,  food  poisoning  and  sports  injuries  are 
examples of accidents. Floods, drought, tsunami and wars can result in disasters. 
Accidents and disasters cause injury, illness, mental distress, damage to property, 
environmental pollution and even death. 

We can prevent accidents and disasters by learning about the causes of accidents 
and  disasters,  taking  precautions  and  following  rules.  We  need  to  know  how  to 
prevent accidents and disasters and about the first-aid we can administer in such 
situations. We can reduce the negative consequences by proper intervention.

5. Abuse and coercions

Abuse  is  defined  as  behaviours  which  harm  someone,  against  accepted  social 
morals. Coercion is to encourage someone by using force or threat to engage in 
antisocial activities. 

We should all aim at getting rid of abuse and coercions from the society. You must 
develop  the  skills  necessary  to  protect  yourself  from  those  who  try  to  abuse  or 
coerce you. You must also ensure that you do not engage in activities which abuse 
or coerce others.

Sexual abuse, employing of under-aged children as domestic workers, verbal abuse, 
neglect and physical and mental abuse are examples of abuse and coercions. 

Abuse  and  coercion  can  result  in  illness,  mental  distress,  sexually  transmitted 
diseases, unwanted pregnancies and endanger the life.

Those who have been abused or coerced can be directed to various institutions that 
could help them. Department of Probation and Child Care, Children and Women’s 
Bureau desks in Police stations are examples of such institutions. These institutions 
provide safety for those who are abused or coerced and they maintain confidentiality
of information.

Community Health Promotion

Community health promotion enables people to improve their health by controlling 
the factors which influence their health.

We  can  prevent  environmental  pollution,  illness,  tobacco  and  other  drug  use, 
accidents  and  disasters,  abuse  and  exploitation  by  community  health  promotion. 
We can make use of life skills, which we learnt about previously to help us in these 
activities. 

 Activity

Display a list of life skills in your class room.

Community health promotion activities

We learnt five themes, which can be used to promote the health of our family and 
our school. We can use the same themes for community health promotion.

1.  Develop policies which promote health

This is one of the main strategies of health promotion. We need to identify the main 
factors which affect our health and develop appropriate policies. We can develop 
policies at individual, institutional, regional and national levels.

Eg: Daily exercising, maintaining a healthy canteen, providing subsidies,
        adding iodine to salt and maintaining food standards.

 Activity

Identify a few policies which can be easily implemented and promote
health in your area. Educate your relatives and neighbours about them.

2. Improve knowledge and skills 

Acquisition of knowledge necessary to cope with life and the development of life 
skills are important in health promotion. We can improve knowledge on health for 
all the age categories through schools or other educational institutions. We also can 
implement community activities, which improve such knowledge and skills.

Eg. Conducting sports competitions, aesthetic activities, health and education 
       workshops and distributing books which contain information about health.

Figure 1.8 - Health workshops

3. Create a healthy environment
The physical, mental and social environment should be healthy. It should provide 
your needs. 

Eg: Basic needs, love and protection, facilities for sports, medical facilities and 
        clean environment

4. Get help from the community

Individuals  and  the  community  must  take  responsibility  for  health  promotion. 
The entire community must contribute to health promotion. The family, schools, 
shops, work places, temples, churches, different societies etc must all contribute to 
community health promotion.

For free distribution

 
 
Eg: Shramadana activities, making the environment attractive, replanting forests, 
        conducting of health camps, dengue prevention activities

5. Reorientate and make optimal use of health services

Shortcomings of the health services should be identified and health services should 
be reorientated to meet the health needs of the society. 

Eg: Identifying shortcomings in hospitals, ensuring availability of  investigations, 
       mobile health facilities, counselling services.

Figure 1.9 - Mobile health facilities

 Activity

Discuss with your friends how you can contribute to health promotion.

Advantages of health promotion

• Reduction of communicable and non-communicable diseases
• Reduction of health care expenditure
• Ensuring a pleasant environment
• Developing good social relationships
• Minimizing conflicts
• Improved quality of life

Summary

The people and the environment around us are a part of our community. The society 
or the community consists of different types of individuals. 

It is important to ensure the health of individuals and maintain a healthy environment 
to ensure the health of the community.

Environmental  pollution,  communicable  and  non-communicable  diseases,  use 
of  tobacco  and  harmful  drugs,  accidents  and  disasters,  abuse  and  coercions  are 
examples of major health problems. 

Community health promotion is the process of enabling the people to control the 
issues which affect their health and to improve the health standard of the community. 

The  five  main  themes  of  community  health  promotion  are  developing  policies 
which promote health, developing personal knowledge and skills, creating healthy 
environments, getting help from community and reorientating and making optimal 
use of health services.

Health  promotion  results  in  economic  and  social  benefits  and  improves  quality
of life.

Let us achieve towards self
 actualization

You may have noticed that your needs have changed from simple to complex as 
you grew up from a child to an adolescent. When you were a baby your parents 
provided you with food  to satisfy your hunger and clothes to keep you warm. In 
addition to these when you could understand a little more you would have expected 
love, protection and to be provided with toys for your entertainment. Between child 
hood and adolescence other than education and self esteem you would have had 
other needs. Therefore human needs gradually change to higher needs over a period 
of time. When the basic needs are met, secondary needs  arise and when these are 
met another  level of needs arise. 

In previous grades you learnt about basic needs, phychological needs and need of 
self-esteem.

This chapter will teach you about self actualization which is a higher need than self 
esteem. Self actualization is a complex concept but try to understand it as it will  
help you in your life.

The hierarchy of human needs

Abraham  Maslow  a  psychologist  who  did  a  lot  of  experiments  on  human  needs 
described  the hierarchy of human needs shown below.

What is self-actualization?

Principal :-  

                   Mr Suranimala, the day of our  pr ize gi ving is ge tting closer,
      isn’t it? Who is going to  announce on that day? Who is going 
     to prepare the invitation cards for our invitees? We need to have 
      a pandal at the entrance and also have to decorate the hall. In 
     addition, we need to have a pooja dance and some special items. 
     What shall we do?

Mr Suranimala :-  Don’t worry about them sir I have organized everything. I have  
     chosen Jagath form grade 9 to do the announcing. He is a good 

announcer.	Jagath	did	the	announcing	at	the	flower	auction	held			
at the village temple  recently. He is doing announcing at village 
functions, too. He also did the announcing at the last year’s sports 
meet. He is capable of doing a good job.

     I have asked Kumudu to be in charge of the invitation cards. She 
     has started working on it. She does beautiful creations. Thamali 
      and Thusitha  of grade 9 will help her with it. They too can draw 
     well and have nice hand writing. It won't be a problem.

I  have  chosen  a  few  grade  10  students  to  construct  the  pandal 
and  decorate  the  hall.  Nimal,  one  student  in  this  group  is  a 
sculptor. A few others will help him to do this.  I have also made 
arrangements to get items needed to make it. They have already 
started on the work.

     We will ask each grade to present an item. We will ask the grade  
     nine students to do the pooja dance. There are some talented 
     students in that grade. They will do a good performance.

Mr Suranimala, Lal the student who won an all-island prize for  
creations should have a special place at the prize giving doesn't  
he? Let us make arrangements for the invitees to watch the  
model of the electric lift  he designed.

Principal:-  

Mr Suranimala:-   Yes sir we’ll do it that way.

Read the dialogue several times. 

You	 would	 have	 noticed	 that	 teacher	 Suranimala	 identified	 each	 person’s	 talents	
and given them fair opportunities to develop them further. After having read the 
dialogue  you  too  should  be  able  to  identify  people  with  different  talents.  Such 
abilities or talents can be divided into different groups.

Figure 2.2 - Being a professional sportsman

By  developing  one  or  more  of  your  abilities,  you  can  be  a  professional  in  that 
field.	Every	person	has	talents	that	are	unique	to	him.	These	abilities	are	inherent.	
According to the inherent strengths we have, we should identify a target and strive 
to achieve it without obstructing others. You can bring honour and glory to your 
community and the country by developing your abilities. The satisfaction, joy and 
pride you get by this is known as self actualization. 

According to the above, self actualization can be explained in this way.

“self  actualization  is  to  use  our  creative  abilities  to  serve  the  society  to  the 
maximum and lead a satisfying, righteous and peaceful life”

Despite having many talents we might not be able to identify them. If we are to 
identify our hidden talents we need to engage in different activities. There are times 
that we may not be able use our talents despite identifying them. This might be an 
obstacle  to  achieve  self  actualization. Therefore  we  should  strive  to  identify  our 
talents and look for opportunities to use them instead of waiting for such situations 
to arise. We should use our talents for the good of ourselves as well as others. The 
hallmark of people who have attained self actualization is the joy and satisfaction 
they receive for their good deeds.

The qualities needed to attain self-actualization

Despite	possessing	many	talents	one	should	have	the	following	qualities	to	reach	
self actualization.

  1. Be a master in the area studied
  2. Use talents for the betterment of society
  3. Do not engage in social work expecting

Figure 2.3 - Use talents for the 
betterment of Society (Albert Einstein)

Although self actualization was described as a complex concept, at your age as well 
as an adult you can get close to achieving it. 

Religious  leaders  such  as  Lord  Buddha,  Jesus  Christ,  prophet  Mohammed  and 
special charactors such as Mahthma Ghandi, Mother Theresa, Arthur C Clarke, Dr. 
Amaradeva, Ravindranath Tagore, Abraham Lincoln are known to have had good 
qualities	other	than	their	talents	and	reached	self	actualization.

Summary

When human needs are rated, self-actualization is at the highest level.

Every person has inborn talents and abilities. These talents and abilities are known 
as the inner strength people possess. 

Self-actualization is known as identifying our inner strengths and using them to 
serve the society to give us satisfaction and a peaceful life.

People	who	have	attained	self-actualization	have	had	many	special	qualities.

By	identifying	the	unique	talents	you	possess	and	identifying	a	goal	will	help	you

Let us identify physical 
deformities which prevent
good posture

We engage in many activities throughout the day. Each of these activities is associated 
with  a  specific  posture.  Maintaining  good  posture  is  necessary  to  carry  out  our 
tasks efficiently, for a healthy life and to have a pleasant and attractive appearance. 
Ilnesses and bad habits can lead to bad posture. Maintaining a bad posture results in 
injury and physical deformity. Physical deformities will affect  maintaining correct 
posture. Therefore, it is important to identify physical deformities early in life and 
to treat them early to develop good posture.

In previous grades we discussed about the good postures that should be adopted 
during sitting, walking and marching.

This lesson will focus on identifying deformities that would prevent good posture.

What is a good posture?

Good posture is proper alignment of the body during a movement or when in a still 
position. This enables us to carry out activities easily, efficiently and, to move our 
limbs and joints properly.

Benefits of maintaining good posture

1. Less energy is spent during an activity
2. Feels less tired during an activity
3. Increased efficiency
4. Maintains optimal physical fitness
5. Prevents illness and injury
6. Less body aches and pains
7. Becomes healthy
8. Looks pleasant and attractive

Stand in front of a mirror so that you can see your full body. Hunch 
your body by rounding your shoulders, hanging the hands in front and 
extending  the  neck  forward.  Observe  yourself  in  this  position.  Then 
adopt the proper posture for standing which you learnt in Grade 7. See 
the difference in appearance.

You may have observed that, when you are in the proper posture your appearance 
is more attractive.

Deformities which prevent good posture

Deformities can occur due to;
1. Congenital factors
2. Environmental factors

These conditions can be acute (short term) or chronic (long term).

Deformities caused by Congenital factors

These  diseases  can  arise  due  to  genetic  defects  or  due  to  harmful  conditions, 
which affect the foetus.  Genetic defects are inherited. Infections and nutritional 
deficiencies during pregnancy are factors which can affect the foetus. The features 
of congenital diseases are present from birth. 

Eg: Genetic defects leading to abnormalities in bone and muscle development.

Deformities caused by environmental factors

Unhealthy  habits,  improper  life  style,  nutritional  deficiencies,  diseases  and  bad  
posture are environmental factors that can cause physical deformity.

1. Nutritional deficiencies 
    Nutritional deficiencies can affect bone and muscle growth.

Eg:
• Vitamin D is needed for growth and maintenance of bones. Vitamin D deficiency  
    prevents  proper  absorption  of  calcium. Vitamin  D  deficiency  during  childhood 
   causes rickets. In rickets the bones become weak. This can result in fractures 
   and deformity. People living in cold countries who have inadequate exposure to 
   sunlight can develop vitamin D deficiency. It is not very common in Sri Lanka. 
   Vitamin D deficiency can arise due to improper diet and also due to renal diseases. 

•  Calcium and protein is essential for bone growth. Calcium and protein deficiency 
   during childhood can slow bone growth and cause deformities. In adults, calcium 
   deficiency causes osteoporosis. This leads to weakening of bones, bone pain and 
   fractures. 

2. Diseases
    Bones and muscles can be affected by different diseases

Eg:
• Bone infections
• Osteoporosis caused by hormone imbalances

3. Bad posture
   Prolonged use of bad posture during daily activities and wrong posture        
    adopted during use of equipment can cause injury. 

Eg:
• Incorrect postures of sitting and standing

muscles and improve functioning of the affected parts.

The Medical Officer of Health (MOH) clinic or the hospital can advice regarding 
nutritional deficiencies. 

Special  Sport  Medicine  units  provide  advice  and  treatment  for  sports  related
injuries. 

A healthy lifestyle can prevent most of the environmental causes. 

Healthy behaviours which can prevent bad posture and other
skeletal conditions

1.Taking a balanced diet
2. Exercising daily
3. Getting adequate sleep and rest
4. Maintaining weight appropriate for height (BMI) for age
5. Correcting hearing and visual defects
6. Adopting correct posture during day to day activities
7. Maintaining good mental health

Good posture makes us attractive and enables us to carry out our work efficiently.

Disease conditions can interfere with good posture.

Physical  deformities  can  occur  due  to  congenital  or  environmental  (acquired) 
causes.

Congenital diseases can arise due to genetic defects or due to harmful conditions,

Let us identify organized
games and outdoor activities

In order to become a healthy student, it is essential that you get involved in sports 
in addition to taking a balanced diet. When you get involved in sports and excel 
in  it  you  will  get  the  opportunity  to  participate  in  various  sports  competitions 
representing your school and even your country depending on your talents. Getting 
involved in sports is very important to improve your physical, mental and social 
wellbeing and also to develop your personality and physical fitness.

When you were previous grades, you gained knowledge about organized games, 
lead-up  games, minor games and athletics. You also gained happiness,  enjoyment 
and experience by getting involved in sports. 

After  studying  this  lesson,  you  will  be  able  to  classify  organized  games  and 
outdoor  activities. You  will  also  gain  understanding  about  how  getting  involved 
in such activities contribute towards enhancing one’s physical and psycho-social 
development.  

Sports

In the ancient times man lived in very close relationship with the natural environment. 
While carrying out his day to day tasks like hunting, he had to do activities such as 
running, jumping and hitting with a stone or a stick. Such activities required man to 
perform basic movements which were later used in sports. With the emergence of 
civilizations after the hunting era, man had more leisure time and sports were used 
as an effective way of spending it. Various types of sports that were created in this 
manner have developed into different games with rules and regulations.

There are wide geographical variations on the earth. Accordingly, there are marked 
variations in the natural environment. A wide variety of sports based on the variations 
of the natural environment have been created. Apart from that, a wide variety of 
sports have also been created based on various social and cultural environments.

Organized games can be classified based on a variety of criteria. In this classification

the advancement of technology, man has got used to live in a house. Further, as 
a  result  of  industrialization,  man  designed  various  types  of  machinery. With  the 
invention of such machinery, man stopped doing natural, manual work and began 
to use machinery to get easily done his day-to-day work.

Now we don't live in a natural environment as the ancient man did, but outdoor 
education will enable us to gain experience about the natural environment and to 
develop skills needed to protect and conserve it.    

Outdoor  education  is  not  merely studying  about  the  environment; many outdoor 
activities have been designed under outdoor education. Under outdoor education 
you can engage in activities like camping, campfire games, explorations into jungles 
and forests and making of fireplaces. Participation in such activities helps you to 
develop your physical, psycho-social and life skills.

Summary

Sports that are played by following a set of rules and regulations are called organized 
games. Organized games can be classified based on the place where the games are 
held and the equipment used. 

Outdoor education is to understand the true nature of the environment by using the 
natural environment outside the classroom. There are many activities that can be 
done in order to fulfill this. These activities, too, can be classified in a number of 
ways. 

Exercise

1. Define the term “organized games”.
2. Name the sports that are played in Sri Lanka and classify them.
3. List the benefits that can be gained by engaging in outdoor activities.

Let us play volleyball

Volleyball is a popular game all over the world and is a compulsory game in all 
schools in Sri Lanka. Volleyball is a less expensive game and it can be played in 
a  small  area.  There  are  six  main  skills  in  volleyball,  namely  serving,  receiving, 
setting, spiking, blocking and defending. 

You may remember that, you have learnt the skills of serving, receiving and setting 
when you were in the previous grades.

In this grade you will learn the skills of spiking and blocking.

Volleyball – Introduction

In a game of volleyball, there are twelve players in each team. Among them, one 
or two are nominated as libero players. During the play, six players take part. Out 
of them, three players should be positioned in the front and the other three should 
be positioned at the back. They are called front-row players and back-row players 
respectively.

A team gets the opportunity to choose a libero player as one out of six. The libero 
player acts as a back-row player, but there are restrictions and rules on how a libero 
player is allowed to play.    

Spiking

Spiking  can  simply  be  defined  as  hitting  the  ball  that  is  above  the  net  so  that  it 
goes straight over the net on to the opposite side. Except for serving and blocking, 
any other action which directs the ball towards the opponent can be considered as 
spiking.  

Spiking can be described in several stages for easy understanding of the technique.

Figure 5.1 - Spiking 

Approach

• Reaching the part of the court where the ball is up in the air in order to hit the ball 
   is called the approach.  

Take-off

•  After reaching the area of the court under the ball, jumping up towards the ball 
    is called take-off.

•  When taking off, first the knees are bent and the body is leaned downwards. 

•  Swinging the two hands backwards as the body moves downwards helps make 
    an easy take-off. 

•   Together with the take-off, the body should be bent backwards like a bow and the 
    two hands should be brought upwards from the front of the body.

Hitting the ball

• The hitting hand should be brought back over the head and the ball should 
    be hit as the body is brought forwards very fast. 

• When hitting the ball, the hitting hand should be well straightened and should hit  
    at the highest possible level.      

• When hitting the ball, the free hand should be held freely at the level of the head 
    in front of the body. 

• The eyes should be focused on the ball.  

Landing

After hitting the ball, the player should land on the ground maintaining the balance  
of the body by bending his knees.

Factors that should be taken into consideration when spiking

• While spiking, the ball should not be caught or thrown.
• Should not hit the ball while the ball is in the opponent's side.
• After hitting, the ball should land on the opposite side of the court.
• A front-row player can hit the ball at any height within the player’s own playing  
   space.
• But a front-row player cannot hit the ball that is served, when it is completely 
   above the top level of the net. 
• A back-row player can hit the ball at any height, from the back zone. 
• A back-row player may also hit the ball from the front zone, but at the time at least 
   a part of the ball should be below the top level of the net.
• On any occasion, a libero player cannot hit a ball that is above the top level of the 
   net. 
•  No player in the same side can hit the ball that is lifted by the libero player in the 
   front zone, if it is completely above the top level of the net.

Blocking

Blocking is obstructing the ball coming from the opposite side, when it is above the 
net, by a front row player, before it enters their side.

Only front-row players are permitted to block. At the time the blocker is in contact 
with the ball, a part of the body of that player should be above the top level of the 
net. 

In order to secure victory in a game of volleyball, blocking the ball is as important 
as spiking. Blocking, which is an action that should be done against the spiking of 
the opponents, should take place at the same time the ball has been spiked. When 
the ball is hit by the opponents, the challenge can be reduced by blocking it at the 
net.  Therefore,  as  a  volleyball  player,  you  should  diligently  practise  the  skill  of 
blocking.

The technique of blocking, too, can be described in several steps:

Factors to be considered for effective blocking

• A blocker should not touch the ball that is in the opponent’s side before an 
   opponent hit the ball.

   has been spiked by an opponent. 

• Blocking cannot be done by a back-row player or the libero player.

Summary

For a game of volleyball, a team requires six players – three front-row players and 
three back-row players. 

Both the skills of spiking and blocking are very important in order to secure victory 
in volleyball. 

Spiking is to hit the ball that is in the air above the net to send it to the opposite side. 
Spiking can be described under four stages, namely approach, take-off, hitting the 
ball and landing. 

When the ball is coming from the opponent’s side, obstructing it before it enters the 
other side is called blocking. Blocking is done in four stages namely, preparation, 
approaching the ball, taking-off and contacting the ball and landing.

Rules of spiking and blocking should be followed in order to execute a successful 
spiking or blocking. 

You can develop these skills by engaging in simple practice activities. 

Exercise

1. Execute the spiking and the blocking by following their techniques step by step.
2. Write three factors for each, to be taken into consideration when spiking and 
    blocking.

Let us play netball

Netball was initially a very popular game among girls, but at present even boys 
play netball and there are also mixed events where both girls and boys play for the 
same team. 

You  remember  that  when  you  were  in  previous  grades  you  have  learnt  several 
netball skills and engaged in activities that help to develop ball controlling skills by 
catching the ball, holding the ball and throwing the ball.

In this grade, you will learn skills that are important in passing the ball. For that, 
let us practise in the playground the three skills, namely attacking, defending and 
shooting. 

Attacking

A game of netball begins with the centre pass. From the centre pass up to shooting, 
the ball should be passed between the players of a team, strategically avoiding the 
players  of  the  opposing  team  and  a  goal  should  be  scored  by  shooting  the  ball. 
Passing the ball in this manner is called attacking. 

While the ball is being taken to the netball post by  a team by  way  of  passing  it 
between players, the players of the opposing team try to prevent the players of that 
team from receiving the ball. Therefore, activities should be designed to practise 
skills in attacking so that players learn to pass the ball avoiding their opponents.    

Defending

The aim of defending is to restrict and delay the opportunity for the players of the 
opposing team to get a goal by shooting the ball after it has been passed among the 
members of that team. 

Defending can be done as follows.

1. defending the player
2. defending the ball
3. defending the position

47

For free distribution

1. Defending the player

Preventing the attacker from catching the ball is called as defending the player. This 
can be done in four methods.

  ¸' Standing in front of the attacker

 ¸¸' Standing behind the attacker

¸¸¸' Standing beside the attacker

 ¸¹' Standing opposite the attacker

2. Defending the ball 

When defending the ball, the defender 
should identify the landed foot of the 
player  who  has  received  the  ball  and 
should  prevent  the  ball  from  being 
thrown  by  standing  face  to  face  with 
the ball 3 feet away from that landed 
foot  of  the  player  with  the  ball.  The 
defender  should  obstruct  throwing  of 
the  ball  by  the  attacker  by  extending 
her  hands  according  to  the  throwing 
direction. As  the  attacker  is  throwing 
the ball, the defender can jump up and 
catch the ball as it is released from the
hand of the attacker.

3. Defending the position

After  passing  the  ball  to  an  another 
player  of  the  own  team,  the  attacker 
moves  to  a  free  place.  Preventing 
the  attacking  player  from  moving  in 
this  manner  is  called  defending  the 
position.

Shooting the ball

The victory of a game of netball depends on the number of points a team scores. A 
point is scored for each correct shooting. Practise the shooting techniques following 
the steps given below. 

• Place the ball on the palm of the dominant hand, raise that hand above the head   
    and stand with the feet shoulder-width apart or with one foot in front so that the 
    body is positioned upright. 
• Keep the free hand on the ball as a support to the ball.
• Focus the eyes on the ring of the netball post.  
• Bend the knees slightly while keeping the body in an upright position and shoot 
   the ball as the body is raised straitening the knees. 
• The ball should be released from the hand at maximum possible height.

Summary

In  netball,  the  three  skills,  namely  attacking,  defending  and  shooting  are  very 
important. 

A game of netball begins with the centre pass. From the centre pass up to shooting, 
the ball should be passed between the players of a team by strategically avoiding the 
players of the opposing team and a goal should be scored by shooting it. Carrying 
the ball in this manner is called attacking.

Restricting and delaying the opportunity for the players of the opposing team to 
get a goal by shooting the ball after it has been passed between the members of the 
team is called defending.

Throwing the ball from within the shooting circle following the correct technique 
is called shooting.

Various activities can be used to develop the above mentioned skills.

Attacking, defending and shooting should be done following the relevant rules and 
regulations.

Let us play football

Football is one of the most popular games in the world. A football team consists of 
11 players and it is played in a rectangular field. The victory of a football match is 
decided on the number of goals the teams score within a period of 90 minutes.

When  you  were  in  the  previous  grades,  you  gained  theoretical  knowledge  and 
practical  experience  about  the  skills  of  kicking  the  ball,  stopping  the  ball  and 
heading the ball.  

In this lesson you will get the opportunity to learn the skills of throw-in and goal 
keeping, which are two important skills in football. 

Throw-in

In football, throw-in is a method of restarting play. 

When a football match is being played, a throw-in is used to bring the ball back to 
the court when the ball has gone out of the court across the side line. 

The opponents of the player who last touched the ball before it crossed the side line 
get the opportunity for the throw-in from the place where the ball crossed the side 
line.

A goal cannot be scored directly from a throw-in.  

The ball should always be thrown-in from outside the court. The opponents must 
stand not less than 2 meters from the point at where the throw-in is taken. After the 
ball is released, the thrower should not touch the ball again until it has touched an 
another player. 

technique of throw-in

• The thrower should be facing the field of play at the moment the ball is released.
• Both feet of the thrower should be behind the side line, with one foot behind or 
    apart.
• The ball should be held in both hands and thrown from behind over the head. 
• The body should be bent backwards and as the body is straightened again, the 
    hands should be brought forwards and the ball should be released.

Goal Keeping

Out of football skills, goal keeping is a very important skill because the victory of 
a match depends on the number of goals scored. Preventing the ball from entering 
the goal is called goal keeping. By goal keeping, the opponents can be prevented 
from winning goals. Only the goal keeper is allowed to touch the ball with the hand. 
The goal keeper should be clad in a colour that is different from that of the other 
players of his team.

Methods  of  goal  keeping  vary  based  on  the  ways  the  ball  reaches  the  goal. 
Accordingly,  keeping  the  ball  that  is  coming  towards  the  goal  is  done  in  the 
following ways:

1. Keeping of the ball that is coming along the ground from the front.

Figure 7.5

Out of the methods described above, let us now learn how to goal keep when the 
ball is coming along the ground and at chest level or stomach level. 

Technique of goal keeping

• The goal keeper should stand on the goal line with legs about shoulder-width 
   apart maintaining body balance. 
• Hands should be bent at the elbows and should be positioned on the sides of the 
   body above shoulder level.
• The knees should be bent bringing the body downwards and bending the body 
   slightly forwards. 
• The goal keeper should stand on the balls of the feet so that it is easy to move. 
• When the goal keeper is in this position, he can easily move to the left, to the 
   right, forwards or backwards.

58

Figure 7.6

For free distribution

Keeping of the ball that is reaching along the ground 

• The goal keeper should be prepared with the correct technique.
• Then he should reach the path of the ball and should stand with the legs close 
   together.
• As the ball comes closer, the keeper should lower the body bending from his 
   knees.  
• The eyes should be focused on the ball.
• The fingers of the hands should be spread and the ball should be held with both 
   hands.
• As the keeper straightens the knees and raises his body, the ball should be lifted 
   towards his chest. 

Keeping of the ball reaching at chest level or stomach level

• The keeper should be prepared according to the correct technique.
• Eyes should be focused on the path of the ball and the keeper should be 
   positioned with the legs slightly apart according to the path the ball takes.
• The body should be bent slightly forwards by bending the knees according to 
   the path the ball takes and the ball should be brought close to the chest or 
   abdomen. 
• When the goal keeper is in this position, his elbows should be slightly bent so 
   that it is easier to catch the ball. 
• Soon after holding the ball it should be brought close to the chest.

Summary

When the ball has gone out of the court across the side line, the skill of throw-in is 
used to bring the ball back to the court.

It is important to learn the throw-in technique, activities that can be used to practise 
throw-in and rules and regulations related to throw in.

Preventing the ball from entering the goal is called goal keeping. 

Methods  of  goal  keeping  vary  depending  on  the  ways  the  ball  reaches  the  goal. 
Such ways are the ball coming along the ground from front or from a side, at chest 
level or abdomen level, above head level and the ball that cannot be caught by hand. 

You can engage in activities in order to learn how to keep the goal, adopting the 
correct technique.

Let us train for relay - races

Out of athletic events, relay race is an event where the  runners take part as teams. 
Therefore, many runners get the opportunity to participate in the same event at the 
same  time.  In  a  relay  race,  four  runners  take  turns  in  running,  changing  a  baton 
and victory can be achieved through the skills of all the four runners of the team. 
Maintaining  of  a  maximum  running  speed  throughout  the  race  and  changing  of 
the  baton  correctly  and  efficiently  are  very  important  factors  in  relay  races.  For 
a correct baton change, it is essential that runners have a good training and good 
understanding among them.

When you were in the previous grades, you engaged in various running exercises in 
order to improve  the running technique. 

In this lesson, you will get the opportunity to learn the upsweep technique and the 
downsweep technique of baton change in relay races, and how the inside change, 
outside change and the mixed change are done, and also how the visual pass and 
the non-visual pass are done.

Baton change techniques    

There are two techniques of baton change according to the way the baton is  
handed over by the runner who is carrying the baton to the next runner. 

1. Upsweep technique
2. Downsweep technique

Upsweep technique

In the upsweep technique of baton change, the baton is swept upwards by the giver. 
The receiver stretches the hand behind so that the palm faces downwards and gets 
hold of the baton.

Figure 8.1 - Upsweep technique

Downsweep technique

In  the  downsweep  technique,  the  giver  sweeps  the  baton  down.  The  receiver 
stretches his hand behind turning the palm of the hand upwards and gets hold of 
the baton.

 Activity

Under the guidance of your teacher, engage in practice activities
together  with your friends in the class to practise the upsweep technique
and the downsweep technique of baton change. 

Baton change can once again be divided into three types base on the side of the 
body from which the receiver receives the baton.

1. Inside pass
2. Outside pass
3. Mixed pass

Inside pass

In the inside pass method, the receiver receives the baton in his/her left hand (on the 
inside of track). The giver carries the baton in his/her right hand.

Outside pass

Figure 8.3 - Inside pass

In the outside pass method, the receiver receives the baton in his/her right hand (on 
the outside of the track). The giver carries the baton in his/her left hand.

Mixed pass

In a relay race changing the baton both with the inside pass and the outside pass in 
turns is called the mixed pass. The mixed pass is suitable for a 4 x 100m relay race 
run in a 400m track.  

Relay races of different distances are held. Passing the baton is done in two 
ways based on the distance of the race. 

1. Visual pass
2. Non-visual pass

Visual pass

If the receiver looks at the baton when receiving the baton in a relay race, it is called 
the visual pass technique. In this method, the receiver positions the hand so that the 
palm faces upwards. This method is used in relay races of 4x400m and above.

Non-visual pass

If  the  receiver  takes  the  baton  without  looking  at  the  baton  in  a  relay  race,  it  is 
called the non-visual technique. This method is used for short distance relay races, 
namely 4x100m races and 4x200m races.

The following activities can be used to practise the upsweep technique, downsweep 
technique, inside pass, outside pass and the mixed pass.

› Get into groups of four and stand in lines as shown in the figure 8.7 so that there 
   is sufficient gap between two students in each line to change the baton.
› Begin from the student in the back of the line who gives the baton to the third 
   student in it, the third to the second and then the second to the first in the front.
› Practise doing these activities, first standing in the same place, then walking, next

 Rules for baton change

1. The baton should be exchanged directly from hand to hand. It should not be 
    thrown.
2. If the baton slips and falls down while it is being exchanged, the runner who 
    handed over the baton should pick it up and give it to the receiver. The receiver 
    should not pick up the baton.

3. Before or after the baton has been exchanged, lanes should not be obstructed so 
    that the other runners are disturbed.

4. The baton should be carried in the hand throughout the race.  

5. The baton should be exchanged only within the baton exchange zones.

Summary

Out of athletic events the relay race can be called a team event. 

Baton change is a very important factor in relay races. There are two techniques of 
baton change, namely the upsweep technique and the downsweep technique based 
on the direction the baton is swept when changing.

Baton change can be divided into three types, namely inside pass, outside pass and 
the mixed pass based on the side of the body from which the receiver takes the 
baton. 

In relay races, baton change is done in two ways, namely the visual pass and the 
non-visual pass, as appropriate for the event. 

You should engage in practising activities for successful baton change.

Let us practise long jump 

According to the classification of athletic events, long jump is a horizontal jump 
that comes under field events. Speed, strength and coordination, which are different 
factors of physical fitness, are very important for gaining victory in long jump event.  

When you were in grade 8, you learnt the different phases of the long jump under 
the sail technique and you also engaged in activities related to this technique.  

In this lesson, you will learn the different phases of the long jump under the hang 
technique and will get opportunity to engage in activities to practice it as well.

Techniques of Long Jump

There are three techniques of long jump based on the way the jumper manages his 
body during the flight:  

1. Hang technique
2. Sail technique
3. Hitch-kick technique

Phases of long jump

Each technique of long jump consists of four phases.

1. Approach run
2. Take off
3. Flight
4. Landing

73

For free distribution

The hang technique of long jump

Figure 9.1 - The hang technique of long jump

This technique is called the hang technique because the jumper, after taking off, 
makes the flight with his/her hands raised as if he/she is raising hands to hang on a 
support that is lying above.  

When the long jump is made according to this technique, a very fast and rhythmic 
approach run should be made up to the take-off board lifting the knees high.

• The take-off foot should be placed correctly on the take-off board and the take off 
   should be made properly in order to make the flight.  
• Then the two feet should be brought forwards and upwards, and the two hands 
   that were at the back should be brought forwards. 
• Then the body is bent forwards and the landing is done.
• As the two feet touch the landing area, the knees are bent and the body is pushed 
   forward along the ground in a sitting position.

Occasions which are considered as failiures in a long-jump event

• Touching the ground beyond the take-off line with any part of the jumper’s 
    body while taking off for the long jump. 

• Taking off by placing the take-off foot on the ground outside the two sides of the 
    take-off board.

• Making somersaults while running or while jumping.

• Not starting to attempt jumping before the lapse of one minute after the 
   number of the jumper has been announced. 

•  After landing, walking back towards the take-off board along the landing area.

Let us fulfill our nutritional 
needs

If we do not get the required amounts of nutrients from food we may get various 
illnesses  and  our  body  will  become  weak. Therefore  to  prevent  getting  diseases 
and to maintain a healthy life we need to know about the nutrients in food and the 
different stages in life we need them most. 

In  the  previous  grades  you  would  have  studied  on  the  nutrients  needed  for  life, 
problems with nutrition, food pyramid, nutrients required for the family, points to 
consider when selecting food, consuming and storage of food so that the nutrients 
are not destroyed.

In this lesson you will learn about the different nutrients needed during different 
stages in our life cycle, nutritional needs in special groups, various myths regarding 
nutrition and how you could contribute to choose nutritious food.

Our nutritional needs

Food provides our body with energy, repairs our body and protects our body from 
various diseases. The different nutrients found in our food help to do this work. 

The main nutrients needed in our body are carbohydrates, proteins and lipids.
The micro nutrients needed in our body are vitamins and minerals.

Food can be divided into six groups depending on the nutrients it supplies.

1. Grains and yams
2. Vegetables
3. Fruits
4. Meat, fish and eggs
5. Pulses and seeds
6. Milk and milk products

A balanced diet is one with the right amount of each nutrient that should be provided 
by  food.  It  is  important  to  have  three  main  meals  and  two  supplementary  meals 
that are well balanced. When preparing a balanced meal you can make use of the 
knowledge gained in previous grades from the food pyramid and the food plate.

Nutritional needs  of an infant

This is the period from birth to one year. During the first two years the brain, bones, 
muscles and connective tissues show intense growth.

The following nutrients mentioned below are needed for this.

• Proteins 
• Carbohydrates 
• Fats   

• Minerals - Calcium, Iron, Zinc
• Vitamins

All these nutrients are needed at optimal levels.

Until six months of age only food for the baby is breast milk and all the nutrients 
are supplied by it. During this period the baby’s nutrition as well as the mother’s is 
very important. After six months of age complementary feeding is started. This is a 
gradual introduction to solid food.

of the utensils used to prepare the food.

Nutritional needs during childhood

Childhood  is  the  period  between  one  year  and  ten  years.  During  this  stage  the 
nutritional requirements for boys and girls are the same. However, on the level of

activity the nutritional needs may differ. A child engaged in sports will need foods 
that provide energy.

During this stage as the amount of food consumed at a meal is limited, it is important 
to have two or three snacks in addition to the three main meals.

There  is  adequate  growth  and  protection  from  illnesses  when  nutritious  food 
is  provided  for  the  children.  When  adequate  nutrition  is  not  provided  there  is 
malnutrition.

Research  has  shown  that  illness  such  as  diabetes  and  obesity  can  set  in  during 
childhood  when  healthy  dietary  habits  are  not  followed.  To  prevent  non 
communicable diseases in later life it is important to have healthy dietary habits 
during childhood.

Child  and  maternal  health  programmes  have  been  implemented  to  reduce 
malnutrition in childhood.

• Promotion of breastfeeding
• Giving adequate nutrition to sick children
• Providing adequate and healthy supplementary foods
• Monitoring growth
• Initiating child friendly hospital programmes
• Providing vitamin A mega dose
• Providing food packets fortified with micronutrients to children under two 
   years of age, in areas where there are nutritional deficiencies
• Providing supplementary food to children with malnutrition eg: Thriposha
• Providing special food for children with severe malnutrition

In addition to the three main meals people are used to have a snack around 10am 
and 4pm. During pregnancy in addition to the two snacks, several snacks can be 
consumed in between meals. This is because it is more comfortable to eat in small 
amounts in pregnancy.

The pregnant mother should be reviewed by the midwife. The midwife will educate 
the mother on the nutritional needs. In addition, the mother will be given vitamins, 
minerals and medicines to prevent certain diseases.

It is important to know about the development of the foetus as the mother gains 
weight gradually during pregnancy. The BMI of the mother is checked before 10 
weeks at the maternal clinics. After which the weight is checked at the clinic to see 
if  there is adequate weight gain.

Nutritional needs of a breast feeding mother

After child birth the glands in the mother’s breast are activated and milk is produced. 
This is known as breast milk. The importance of breastmilk is shown below.

• Provides natural immunization
• Reduces allergies
• Free of germs
• All the required nutrients are provided
• Necessary amount of water is provided

• Can be given in a hygienic manner
• Can be given to the baby at any moment

Figure 10.8 - Breast feeding

During the first six months after birth, the baby gets nutrition only from breastmilk. 
Therefore, the mother should have good nutrition to provide the baby with all the 
necessary nutrients and water.

A breast feeding mother makes about 850 ml of milk per day. The milk contains 
a large amount of calcium. Thus the mother should take extra calcium. Additional 
meals and water should also be taken. The meals should contain macro and micro 
nutrients.

Special nutritional needs for a sportsman  

Nutrition  is  important  for  all  but  a  sportsman  has  to  pay  more  attention  to  his 
nutrition than others. By paying attention to his nutritional needs his sporting skills  
can be improved, dehydration can be prevented and his wounds will heal faster. A 
sportsman needs more calories than an ordinary person.

A sportsman needs lipids and carbohydrates for his energy requirements. During 
extra training additional proteins are needed. Proteins are needed for the growth 
of tissues and muscles. Salts and extra carbohydrates are needed to prevent muscle 
fatigue. Lipids are needed to provide energy when engaging in training for long 
periods.

The control of weight is also important when such nutrients are taken in this manner. 
This should be done under the supervision of a coach.

eg: swimmers and gymnasts should be strong but also light weight. In boxing and 
      weight lifting strong muscles are needed.

To prevent dehydration adequate water should be drunk and if engaged in vigorous 
exercises or activities adequate energetic food and salts should be consumed.

Advantages for a sportsman when getting proper nourishment

1. Helps to perform optimally 
2. Body will become stronger
3. Will be healthy
4. Good control of weight
5. Development of mental faculties
6. Body composition and  growth will improve

Nutritional needs of a sick person

All  sick people have to be given food as adviced by the doctor.

The food provided to a patient should be of proper nutrition. If there is a nutritional 
deficiency the food given has to be one that corrects the deficiency. A patient has 
to  be  given  food  at  the  correct  time  and  in  correct  amounts. The  food  has  to  be 
prepared with less oil, chillies and sugar. Food can be given as solids, semisolids or 
liquids as necessary.

Nutritional needs of a vegan 

Vegan is a person who takes only food of plant origin and they should pay special 
attention to their nutritional needs. It is difficult to gain all the  essential amino acids 
needed for the body by vegetarian foods. To complete this, a diet mixed with grains 
and pulses should be consumed. 

In addition, vegans can get the required calcium and protein by drinking milk. Milk 
products like cheese, panneer, curd, yoghurt, and other dairy products should be 
consumed daily. Vegans  should consume coconut milk, oats, soyamilk and almond 
milk as a substitute for animal milk. 

Growing  up  children  should  preferebly  not  be  exclussive  vegans. Although  you 
take substitute food you cannot gain all the nutrients by a vegetarian meal.

Myths regarding nutrition

There are lots of programmes regarding looking after  our health and improving of 
the standard of living. Despite these you come to know about cases of nutritional 
deficiencies and people falling sick. One of the main reasons for this is the myths 
and beliefs people have regarding nutrition. Find below are such myths and ways 
of overcoming them.

Table 10.4 

Myth

Fact

All  the  expensive  food  for  sale  in  the 
shops have a very high nutritional value.

The  nutritional  value  of  the  food  
cannot  be  estimated  by  the  price. 
The  nutritional  value  depends  on  the  
nutrients,  freshness,  cleanliness  and 
hygiene of the food. Due to the addition 
of  artificial  flavours  and  preservatives 
sometimes  the  nutritional  value  of 
expensive food can be reduced.

Myth

Meat based food provide all the 
nutrients needed for the body.

Breast milk secreted initially should be 
cast  aside.  It  is  the  milk  secreted  after 
this that should be given to the baby.  

Fruits that are big are more nutritious

Jambu  and  mandarins  should  not  be 
given to small children
A larg body indicates good nutrition

Big  fish  have  more  nutritional  value 
than small fish

Most  food  items  are  known  to  cause 
phlegm, gall or wind. These food make 
you sick

Green  leafy  vegetables  should  not  be 
eaten in the night

Pregnant mothers should not eat small 
fish

Fact
Proteins,  minerals,  vitamins,  amino 
acids  can  be  found  in  vegetables  too. 
eg:  grains,  mushrooms,  tofu,  leafy 
vegetables 
It is very important that the baby gets the 
initial secretion of mother’s milk known 
as colostrum as it is very nutritious and 
gives immunity to the baby.
The nutritional level is not high due to 
the  size  of  the  fruit  which  could  have 
extra water or more cells for the size. 
These should be given as they have a lot 
of vitamin C and minerals 
Having a large body does not mean the 
person is healthy. In diseases as well as 
due  to  unnecessary  nutrition  the  body 
can be large. 

Flesh  of  small  fish  is  as  nutritious 
as  big  fish.  In  adition  all  of  small 
fish  are  also  consumed  when  eating 
small  fish. Therefore  we  can  get  more 
of  micronutrients  such  as  calcium, 
iron,  zinc.  Bones  of  large  fish  are  not 
consumed,  so  the  nutritional  value  is 
less. 
Certain  foods  can  be  allergic  only  to 
some people. Therefore food cannot be 
commonly  labelled as  unsuitable.

No matter what time of the day you eat 
the green leafy vegetables the nutrious 
value remains high 
Small  fish  contain  protein  as  well  as 
a  large  amount  of  micronutrients.  The 
unborn  baby    in  the  mother’s  womb 
gets the nutrition through the umbilical 
cord.

How can we contribute to fulfill our nutritional needs

It is important that we have a good knowledge of  the food we purchase and our  
nutritional requirements.

1. Buying food to suit each individual.

Eg: An obese person should select food that has less carbohydrates, fats and proteins. 
     People who have or have a family history of hypercholesteraemia should avoid 
     food that has a lot of fat ( especially animal fats).
     People who have skin diseases or falling hair should increase amounts of  
     vegetables and fruits in their meals.

2. When buying canned, bottled or packeted food you need to be aware of the  
     date of expiery, ingredients and the standards certificate.

Figure 10.12 - Checking date of expiery and ingredients of the food

3. Choose natural foods over artificial or processed food. 
    Natural food is fresh and has more nutritional value and does not have toxins 
    compared to artificial food.

5. When purchasing fish it's better to buy small fish than big fish. Make sure     
    the gills are  red and the eyes of the fish are glistening.

6. Do not buy cans and tins that are crushed, dented or ballooned as they can   
    have toxic chemicals in them.

9. When preparing food, use methodology and ingredients that increase its 
    nutritional value

    Eg:   Soaking gram prior to cooking.

Preparing greengram and cowpea after sprouting.
Eating different coloured food.
Adding grated coconut, lime juice, maldive fish to green leaves.
Preparing a dish with different types of food.
Avoid drinking tea, coffee immediately after meals.

Let us protect the features which 
affect our appearance

Our  body  is  a  wonderful  biological  creation  made  to  live  and  continue  life.  Its 
our responsibility to lead a healthy life protecting appearance which contributes to 
personality.

In  the  previous  grades  we  studied  about  the  basics  of  our  sensory  organs  such 
as  ears,  eyes,  nose  and  skin  as  well  as  the  digestive  system,  respiratory  system, 
circulatory  system  and  the  excretory  system. We  also  studied  about  maintaining 
healthy organs. 

In this chapter we will study about the organs such as skin, hair, teeth, lips, eyes and 
ears that help in the external appearance. We will learn how to keep them healthy 
and factors that cause them to be unhealthy.

Skin

The  skin  is  the  largest  organ  of  our  body.  It  protects  our  whole  body,  covers  it, 
gives it a shape and the external appearance. Depending on the purpose it shows 
adaptations. The skin is thick where it is exposed to friction, e.g soles of the feet 
and palms of the hands.

The hair follicles in the skin protects the body. The skin regenerates and gets rid of 
old skin 
eg: keratinized layer. 

Skin is different in each person. People have dry, oily, sensitive or normal skin . 

Functions of the skin 

• Gives an external appearance to the body
• Protects the internal organs
• Helps in getting rid of excretory material e.g sweat
• Controls the internal body temperature- when cold the skin protects the body by 
   conserving heat
• As a sensory organ the skin reacts to heat, cold and pain from the external 
   environment
• Helps in producing vitamin D from sunlight

Figure 11.1 - Skin related diseases

Healthy ways of preventing skin diseases

1. Take nutritious food

The skin should be supplied regularly with all the nutrients it needs. Foods contains  
Vitamin A, D, minerals and proteins should be consumed. 

2. Drinking adequate amounts of water

Water is necessary to maintain good functioning of the body as well as  a healthy 
skin. Water prevents drying of the skin and makes it bright.

3. Keep your skin clean

Skin can be kept clean by bathing daily or having a body wash twice a day. Quality 
products should be used for the skin. Obtain medical advice when using types of 
bactericidal soap as they can harm the useful bacteria present on the skin.    

101

4. Protect the skin from harsh sunlight 

Early morning sunlight helps in producing vitamin D but very strong sunlight which 
has  ultraviolet  rays  can  be  harmful  to  the  skin. The  skin  can  get  burnt  in  strong 
sunlight. It is important to wear protective clothing to protect yourself from strong 
sunlight. Falling of sun rays directly on the skin can be prevented by wearing white 
coloured clothes which reflects the sun rays and by carrying an umbrella. If you 
are getting exposed to strong sunlight it is advisable that you wear a sun protection 
cream as prescribed by a doctor. 

5. Protect from accidents

You should  try to minimize injury to your skin due to falls, pricks, cuts and burns. 
Some injuries remain as scars on the skin for a long period of time.

6. Refraining from applying unnecessary makeup, creams etc

You may want to try various types of makeup and creams from different countries 
and  institutions  advertised  on  the  internet  and  social  media  to  make  you  look 
younger. You have to be careful as they may cause not only discolourations in the 
skin but also other diseases due to chemical toxins entering in the blood.

If  you  need  to  apply  such  creams  etc  obtain  medical  advice  and  use  approved 
products.  School children should refrain from using unnecessary makeup.  

Hair

Hair on your head is meant for protection and appearance. It should be kept healthy. 

Hair minimizes injuries to the head. Hair protects the brain which is a valuable organ 
placed inside the skull. Hair of infants help to maintain their body temperature by 
reducing the loss of heat through surface area of the head.

Your hair grows and some falls off.

The live section of the hair follicle is in the skin despite the length of the hair shaft. 
The section above the skin is not live. Therefore, the hair can be combed and styled 
as desired.

5. Wash hair well after using a cleanser

6. Use standard hair products

7. Prevent doing artificial hair styles

As a student it is important that you maintain your hair in its natural state.  

Nails

Nails are formed by the thickening of skin on the fingers and toes. Nails are formed 
to protect finger tips and toes as they are constantly in friction when performing 
various tasks.

The squamous layer of the skin is not alive, so is the tip of the nail. The start of the 
nail on the finger is known as the nail root or matrix and this has life. The same way 
the skin regenerates so does the nail root or matrix.

Teeth

Teeth are helpful when having food, to break food into particles for easy digestion, 
for  the  shape  and  fullness  of  the  face,  when  pronouncing  sounds  and  for  the 
personality.

Teeth start to erupt after about 6-9 months of a child’s birth. These first teeth are 
known  as  milk  teeth  or  deciduous  teeth.  From  6-12  years  of  age  these  teeth  fall 
off and new teeth erupt in place. The new teeth that erupt are known as permanent 
teeth. The teeth erupting at two different times is a unique feature of man. This is 
known as diphyodont.    

Man has a set of 32 permanent teeth with 16 each in the upper and the lower jaws. 
This is known as dentition.

 Additional knowledge

The  main  reason  for  discolouration  of  teeth  is  dental  fluorosis.  If  the  water 
fluoride  level  in  your  area  is  high,  there  is  a  risk  of  dental  fluorosis.  Dental 
fluorosis at severe level can be seen in areas like Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa 
and Hambantota.

It occurs during the stage of development of permanent teeth inside the jaw (from 
birth to 8 years of age). If you use the deep ground water in deep wells and tube 
wells which contain high fluoride for drinking and cooking purpose you can get 
fluorosised teeth.

If you are living in an area endemic for dental fluorosis;  

      -  Check the level of fluoride in your water source. You can get assistance of 
         the Public Health Inspector in your area or National Water Supply and 
         Drainage Board.

-  Use a fluoride filter to filter the water and use the filtered water for drinking 
   and cooking.

Healthy ways of looking after your teeth 

  1. Consume food rich in minerals and calcium

  2. Other than the main meals refrain from eating at all times. Reduce the 

consumption of sweets, soft drinks, junk food, sticky food

  3. Avoid eating very cold or very hot food

  4. Brush your teeth every morning and night before going to bed. It is very 
      important at least to rinse your mouth after eating sweets or sticky food. 

  5. Use a tooth brush that has small head with soft bristles 

  6. Use a standard tooth paste that contains fluoride in required quantity 

  7. It is not recommended to use coarse items such as sand, charcoal or tooth 

powder to brush your teeth.  

  8. Brush correctly to clean all the sides of the teeth

  9. It is not recommended to use your teeth for harmful purposes like to break 

bottle tops, bend  or break wire or cut glasses.

11. Get the state of teeth checked by a dentist at least once a year

12. Make it a habit to examine your own mouth to detect for any changes in the oral 

cavity.
- It may be a decayed tooth, swollen gums, calcified plaque, any growth or 
   change in colour of oral mucosa.  
- If you detect any abnormality seek dental advice. 

13. If from birth, your teeth are positioned in an irregular way, you should see a 

dentist and get it corrected.  

14. Seek dental advice immediately after a dental or oro-facial trauma even though      
      the damage is not visible or is small. 

 Additional knowledge

Following a trauma, saving of a completely dislodged permanent tooth depends 
on the way of handling it immediately after the injury. In such a case,

-  Never wash or clean the tooth using disinfectants.
-  Never touch the root area of the tooth.
-  Hold the tooth by the crown, and rinse the tooth for 10 seconds under 

          running (tap) water to remove debris.  

-  Place the tooth in a solution of preferably fresh milk, saline or patient's 
   saliva. 
-  Visit the closest dental clinic as soon as possible. 

The Success rate is high if you can replant the tooth within half an hour.   

Eyes

The sensory organ that help us see is the eye. The fact that we can see an object at 
once with both eyes is known as binocular vision. Objects can be viewed in three 
dimension with both eyes as well as can judge the distance to the object. Due to this 
we can judge what we can see to do delicate work precisely.

Figure 11.7 - Binocular vision

The eye brows and the lashes are placed to protect the eyes from foreign bodies or 
germs. The eye brows are placed above the eye and slightly forwards. 

If a foreign body enters the eyes the eye lashes start blinking very fast and works 
towards getting it out. If the object is still present the tear glands start to secrete 
tears and the object comes out. 

If an object is about to strike the eye, instantly the eye closes and it reduces  any 
injuries to the eye. 

Diseases related to the eyes 

• Red eye, secretions, sties
• Colour blindness, night blindness
•  Short sightedness, long-sightedness and blindness
•  Irregularities
• Disfigurements.
• Nutritional deficiencies 
   eg: bitot’s spots
• Cataract
• Glaucoma
•  Squint - it is important to consult an eye surgeon to know if this is a disease 
   state. Otherwise it could result in blindness.

        other liquids, substances or home remedies. Always follow medical instructions 
      when using eye drops.

10. Choose sunglasses, contact lenses and spectacles as advised by your eye 

surgeon. Spectacles should be changed at least every two years after seeking 

  medical advice.

   Do you know?
 ³ There are small torches that emit infra-red waves being sold at shops. It is 

important that you use it solely for the intended purpose and not expose the rays 
directly on the eye.

 ³ During an eclipse never look at the sun directly. Keep a basin of water or a sheet
like a x ray sheet and view the sun if needed.  Looking directly at the sun can 

      harm your eyes.

Ears

The  ear  is  the  sensory  organ  that  you  need  to  hear.  Let  us  have  a  look  at  some 
natural protective mechanisms of your ear.

 Wax is made internally to protect the ear. Wax is made  
 from the secretions in the external ear.

 The eardrum which is an important organ is placed in
 some what internally

 The pinna or external portion of the ear is protruding  
 outwards to be able to catch the sounds and direct them
 to the inside of the ear

 The internal ear and the throat are connected  by the  
 Eustachian tube. This tube makes the pressure in the 
 atmosphere and the internal ear equal

 It Helps in maintaining the  balance

Diseases related to the ear  

• Infections of the external ear
• Due to middle ear infections the ear drum can get pierced, there will be a 
   discharge from the ear and the balance of the body will be affected. 
• Infections of the inner ear will result in damage to the nerves and hearing would 
   get affected.

Good practices to maintain health of the ears

  1. Avoid introducing objects into the ear.  

The ear wax will naturally get expelled from the ear. Introducing of external 
objects such as ear candles or pins can harm the ear drum. Infections can set in 
      and injuries  can occur. If the ear drum is damaged the hearing will be affected.

  2. Do not get exposed to very loud noises.

  3. Do not use mobile phones or earphones for a long period. 

  4. If you have an illness related to the ear, nose or throat, obtain help from a doctor 

specialized in that area. 

  5. If you have a cold, as your ear can be affected get your ears checked by a doctor.

  6. If you have poor hearing get treatment - Speech can also be affected if hearing 
      is affected

Fingers and toes

• Power grip and precision grip are special features in the human fingers. 

   Power grip means the ability to hold firmly using the large muscles of the hand.

  Precision grip helps in holding an object or doing a task and is  done using the 
   small muscles of the hand. 

• The opposing thumb is a feature of primates. The thumb can be moved so that it 
    can be placed opposite the other fingers and can perform similar tasks of other four 
   fingers.

• The tips of the fingers and toes have a lot of nerve endings and is able to feel 
   sensations.
   eg: sensation of heat, cold, pain

• There are lines between the phalanges in the fingers and toes.  These help 
   to cause friction. Therefore when you hold something with your fingers they are 
   gripped firmly due to the friction.

• The nails  placed at the tips  of the fingers and toes gives protection to them.

 Additional knowledge

In many criminal cases the law  gets the finger prints to catch the criminal. This 
is because  no two people will  have the same type of finger prints.

Instances where the fingers get injured

• When using the knife or sharp objects
• When fingers and toes are caught in machines
• When using the hammer 

Ways of protecting the fingers and toes

1. Pay attention and take care when using knives, hammers and scissors

2. Keep your fingers, toes and nails clean

3. Do not wear gloves, shoes and boots for longer periods  

Summary 

The skin, hair, nails, teeth, eyes, ears and lips are parts of the body that make our 
appearance. There are  good practices to  keep these clean and healthy.

The skin is the largest organ in the body and it has a lot of uses. The skin protects 
the internal organs and protects the body. The skin should be kept clean and healthy.

The hair which protects the head should be kept clean as this will prevent diseases 
and give a healthy appearance to a person. 

The nails are placed at the tips of the fingers and toes should be kept clean and 
protected. 

It is important to protect our lips that protect the internal aspect of the body and 
makes up the external appearance of our face.

It is important to protect our permanent teeth too, as they arise just once during our 
lifetime.

Our eyes that gives us binocular vision should be kept healthy and protected. 

The ear that helps us hear should be kept without diseases.

Let us develop health 
related physical fitness

Physical  fitness  is  the  ability  to  perform  physical  activities  effectively.  As  you 
already know, physical fitness is divided into two main categories as skill related 
physical fitness and health related physical fitness. Health related physical fitness 
factors directly affect our health. There are five main health related physical fitness 
factors  called  cardiovascular  endurance,  muscular  endurance,  muscular  strength, 
flexibility and body composition.

In grade 8 you identified health related physical fitness factors which are important  
to maintain a healthy lifestyle and engaged in activities which improve them.

In this chapter, we will learn about ways of measuring physical fitness. By performing 
these tests you can get to know how to maintain your fitness at an optimal level.

Health related physical fitness tests

These tests can be performed in many ways. With the development of technology 
these tests are performed using various instruments both in and outside research 
labs. The simple tests we use in Sri Lanka can be done also in the playground. 

These results help to understand the health state of a person and accordingly can 
improve health related physical fitness. These can also be used for people starting 
new sports to choose the sport best suited for them.

Getting ready to measure fitness factors

In order to measure fitness factors divide the class into four groups. Get each group 
to measure and note the results. Arrange the measurement in each category from 
the highest to the lowest  of all the students in the class. Grade  the values into five 
groups.

1. Very good
2. Good
3. Average
4. Satisfactory
5. Poor

to achieve higher grades.

Pay attention to the three steps below and  organize a programme to test the level 
of fitness. 

1. Preparation before the test
2. Carrying out the test
3. Analysis after the test

Instructions to be followed when performing tests to assess fitness 
levels

•  Prepare the field so that accidents and injuries are minimized. 

•  Prior to the test make sure the participants do warming up exercises.

•  After the test, make sure they do exercises to warm down.

Follow the instructions above and perform tests to assess each factor.

Measuring cardiovascular endurance

Cardiovascular  endurance  is  the  ability  of  the  heart  and  respiratory  system  to 
function properly and supply adequate amounts of oxygen to the muscles.

Summary

Health  related  physical  fitness  affects  our  health  directly.  There  are  five  factors 
considered  in  health  related  physical  fitness.  Different  tests  are  used  to  measure 
these factors.

Cardiovascular  endurance  is  the  ability  of  the  heart  and  respiratory  system  to 
function properly and supply adequate amounts of oxygen to the muscles. This is 
measured by 800m and 600m non stop running.

Muscular endurance is the  ability of the  muscles to work for a long time without 
getting fatigued. Doing pushups is a way of measuring muscular endurance.

Muscular  strength  is  the  ability  of  a  muscle  to  generate  force  when  doing  some 
work. The standing long jump test is a way of measuring muscle strength.

Flexibility is the ability to move or stretch through the joints. Stand and reach test 
can be done to measure the level of flexibility.

Body  composition  is  the  components  that  the  body  is  made.  The  two  main 
components  are,  fat  component  and  fat  free  component.  Measuring  body  mass 
index and waist to height ratio, give an idea  about the body composition.

Let us be familiar with
knots and lashings

Engaging in outdoor activities helps learn how to enjoy the natural beauty of the 
environment and, when faced with challenging situations, how to respond to such 
challenges.  Doing  knots  and  lashings  is  an  important  skill  that  is  involved  with 
outdoor activities. Different types of knots and lashings are used in order to fulfil 
day-to-day tasks more easily and effectively. If you are a Scout or a Girl Guide you 
may have already gained some knowledge about knots and lashings.  

By now, you have gained knowledge about classification of organized games and 
outdoor activities from Lesson 04. 

From this lesson you can gain knowledge about knots and lashings which will be 
useful in various situations when engaged in outdoor activities.

Importance in gaining knowledge about knots and lashings

In our day-to-day activities we have to carry out various tasks which require doing 
knots or tying things with ropes. On some occasions where we need a very long 
rope, we may have to join together two or more pieces of ropes. In such situations, 
if we do not tie the knot properly to join the pieces of rope, the knot will get loose 
and undone when the rope is pulled tightly from either end. Further, if knots and 
lashings are not done properly, it could lead to accidents. What type of a knot do 
you use to tie up your shoelaces? The type of knot you use should be one that can 
be  undone  easily. Accordingly,  possessing  a  proper  knowledge  about  knots  and 
lashings is vital for carrying out of day-to-day activities more easily and effectively. 

 Activity

Take a piece of rope or string of about one meter in length, and engage 
in practicing different types of knots that you use in day-to- day 
activities.  

125

For free distribution

Characteristics of a good knot 

• A knot should be able to stand the weight or the pull of the required task.
• A knot should be able to be undone as required. 

Different types of commonly used knots and lashings

1. Reef knot
2. Sheet bend
3. Bowline knot
4. Clove hitch
5. Square lashing
6. Shear lashing

1. Reef knot

Figure 13.1

Reef knot can be used to tie together two pieces of ropes of similar type. Reef knot 
is also used when putting a shoulder sling. Being able to tighten quickly, being able 
to undo quickly, and having a flat nature are the characteristics of the reef knot.   

Let us learn to do the reef knot

• Take the ends of the two ropes in the two hands.

• Place the rope in the left hand over the rope in the right hand. 

• Take the rope end that has come to the right hand side with the right hand and 
   bring it up from under the rope on the right.

126

For free distribution

• Bend back the rope end that is in the left hand and place it under the rope end that 
   was in the right hand.

• Now a loop has been created with a rope end extending to the right.

• Put that rope end on the right through the loop bringing it over the rope of the loop 
   and pull it in the opposite directions.

When this knot needs to be tightened, the shorter strand and the longer strand on 
either side should be held by the two hands and the two ends should be pulled in the 
opposite directions. Similarly, in order to loosen the knot, the two strands on either 
side should be held in the two hands and should be pushed forwards.  

2. Sheet bend

Figure 13.2

Sheet bend is very useful to join ropes with different thicknesses. 

Let us learn how to do the sheet bend.

• First bend an end of one rope and make a bight with it.

• Hold that bight in the left hand and take an end of the other rope in the right hand.

• Now put the rope end in the right hand under the bight and push it up through
   the bight.

•  Now take the end that was pushed through the bight and push it under both strings 
    of the bight.

• Now take that end and push it through the bight again from under the 
    same string.

• Hold the four strings with the two hands and pull them in opposite directions.

3. Bowline knot

Figure 13.3

When engaged in tasks that involve a risk to life, bowline knot is used to keep the 
body tied to a safe place in order to ensure the safety of life. For example, this knot 
is used when a person climbs to the top of a very tall tree to cut down its branches. 
When a certain object has to be kept pulled hard and tied to something, the bowline 
knot is used for that, too. For example, this knot can be used to tie a clothes line. 

Let us learn how to tie the bowline knot

• Take a rope and tie a knot at one end.

• Now take that end and make a bight.

•  Push the end of the rope through the bight making a noose to the required size 
    and take the end of the rope round the string of rope and push it through the bight 
    once again and pull hard.

4. Clove hitch

Figure 13.4

The clove hitch is used to tie a rope tightly on to a log. What is important about this 
knot is that the knot does not slip on the log. The more you pull the rope, the further 
this knot gets tightened. Clove hitch is used to tie a rope to the handle of a bucket 
and to tie poles of scaffoldings together. 

Let us learn how to tie the clove hitch

• Stand before a vertical pole with a gap of about one foot between you and the 
   pole and hold the rope with the two hands (This gap may vary depending on the 
   diameter of the pole).

•  The end of the rope that is in the right hand should be brought around the pole 
    from the right to the left from behind the pole and it should be pushed under the 
    string of rope in the left hand. Now bring the rope around the pole once again as 
    done earlier making a round below the previous encircle.

•  Finally, push the end of the rope through the space between the pole and the 
   starting point of the second round of the rope and pull the strings of rope in 
    opposite directions.

5. Square lashing

Figure 13.5

Square lashing is used to tie two poles that are put together crosswise. In day-to-
day life, square lashing can be used in activities such as making a kite or making a 
Vesak lantern. 

Let us learn how to do the square lashing.

• Put two poles together crosswise as shown in the figure above. 

• Then take one end of the rope and tie the clove hitch on the bottom pole close to 
   the place where the two poles cross each other. 

• Then wrap the rope around both poles as shown in the figure so that the two poles 
   are tightened together.

•  Finally stop wrapping the rope using the clove hitch again.

6. Shear lashing

Figure 13.6

Shear lashing is a type of knot that can be used to tie together two poles as shown 
in the figure.

Let us learn how to do the shear lashing

• Take two poles and tie the clove hitch on one pole. 

•  Then wrap the rope around both poles tightly.

•  Now push the rope between the two poles and wrap it around the tie several times 
   in order to frap it tightly.

•  Now complete the shear lashing by tying the clove hitch once again on a pole.  

Summary

Knowledge about doing knots and lashings are considered to be very useful when 
engaging in outdoor activities. 

Various  types  of  knots  and  lashings  are  used  to  fulfil  the  day-to-day  tasks  more 
easily and effectively. When using knots and lashings, they should be done to suit 
the occasion and the purpose.

The  reef  knot,  sheet  bend,  bowline  knot,  clove  hitch,  square  lashing,  and  shear 
lashing are different types of knots and lashings that are used in day-to-day activities.

14 Let us enjoy making bonfires

Ancient man considered fire to as divine and therefore performed various rituals in 
honour of God of Fire. Woodsmen who used to eat fruits of trees, yams and meat in 
raw form, got accustomed to boil or roast them after discovering how to make fire. 
Since then fire has been an essential thing in our lives. We need fire to cook our food 
and for various other activities in our day-to-day life.  

In the previous lesson you gained knowledge about knots and lashings which are 
useful in outdoor activities as well as in your day-to-day activities.

From this lesson you can gain knowledge about how bonfire displays can be used 
 as an effective means of spending leisure time.

Occasions where bonfires are used

The following are examples for occasions where a bonfire is made.

1. During outdoor activities
2. In night camps
3. In scouting camps
4. During excursions 

Factors that should be taken into consideration when building a bonfire

When making a bonfire it would be dangerous to do it without planning. There are 
several factors that should be taken into consideration when making a bonfire.

1. Permission should be obtained from the owner or the relevant authorities of the 
    land in which the bonfire is expected to be built.

2. Climatic and weather conditions should be taken into consideration.

3. People in the immediate surroundings should be kept informed.

4. Firewood required for the bonfire should be collected prior to the day on which 
    the bonfire is made.

5. Valuable timber should not be used for making the bonfire.

6. If insects are found on the pieces wood, they should be removed.

  7. When the bonfire is burning, the participants should not be wearing dresses of 
      which any part is likely to be blown by the wind.  

  8. Keeping a wet sack, water baskets, and some fresh foliage ready for use in an 
      emergency situation. 

  9. It should be ensured that the bonfire that is built is not too large.

 10. After the event is over, the bonfire should be put out properly and the place   

should be cleaned well.

11. Safety of all participants should be ensured.

How a bonfire should be made correctly

• Clear the area where the bonfire is planned to putup.

• If there is grass in the place where the bonfire is made, sods of turfs should be cut 
   off from the ground and placed aside.

• Put up a safety wall around the fire using big logs.

• Make an entrance using wood as shown in the figure 14.1 leaving space to go 
   near the fire.

Figure 14.1

Figure 14.2

• After that, take some pieces of wood and lay them on the ground in the center of 
   the area surrounded by the safety wall as shown in the figure 14.2. 

• Lay some sawdust, hay, dried grass, wood shavings, or thinly torn pieces of dried 
   coconut sheaf on the pieces of wood laid on the ground. 

• Then pile up the firewood properly on the pieces of wood that have been arranged 
   on the ground. When piling up the firewood, enough space should be left between     
   pieces of wood.

Types of bonfires

Bonfires  are  given  different  names  as  follows  based  on  the  way  the  pieces  of 
firewood are piled up for making the bonfire.   

1. ‘A’ fire

2. Reflector fire

3. Rectangular fire

4. Pyramid fire

‘A’ fires

Figure 14.3

An  ‘A’  bonfire  is  built  by  placing  three  logs  of  firewood  either  horizontally  or 
vertically as shown in the figure and then by piling up pieces of firewood on them. 

Reflector fire

Figure 14.4 - Reflector fire

For free distribution

To build a reflector fire, two poles are held in vertical position and logs of firewood 
are  tied  to  the  poles  as  shown  in  the  figure.  Then,  three  logs  are  placed  on  the 
ground with the two poles forming a rectangular shape. The bonfire is built by piling 
firewood  inside  the  rectangular  shape. This  bonfire  can  also  be  built  by  placing 
granite or some other shiny stones around it so that heat and light is reflected.   
Reflector bonfires can be used to keep the food hot and also to keep the campsite 
hot.

Rectangular fire

Figure 14.5 - Rectangular fire

Rectangular bonfire is built by placing pieces of firewood inside a structure that is 
made by placing logs in a rectangular shape as shown in the figure.  

Pyramid fire

For free distribution

Figure 14.6 - Pyramid fire

To build the pyramid fire, a few pieces of firewood are placed on the ground parallel 
to one another and then another tier is made on them by placing pieces of firewood 
across them. In this manner several tiers of firewood are placed one on top of the 
other changing directions. Use shorter pieces of firewood to make upper tiers, so 
that a pyramid shape is created.

Figure 14.9 - Bonfire displays

On most occasions lighting the bonfire is done in the form of a display. They are 
called bonfire displays.

Bonfire displays are seen mostly during scout camps and during outdoor activities 
and outdoor camps. When making the bonfire, particular attention should be paid 
towards  ensuring  that  a  small  bonfire  is  made  and  that  there  is  sufficient  space 
around the fire for participants to enjoy presenting their songs and dances without 
any disturbance. Bonfire displays should be held maintaining proper discipline and 
safety under the care of a responsible person. Also, a leader should be appointed to 
handle the bonfire display. Arrangements should be made to finish a bonfire display 
within a period of one hour or one and a half hours and it is sufficient to allocate a 
maximum of five minutes for each item. The display should end with the singing 
of national anthem.

Summary

Fire is used today for cooking and for various other purposes. In outdoor activities 
bonfires are used for various activities.

When  making  a  bonfire,  there  are  several  factors  that  should  be  taken  into 
consideration so that the safety of the person making the fire as well as that of the 
others is ensured.

Bonfires  are  named  as  ‘A’  fire,  reflector  fire,  rectangular  fire,  and  pyramid  fire 
based on the way pieces of firewood are piled up for building the fire.

Having a bonfire in the form of a display is called a bonfire display. Bonfire displays 
are useful for enjoyment and to develop creativity of the participants and achieve 
many other objectives.

Bonfire display should be organized, maintaining proper discipline and safety.

Let us cook food outdoors

Although the ancient man was used to eat raw food, it changed with time and at 
present man consumes food that is prepared using different methods. The kitchen 
of a house has a wide variety of utensils that are used to prepare food, but preparing 
food is a difficult task while engaging in some outdoor activity or going on a trip. 

In  previous  lessons,  you  learnt  how  to  do  knots  and  lashings  during  outdoor 
activities and also to make bonfires. 

This lesson will tell you how to cook food outdoors using available resources during 
outdoor activities or during camping.

Cooking food outdoors

Cooking food at home is an easy task because there are varieties of containers and 
bowls  to  keep  food  in  and  there  are  electric  cookers,  gas  cookers  or  permanent 
fireplaces to cook food with firewood. However, these facilities are not available 
when cooking food outdoors during an outdoor camp or during an outdoor activity. 

We engage in outdoor activity with thorough preparation. Therefore we could be 
prepared in advance for this activity by¦

 getting food and beverages supplied to suffice the number of participants for 
       the number of days the camp is held.

 identifying the types of food that can be cooked easily and that can be preserved 
       for a longer time under natural environmental conditions.

 providing with safe vessels that do not break easily for cooking food and for 
        keeping water.

    preparing condiments such as spices and chillies required for cooking packed 
       in small containers.

    selecting a suitable location to cook food within the campsite.

    providing with a small gas cooker if necessary.

However, when lost in a forest or during outdoor activities such as forest explorations 
or  forest  crafts,  it  is  difficult  to  fulfill  tasks  such  as  getting  food  supplies  and 
cooking food without utensils. On such occasions, various kinds of yams, leaves, 
fruit, vegetables or fish that are available in the environment have to be boiled or 
roasted and eaten as food. For that a fireplace has to be made using the available 
resource.  

 Activity

Use various kinds of materials available to you and try making different 
types of fireplaces that can be used to cook food outdoors. 

Types of fireplaces that are used to cook food outdoors

When we speak of cooking outdoors, the three-stone fireplace that you prepared for 
playing cooking rice must have come to your mind. When cooking food outdoors, 
fireplaces  of  several  types  can  be  prepared  using  the  materials  available  in  the 
environment. They include,

•  Carter’s fireplace / three-stone fireplace
•  Ditch fire
•  Stone-row fireplace
• Unit fireplace
• Double-fork fireplace
• Flat-rock fireplace
• Tin can stove

Carter’s fireplace or three-stone fireplace

Carter’s fireplace or the three-stone fireplace can be used to cook food even for a 
large group and any kind of food can be cooked using it. What is special about this 
type of fireplace is that it can be made easily within a short period of time using any 
kind of stone such as granite, bricks, cabook blocks or cement blocks so that any 
type of cooking pot available at the time can be placed on them.   

Ditch fire

Figure 15.2 - Ditch fire

Ditch fire is prepared by digging a ditch in a flat land so that cooking pots can be 
placed on it. The width of the ditch should be decided according to the diameter of 
the cooking pot. A special advantage of this pot is that several cooking pots can be 
placed on this at the same time. 

Unit fire

Figure 15.3 - Unit fire

143

For free distribution

The  unit  fire  is  made  by  standing  a  pole  with  a  strong  fork  on  the  ground  and 
placing another pole across the fork so that the cooking pot can be hanged on that 
pole. A fire is made below the pot. This can also be used to roast certain types of 
food. This cannot be used to cook food for a large group. Newly cut, fresh poles 
should be used for this. 

Double-fork fire

Figure 15.4 - Double-fork fire

Double-fork fire is made by standing two poles of similar length with strong forks 
on flat land and placing another pole on the two forks. Cooking pots are hung on 
the pole and a fire is made below the pots. Double fork fire, too, cannot be used to 
cook food for a large group. Newly cut, fresh poles should be used for this.  

Flat-rock fire

Figure 15.5 - Flat-fock fire

A flat-rock fire can be made by placing a fairly large, flat rock on a few stones. This 
can be used to bake food items like rotee. Instead of the flat rock, a metal plate can 
also be used over the fire to bake food.

Tin can stove

Figure 15.6 - Tin can stove

A tin can stove can be made by removing the lid of a tin and cutting out a square 
shape  from  the  lid  side  as  shown  in  the  figure  so  that  firewood  can  be  inserted 
through the cutting. This can be used for tasks such as baking rotee. 

There are several factors that should be taken into consideration 
before lighting fires for cooking food. They include the following.

 Direction of the wind – When cooking close to buildings or in forest areas, fire 
     should be lighted from the direction that is opposite to the direction of the wind 
     as flames can be blown away by the wind and cause fires.

 Materials like pebbles, turfs and dried matter such as dried leaves available at 
     fireplace should be removed.

 Activity

Join  your  friends  and  go  to  an  open  place.  Find  a  discarded  tin  or  a 
similar object for making a fire and prepare tea as an outdoor activity. 

At present there are many food items in the market that can be prepared easily within 
a short period of time. Although packeted, canned or bottled food available in the 
market which can be prepared easily, learning to cook food with or without using 
utensils is important during camp life. Immense pleasure can be gained by making 
various kinds of cooking utensils from the material available in the environment 
and cooking food items obtained from the environment under minimum facilities 
without using conventional utensils.

Baking rotee

Make a dough by mixing flour and coconut and adding water and salt as required. 
Now make smaller balls of dough. Take a stick such as a tamarind or lime stick, 
which is not harmful, peel it off and clean it well. Now, take the small doughs and 
wind them like rings around the stick. Use a unit fire and bake the rotee by rotating 
the stick over the fire. Different types of yams and meat, too, can be cooked in the 
same manner. Apart from this method, the dough can be flattened to make a rotee 
of the traditional form and it can be baked on a flat-rock fire.

Summary

Various kinds of utensils and fireplaces are used in the kitchen of a home to cook 
food, but during an outdoor activity, while camping or while in the forest, cooking 
food is not an easy task. 

In such situations, food has to be cooked with or without the use of cooking vessels 
using various types of fires that are made with the available resources. 

There are several types of fires that can be used to cook food outdoors. They include 
the  carter’s  fireplace  or  the  three-stone  fireplace,  ditch  fire,  stone-row  fire,  unit 
fireplace, double-fork fireplace, flat-rock fireplace and the tin can stove. 

These  types  of  fire  places  can  be  used  to  bake  rotee,  boil  or  roast  meat,  fish  or

16 Let us train high jump events

According to the classification of athletic events, high jump can be described as 
a vertical jump that comes under field events. In high jump events, jumpers can 
display  maximum  skills  by  maintaining  the  different  factors  of  physical  fitness 
such as strength, flexibility and coordination at highest levels and by adopting the 
correct technique.

In  lesson  9,  you  learnt  the  technique  of  long  jump  and  also  engaged  in  practice 
activities to practise the technique.

In this lesson you get the opportunity to learn the Fosbury Flop technique of high 
jump by engaging in activities related to high jump. 

Techniques of high jump

Five techniques of high jump can be identified based on how the body of the jumper 
moves when clearing the cross bar in high jump.

1. Scissor jump
2. Eastern cut-off
3. Western roll
4. Straddle
5. Fosbury flop

Out  of  these  techniques,  Fosbury  flop  technique  is  the  most  used  by  jumpers  at 
present in order to display maximum performance.

Phases of high jump technique

1. Approach run
2. Take-off
3. Bar clearance
4. Landing

Fosbury flop technique of high jump

High jump is done according to Fosbury flop technique under the four phases 
mentioned above. 

• The jumper uses the initial stage of the approach run to gain speed. 

• At the second stage the jumper controls his speed and gets ready to take off.  

• When the jumper is making the approach run along a curved path, the jumper’s 
   body is inclined towards the curve of the path. 

• At the last step of the approach run, the body is inclined to the back. 

• When taking off, the take off leg should be well-straightened and the foot should 
    touch the ground well while the free leg is bent at the knee and is raised to 
   become parallel to the ground. 

• The back of the jumper is turned towards the cross bar and the cross bar is cleared 
   with the body arched. 

• After clearing the bar, the bust, which is now parallel to the ground, falls on the 
   landing area first with the shoulders and then with the hands.  

Figure 16.1 - Fosbury flop technique

NB: When doing high jump with the Fosbury flop technique, it is very  dangerous 

 to practise or jump without using a proper mattress.

Go to the playground with your friends and engage in exercises that 
would help boost the strength of the legs.

Some of the rules related to high jump

1. After three consecutive failiures, the jumper is removed from the competition.
2. Take-off should be taken from one foot.
3. If  the  crossbar  falls  off  the  supports  due  to  some  action  of  the  jumper  while 

jumping, it is considered to be a failure.  

4. If the jumper touches with any part of the body the area outside the two posts or 
    the landing area before clearing the bar, it is considered as a failure.

Summary

According to the classification of athletic events, high jump is a vertical jump.

There are five techniques of high jump; however, Fosbury flop technique is the
most popular technique at present.

High jump can be described under four phases, namely approach run, take-off, 
clearing the bar and landing.

Skills related to high jump can be improved through various activities. Gaining 
knowledge about the rules of high jump and following them help to make successful

Let us practise throwing
 events

Throws come under field events according to the classification of athletic events. 
Putting  the  shot,  throwing  the  discus,  throwing  the  javelin,  and  throwing  the 
hammer belong to throwing events. Only putting the shot, throwing the discus and 
throwing the javelin are included in school level athletics events. The weight of the 
throwing equipment differs according to the age group of the participants. Putting 
the shot and throwing the discus are done from within a circle by adopting rotatory 
movements. Throwing the javelin is done with an approach run in a specially laid 
down area. When a piece of equipment is thrown with the rotating movements of 
the body or with an approach run, it can be thrown farther than when it is thrown 
while standing in one position. 

When you were in Grade 8, you learnt how to hold the throwing equipment, namely 
the shot, the discus and the javelin and engaged in activities to practise throwing such 
equipment. You also practised throwing these equipment from standing position.     

In this lesson, you will learn how to put the shot and throw the discus and javelin 
from the power position.  

Power position

The events of putting the shot, throwing the discus and the javelin are described 
under several phases.  

These phases are preparation and starting position, speed building position, power 
position, release and follow through. 

The  phase  of  power  position  is  common  to  all  these  three  events.  In  throwing 
events, the phase immediately before releasing the throwing equipment is called 
the power position.  

When an equipment is released from the power position, that piece of equipment 
gains  more  momentum  and  a  greater  speed.  Therefore,  by  practising  the  power 
position, the thrower gets the ability to throw the equipment to a farther distance.

Summary

According  to  the  classification  of  athletic  events,  the  events  of  shot  put,  discus 
throw and javelin throw come under field events. 

The  throwing  techniques  of  these  throwing  events  are  described  under  several 
phases. 

Out of these phases, the phase immediately before releasing the equipment is the 
power position.

The shot, the discus and the javelin gain greater momentum and power when such 
pieces of equipment are thrown from power position.

Gaining knowledge about rules related to throwing events is important for making 
successful attempts in throwing competitions.

You  can  gain  experience  in  throwing  these  equipment  by  engaging  in  practice  
activities.

Exercise

1. Name four throwing events.
2. State separately the throwing events in which the equipment is thrown from 
    within a circle and those thrown after an approach run.
3. What are the phases that are common to both the shot put technique and the 
    discus throw technique? 
4. What is the phase that comes immediately before the phase of releasing the 
    throwing equipment and is common to all throwing events?

Let us develop social values
 through sports

People  prefer  to  live  in  a  group  rather  than  in  isolation.  Such  a  group  is  called 
a  community.  The  family  is  the  smallest    social  unit. A  person  is  accepted  as  a 
member of a community, when its rules and customs are observed. In life there are 
many opportunities to comply with social norms. In this context the school plays 
an important role. Pursuing studies and taking part in extra-curricular activities in 
the school helps you to be an active member of the school. Participating in inter 
house  sports  and  other  team  events  provides  valuable  experience  in  becoming  a 
socially accepted person. Sports takes a major role in building up of social values 
in the society. 

In previous grades you learnt that it is essential to abide by the rules, regulations 
and ethics of sports in order to maintain the honour of the sport as well as fair play 
and safety of the players.

Let  us  learn  in  this  lesson  the  social  value  of  observing  rules  and  regulations  in 
sports.

Rules, regulations and ethics in sports

To give an opportunity for every student to take part in sports, the following levels 
of competition are available.

• Minor games and lead-up games
• Inter house sports competitions
• Friendly matches amongst classes
• Inter school friendly matches
• Divisional sports competitions
• Provincial sports competitions
• All island sports competitions
• Sports competitions at international level

You may have participated in at least two or three of the events given above. You 
would  have  gained  valuable  experience  by  observing  the  rules  of  the  game  and 
rules of good conduct.

Indicate the qualities you would need to be a useful member of the team 
representing your house, for instance 4x100m relay.  

The rules of sports are accepted principles to be followed in the game.
eg: The dimensions of the play area, number of players in each team, specifications 
        of equipment. 

Regulations of the sports are terms and conditions within the frame of rules.   
eg: outfits specified for each sport.

The traditions, sportsmanship and good conduct are known as the ethics of sports. 
eg: At the end of the game both teams shake hands with each other as well as with  
      the umpires / referees.

Taking part in a sport whilst abiding by its rules and regulations is true sportsmanship. 
It is also respecting social values.

Figure 18.1 - Face criticism

Even if a person achieves the highest standards in a sport, but does not follow the 
rules, regulations and ethics it leads to disadvantages, given below¦

• Liable to be sent out of the game
• To be debarred from the sport
• Face disgrace
• Face criticism

An  outstanding  cyclist  Lance Amstrong  of  the  USA  and  Marion  Johnes  a  sprint
champion of the USA were found guilty of taking performance enhancing drugs 
and were deprived of the gold medals they won at the world cycling championships 
and the Olypmic sprint respectively. As a result they lost the respect of the sporting 
world and were condemned by all.

  The social value of observing the rules and ethics of sport

It is expected that a person will change for the better by participating in sports. Such 
a change can be personal or among individuals or in a group. The benefits of such 
a change are given below.

•  Productive way of spending leisure time
• Mental and physical development
• Training to work together in a group
• To work in cooperation with others
• Engage in daily activities with contentment
• Ability to spend time pleasantly in any group or society
• Become valuable members of society who are courteous and respect good
   behavior

You must make every effort to obtain the benefits given above by taking part in 
sports.

A person who observes the rules of the sports will be respected in any society.

Therefore it is clear that by following rules, regulations and ethics of good conduct 
in a sport is considered valuable in any society.

Taking part in sports in school would give you valuable experience in addition to 
the knowledge you get in the classroom. This experience is most useful when you 
take up higher studies after school or in later employment.

Some of the good qualities you gain by participating sports are.
• Being active
• Be sociable
•  Organizational abilities
• Decision making abilities
• Problem solving abilities
• Good interpersonal relationships
• Emotional control abilities

  As a sportsman how do you maintain good relationships? 

When  taking  part  in  sports  it  will  be  necessary  to  work  with  different  types  of 
people. Sometimes the members of the team may not be united and do not cooperate 
which gives rise to problems. 

You  may  have  seen  in  the  television,  incidents  where  sportspersons  argue  with 
members of the opposing teams, referees or umpires and spectators attacking the 
players with items such as bottles and stones. It is necessary to take steps to avoid 
such  conflicts.  Therefore  in  dealing  with  team  mates,  opposing  teams,  umpires, 
referees and spectators there are several qualities that need to be developed.

Qualities required in dealing with team members

A team includes its members and coaches. In team sports success depends on the 
skills of team members, their dedication and team spirit.

In sports, the team that plays against you is not an enemy but only a competitor.

Figure 18.4 - Be cordial with opposing team

In your relationships with opposing teams the following qualities are required¦

• Appreciate and congratulate any outstanding skill of the opposing team
• Point out courteously any breakage of rules by the opposing team
• Avoid arrogance in the event of victory and refrain from giving excuses for defeat

•  Avoid ridiculing and making unsuitable remarks

Qualities needed in dealing with referees / umpires

Referees or umpires involve to hold the game according to the rules and regulations 
and to decide on the victory or defeat in a game. 

The following qualities are required when dealing with umpires.

• Respect the judgment
• Do not directly question the umpire on his decision
• If the decision is questionable, objection should be made according to the rules
• A mistake on the part of the umpire must not be criticized
• Avoid exchange of harsh words with the umpire
• Avoid arguing with the umpire
• At the end of the competition, leave from them with courtesy

Qualities  needed  in  maintaining  good  relationships  with  the

•  Ignore spectators jokes
• Appreciate good responses from spectators
• Maintain cordial relationships with the spectators
• Do not keep room for fights with the spectators
• Do not accept illegal favours from spectators

Expected qualities of spectators at sports events

Persons watching a sports competition must behave in a manner that safeguards 
the honour of both the sport and the sportsmen. You may have seen incidents in 
international matches, spectators behave in a provocative manner as reported in the 
media. Spectators must realize that unlawful acts would result in punishment from 
the relevant authorities. 

Hence spectators must observe  certain norms of behavior.

• Encourage teams in both victory and defeat
• Avoid criticizing, humiliating or annoying the teams
• Encourage and evaluate  the performance of the teams whether you support or not
• Harsh or inappropriate words must be avoided
• Avoid making excessive noise which can be a hindrance to the game
• Avoid taking liquor, drugs or smoking in the field

If  you  have  the  characteristics  mentioned  above  then  you  have  acquired  true
sportsmanship and developed social qualities.

A  person  who  has  followed  rules  and  regulations  of  sports  and  rules  of  good
conduct will be recognized in the society as a respectable law abiding citizen.

Let us improve our psychosocial 
fitness

We have to face many challenges in life. These include personal challenges such 
as illness, exams, unemployment as well as natural disasters and war which affect 
the entire society. We need good physical, mental and social fitness to overcome 
such challenges. Mental and social fitness is important for proper decision making, 
facing challenges and to make use of one's experience in a positive way. 

In  the  previous  grades  we  learnt  about  factors  which  improve  psychosocial 
wellbeing such as emotional balance, empathy, effective communication and good 
interpersonal relationships. 

In this lesson we will learn some more skills which will improve our mental and 
social fitness.

Creative and exploratory thinking 

We  may  have  to  make  quick  decisions  when  faced  with  challenges.  Creative 
thinking and exploratory thinking are necessary to meet such challenges.

Creative  and  exploratory  thinking  ability  is  ability  to  use  our  knowledge  and 
creativity to generate options which are novel.

Reading different types of books, thinking logically about what is learnt, engaging 
in games such as chess or draughts which require analytical thinking can develop 
our thinking abilities.

Nalindu visited Nipun at home after school. Both agreed to go for a walk along the 
paddy fields. Nalindu picked up a bamboo almost unintentionally. They noticed that 
there was a heavy current in the stream near the paddy field.

Nipun: We can cross here because the stream is not very deep.  
Nalindu: Yes, but we don’t know how deep it is. 

Nalindu immersed the bamboo in the stream and checked its depth. “It is about three 
feet deep, we can even get washed away by the current. Let us walk down and find 
a narrow part of the stream to cross” He said.

They walked down and found a narrow part of the stream. Nalindu used the bamboo 
to jump across. He then extended the bamboo and helped Nipun too to cross the 
stream. 

Afterwards Nalindu walked in front and used the bamboo to part the grass. They 
once saw a snake slithering across the grass.

They walked to the end of the stream. They found a mango tree full of fruits. It was 
too tall to climb or pluck the fruits. Nalindu aimed and threw the bamboo at a branch 
with fruits. Four or five mangoes fell. They picked them up and both enjoyed eating 
the magoes.

The final use of the bamboo was when the next door dog Tommy jumped at them. 
Tommy  was  a  fierce  dog  who  had  also  bitten  some  people.  Nalindu  waved  the 
bamboo at the dog to keep it away. The aunt next door then came and tied up the 
dog.

Nipun: “This is a magic bamboo. Can I have it please?”
Nalindu:  “There  is  nothing  magical  about  this  bamboo. We  used  it  appropriately 
when it was needed”. 

The above example shows how the two children were able to avert several dangers 
by using the bamboo appropriately.

“It is all right we have studied and we can continue to do so even if you are not there 
Amma. We can also get help from our grandmother” Ruwangi suggested.

“What about the school trip?” their mother asked.

“ I don’t think you will have enough money for it now. Also there is no one to drop 
me and pick me up. So I will go on the trip next time”. Ruwangi added thoughtfully. 

“I will look after my younger sister, we can wash our own clothes” Nirodha said.

Let's see how did the people in this story use the strategies described below.

175

Ways of handling problems

1. Be positive that the problem can be solved.

2. Understand the nature of the problem. - Collecting information about the problem 
    is helpful for this.

3. Be creative and generate alternatives to solve the problem. - Writing these down 
    may be helpful.

4. Select the most appropriate solution and implement it. - You need to be aware 
   of who can help you and the resources available when selecting the most 
   appropriate solution.

5. If you cannot think of a suitable solution you can get the advice from an adult 
    who you can trust.

6. If the problem has an impact on the whole family or a group where everyone is 
    affected, must meet and discuss options - You must respect each others opinions. 
     Sometimes sacrifices may have to be made to achieve a solution that is acceptable 
    to all.

7. If one solution does not work, find out reasons for failure and select and implement 
    another solution.

Once you solve a problem, you can use that experience to solve similar problems 
in the future. Some  people use  maladaptive behaviours  such as  using  alcohol or 
getting into conflicts which complicate problems. You need skills to solve problems 
while maintaining your physical and mental wellbeing and without getting stressed.

Acting with responsibility

The class teacher has not come to school as she was not well. The students were 
shouting  and  behaving  in  an  unruly  manner.  Malindu  was  the  monitor.  Malindu 
tried to stop the students from shouting but they did not listen to him. He knew if 
this behaviour went on longer they would all be punished by the teacher in the next 
class. 

Malindu had a bright idea. “Can everyone please sit down. We are going to have 
a competition. This is a general knowledge competition. Can Nilmini and Oditha 
become the leaders? We will divide the class into two groups. Each group can ask 
questions from the other. The side that answers the most questions correctly is the 
winner”.  

“Excellent” said the students. Everyone sat down and the competition commenced. 
The  competition  was  proceeding.  The  students  were  busy  thinking  of  difficult 
questions. 

The principal on his walk around the school came into the class room. He was very 
pleased to see that the class was quiet despite the absence of the teacher. He praised 
all the students. 

The above case shows that we sometimes need to make decisions regarding others. 
We must act with responsibility in such situations.

Because Malindu made the correct decision, as the class monitor, everyone benefited. 
He had the power to make the decision. If he has avoided responsibility everyone 
in the class would have suffered. When people with power avoid responsibility it 
can harm the society.

Coping effectively with stress 

We become stressed when we have to face challenges. Stress is the physical and 
psychological reaction to a challenge. 

Being late to school, becoming ill, facing exams, losing a friend or death of a family 
member cause different degrees of stress. 

Some  extent  of  stress  lead  us  to  do  our  work  effectively  and  to  face  challenges 
successfully.

There are only a few days more for the term test. Everyone is talking about it. 

Madhavan saw that Nizam was looking unhappy and was resting his head on the 
desk. “Nizam, do you have a headache?” asked Madhavan.

“No I slept only a few hours last night. I studied throughout the night. I get scared 
when  I  see  the  number  of  books  I  have  to  study.  Then  I  don’t  feel  like  doing 
anything”.  “Last  few  days  I  studied  without  watching  television  or  going  out  to 
play. But I can’t remember anything” Nizam said.

“Why did you take such a long time to finish studying?  I do daily work and finish 
all the tasks given by the teacher. By doing that my knowledge improved. About one 
month before the exam I made a timetable and started revising. I continue to read 
story books and plan to take part in the badminton tournament tomorrow as well” 
Madhavan said.

Saman who was listening to this story said “ Why do you want to work so hard? I 
couldn’t do any work. Now there is no point in studying. Therefore I don’t want to 
start studying now. I don’t mind even if I am the last in the class”. 

Madhvan replied “Your position in class is not important. The purpose of a term test 
is to check if you have understood what has been taught”. “Nizam, there is no point

in  studying  throughout  the  night.  Proper  sleep  is  important  for  a  good  memory. 
Make  a  time  table  today  and  study  whatever  you  can  within  the  next  few  days. 
Don’t forget to have some time to rest and play” Madhavan advised Nizam. 

“When I have lot of work to do I don’t feel like studying at all. What should I do 
when that happens?” asked Nizam.

“Why  don’t  you  listen  to  a  song  or  talk  to  someone  so  that  you  become  less 
stressed? After that you can get back to studies.  Study a subject you like when that 
happens. In the morning when you are active you can study the difficult subjects” 
said Madhavan.

You can see that in the above story Nizam became very stressed because he couldn’t 
complete revising on time. Because he was stressed he couldn’t even do the work 
he otherwise could have done. When the stress reaches a certain level it reduces 
efficiency and leads to failure.

If a student has no stress at all he will become lazy and would not prepare for the 
exam. Saman is an example of such a student. Therefore a certain amount of stress 
helps us meet challenges. 

Madhavan who sees the exam as a challenge, and wants to get good results started 
studying well in time. His advice to Nizam on how to face stress is very useful. 
Working according to a timetable, making optimal use of time and working to a 
plan helps achieve success. Proper rest helps reduce stress. Engaging in sports and 
adequate sleep also help decrease stress and improve your memory.

7. Engaging in religious activities
8. Engaging in activities which calm the mind such as meditating

The good habits listed above are connected with each other and improve mental and 
social wellbeing. Developing one such skill will lead to improvement in other areas 
as well. You can achieve success by developing these skills.

Summary

Developing  of  skills  which  improve  mental  or  social  wellbeing  help  us  face 
challenges successfully.

Creative  and  exploratory  thinking  involves  being  able  to  observe  a  situation, 
identifying  factors  which  influence  it,  using  our  knowledge  and  creativity  to 
generate novel alternative solutions, selecting and implementing the most suitable 
course of action.

The ability to solve problems helps us achieve success as individuals and as groups. 
When we discuss solutions as a group we should ensure that everyone contributes, 
solutions are arrived at through dialog and each others views are respected. 

Taking responsibility and making correct decisions helps society.

Stress is the physical and psychological reaction to a challenge. Excessive stress 
can  lead  to  failure.  Being  prepared  in  advance,  being  organized  and  good  time 
management can help minimize stress.

Let us identify gender 
responsibilities

All  animals  produce  offspring  which  ensures  the  survival  of  the  species.  The 
male and the female reproductive systems are made up to produce offspring. The 
reproductive system becomes active during adolescence and produces secondary 
sexual characteristics. You and your friends who are about 14 years old will begin 
to  display  these  characteristics.  It  is  important  to  learn  facts  about  reproductive 
health and not to believe in inaccurate information. 

In  Grades  7  and  8  you  learnt  about  the  functioning  of  the  male  and  the  female 
reproductive systems. We also learnt how the menstrual cycle prepares the female 
reproductive system for a pregnancy and the role of the male reproductive systems 
in conceiving a child. 

In this lesson we will learn about sexuality, healthy sexual behaviours and social 
norms.

Gender

The child is assigned a gender based on the appearance of the external genitalia. The 
biological gender is determined genetically and through the action of hormones. 

Society assigns different gender roles for males and females. For example society 
assigns different dress codes for males and females and expect girls and boys to 
play  with  different  toys.  Social  norms  regarding  responsibility,  behaviours  and 
roles  contribute  to  the  social  concept  of  gender. The  social  concept  of  gender  is 
also influenced by economic status, culture, religion and political influences. Our 
gender role as a male or a female is acquired by imitating our parents, the clothes 
we dress during childhood, toys we play with etc.

      Senali came back from school to find her father cooking. “Your mother went to 
    see your grandmother who is not well. I will do the household work today” Senali’s 
    father said.

   Senali helped her father with the cooking and washing up. They both washed the 
    clothes. After some time her brother returned home from school. He swept the 
    floor and, folded the clothes.

   Their mother came home in the evening. She looked tired. Senali’s father made her a    
    cup of tea. “Although I wasn’t at home the work has been done well” she said smiling.

From ancient times, in Sri Lankan households, cooking, housework and looking 
after children have been the responsibility of the female. The husband goes to work 
and is responsible for earning for the family.

However,  many  social  changes  have  happened  in  the  recent  past  and  often  both 
husband and wife go out to work. Therefore, the difference in the assigned gender 
roles have become less. Depending on the time available, both husband and wife  
equally the share the responsibilities and work.

As shown in the incident above, sharing of work equally ensures a successful family 
life. If work is not labeled as “work of women” and “work of men” and it is shared, 
it will improve everyone’s wellbeing. You should also do the same while at home 
and in school.

Explain how the family members in the above incident  helped each 
other without adhering to male, female or age related stereotypes. 

The socially attributed male and female roles can lead to conflict and stress.

Socially assigned differences in gender can lead to issues such as abuse of women 
and children, women being restricted to the home, depriving children of education, 
male female inequality in certain occupations and abuse of human rights.

Therefore, the international concept of human rights does not recognize the social 
concept of gender. It states that both males and females are entitled to the same 
rights as humans. There should not be any gender discrimination at home, work 
place or society.

Responsibilities and behaviours related to sexuality and 
reproduction

Male and female gender roles are determined by two major factors. The biological 
sex  which  is  genetically  determined  and  the  socially  assigned  gender  which  is 
determined  by  social  and  cultural  factors.  Based  on  these,  from  childhood,  we 
identify  ourselves  as  male  or  female  and  behave  accordingly.  Gender  identity  is 
one’s personal experience of one’s own gender. 

People express their sexuality in different ways. Reproduction is the main function 
linked with sexuality. It is important to adopt healthy, responsible sexual behaviours. 

The  conception,  implantation  and  development  of  the  foetus  takes  place  in  the 
female  reproductive  system.  The  male  reproductive  system  contributes  to  the 
conception of the child. After the birth of the child the female assumes the mother’s 
role and the male assumes the father’s role.

Until 20 years of age, the female reproductive system is not adequately developed to 
provide the nutrition necessary for the foetus. The adolescent female reproductive 
system  is  still  undergoing  growth.  Both  adolescent  boys  and  girls  are  not 
psychologically mature enough to assume the role of a mother or father. They are 
still developing skills needed to function in the role of a mother or father.

The minimum age at marriage in Sri Lanka is 18 years. The law has been enacted to 
prevent teenage pregnancies which can harm the mother and the baby.

The  sexual  relationship  between  two  married  adults,  based  on  love  and  trust, 
contributes  to  physical,  psychological  and  social  wellbeing.  A  child  born  to  a 
married couple, who plan the pregnancy, will enjoy more love and security than if 
it is born to an unmarried mother.

Most  married  couples  are  economically  stable. Therefore,  they  are  more  able  to 
provide the child’s educational and other needs. The child will develop psychological 
and social skills by associating the parents, family and friends.

A child born to unmarried parents will often have the protection of only one parent. 
Sometimes the child may not get the love and protection of either parent. There may 
not be adequate economic resources to provide for the needs of the child. The child 
will not get adequate psychological and social support. If there is inadequate love 
and security such children may engage in antisocial behaviours.  If married parents 
too do not carry out their responsibilities and provide adequate, love, and security, 
their children’s education may get disrupted and they may consume alcohol and 
other drugs  or be subjected to sexual abuse.

Responsibilities of parents for a healthy child

The ideal family will help each other, share joys and sorrows and work together. 
This will build up a good relationship between parents and their children who will 
become citizens who contribute positively to the society.

The birth of a child is a special occasion for the parents. The parents have a special 
responsibility to ensure the birth of a healthy child. They must be prepared for the 
birth of the child. Planning for the pregnancy will contribute to the health of both 
mother and child.

What a mother should do to ensure the birth of a healthy child

1. Eat a healthy, balanced diet.

2. Inform the public health midwife about the pregnancy. She will then educate the 
    mother and direct her to obtain the necessary services.

3. Attend clinics conducted by the Medical Officer of Health (MOH) in the area, 
    take the supplementary nutrition, vitamin and minerals as prescribed. Undergo

Summary

The biological gender of a person is determined genetically. 

The social concept of gender assigns different roles and responsibilities for males 
and females based on cultural, religious and political factors.  

The  gender  based  stereotypes  assigned  by  the  social  concept  of  gender  can 
sometimes be harmful.

A happy family disregards strict adherence to gender roles.

Gender identity is one’s personal experience of one's own gender, which is based 
on the biological sex and the social concept of gender. 

Responsible  sexual  behaviour  is  essential  for  physical  and  mental  health.  Good 
relationship  between  parents  and  responsibility  towards  each  other  ensures  a 
healthy environment for the children.

Let us overcome social
 challenges

There  are  many  social  challenges  which  affect  our  wellbeing.  To  face  them 
successfully we need to identify them and steps to overcome them. This will help 
improve our physical, psychological and social wellbeing. 
In the previous grades we learnt about environmental challenges such as accidents, 
disasters, abuse and diseases and how to overcome them.

This lesson will focus further on how to face social challenges.

Major social challenges
• Unhealthy eating habits 
• Diseases
• Climate change and disasters
• Cultural factors
• Problems related to new technologies
• Conflicts

Let us discuss how to overcome each of these challenges.

Unhealthy eating habits

We fulfil our nutritional requirements by consuming food which we buy. We can 
classify these foods into 2 categories.

1. Natural foods
2. Artificial foods

Artificial foods

Natural foods are those which
have been minimally processed
and have no added preservatives,
flavours or colours. 

eg: fresh vegetables, fruits, 
      cereal.

Foods which have been subjected
to changes

   eg: processed food
      junk food
         fast food

Natural food
Natural food has high nutritional value and is free of harmful chemicals. Therefore, 
natural food is healthy. Although some foods have not been processed they may 
have been contaminated by pesticides and chemical fertilizers. Therefore, we have 
to select natural foods carefully. 

We must select the following types of food  
• Food which has been grown without using pesticides or chemical fertilizers
• Food with a thick outer covering
• Fresh food
• Foods which are in season

Artificial food

1. Processed food

Processed  foods  are  foods  where  the  content  has  been  changed  physically  or 
chemically to preserve it or to enable quick preparation. Preservatives or artificial 
flavours are added to processed food. 

eg: canned vegetables and fruits. 

Milk which has been pasteurized and par-boiled rice are not harmful to health.  

2. Fast food

Fast food can be prepared and consumed within a short time. Fast foods have less 
nutritional value. 

eg: instant noodles, bacon, food made with wheat flour. 

3. Junk food

Junk food contains excessive sugar, fat and calories. They have less fiber, protein, 
vitamins and minerals. 
eg: potato chips, fried manioc chips, chocolate, fizzy drinks, rolls, pizza.

Diseases

We can classify diseases as;

1. Communicable diseases
2. Non-communicable diseases

Communicable
diseases
These diseases can spread from 
one person to another. They 
are caused by disease causing 
microbes. They can spread 
directly or through a vector. 

eg:  dengue, malaria, filaria,
       tuberculosis, leptospirosis,
       typhoid, diarrhea, sexually 
       transmitted diseases.

Non-communicable
diseases

These  are  caused  by  physical 
factors and do not spread from 
one person to another. 

eg: diabetes, cancer, hypertension 
       and mental illness.

Dengue

Dengue is spread by 2 species of Aedes mosquitoes. Dengue has become a major 
health challenge because of the actions of humans. 

Dengue  fever  can  result  in  complications  such  as  dengue  haemorrhagic  fever. 
Because such conditions can be fatal we must prevent the illness and diagnose early 
with the help of investigations and treat adequately. 

Symptoms of dengue

Fever which lasts more than 2 days

Headache

Eye pain

Muscle and joint pain

Nausea and vomiting

Red spots which develop on the skin

Bleeding

What should we do when 
these symptoms are present?

• Do not engage in strenuous 
   activities. You must rest

• Use only paracetamol to control 
    the fever

• Drink recommended amounts of  
    fluid

• Do not consume food and drinks 
   which are red or brown coloured

• Seek medical advice and carry out

Tuberculosis

Cough is a common symptom. Cough which lasts more than 2 weeks should be 
investigated. The bacteria which causes tuberculosis can be identified by examining 
the  sputum  which  is  coughed  out.  Tuberculosis  can  be  cured  by  treating  for  6 
months.

Leptospirosis

The infective agent is transmitted through the urine of infected rats. The bacteria 
enters the body through open wounds and by drinking or bathing in contaminated 
water where the bacteria can enter through the mucosa in the mouth or eyes. 
In addition to rats, pets can also transmit these bacteria.

Farmers in areas where this disease is present should contact the MOH office and 
obtain preventive medicines. Open wounds should not be exposed to contaminated 
water. Medical advice should be sought immediately in case of noticing following 
symptoms.

Sexually transmitted disease. 

Sexually  transmitted  diseases  are  spread  from  one  infected  person  to  another 
through unsafe sexual behaviour. 

eg: HIV AIDS, gonorrhoea, syphilis, genital warts and genital herpes.

HIV AIDS 
Infection  with  the  HIV  (human  immunodeficiency  virus)  can  result  in  AIDS 
(acquired  immune  deficiency  syndrome) This  suppresses  the  immunity  provided 
by the white blood cells in blood and reduces our resistance against infection. 

The symptoms of AIDS appear after many years, therefore, the person can transmit 
this disease to others during this period. The HIV cannot survive on its own in the 
environment, it can only survive inside a live cell.

HIV can be diagnosed by a blood test.

Mental illness

Mental illness can be precipitated by stress due to difficulties in decision making, 
problem solving and poor life skills. 

Like physical illness, mental illness can also pose a risk to life. Some mental illness 
may be difficult to diagnose during its early stages. 

The risk of mental illness is increased by the competitive life style which affects our 
wellbeing, poor stress management and lack of leisure activities.

communicable diseases? 

Climate change and disasters

In recent times, there is more frequent change in weather patterns and environmental 
disasters.  Disasters may occur naturally or due to acts of man such as environmental 
pollution.

Earthquakes, Tsunami, floods, landslides, cyclones, lightning strikes etc are some 
examples for disasters. 

Because  disasters  cause  major  disruption  to  life  it  is  important  to  identify  such 
situations early and take appropriate action.

Harm caused by climate change and disasters

• Spread of diseases
• Loss of life
• Damage to property
• Displacement
• Injury
• Shock
• Mental stress

Cultural influences

Sri Lanka is a multicultural country made up of Sinhalese, Tamils, Moors, Burghers 
and  other  races.  Many  countries  in  the  world  too  are  multicultural.  There  are 
differences in aspirations, religion, language, beliefs, traditions, clothes and other 
factors among different people. This can sometimes lead to social problems. 
eg:
• Social isolation and difficulty in meeting ones needs because of inability to speak    
   a language.
• Racial discrimination.
• Discrimination in opportunities for education and employment.

Learning to respect other cultures, just like our own, and treating everyone equally 
and humanely can prevent such problems.
Sometimes when people of different cultures live together certain cultural values 
may clash. It is important to be aware of such situations and be flexible.
We must develop skills such as ability to respect others, effective communication, 
developing good interpersonal relationships and controlling our emotions. This will 
allow people of different cultures to live together without creating problems. 

 Activity

Think of some people you know who belong to different cultural
backgrounds. List the similarities and differences among them.

Improper use of technology

New technology has enabled us to carry out our daily activities easily and efficiently. 
However improper use of technology has negative consequences.

For example, the internet and social media have many uses but improper use can 
result in harmful consequences for children and adults.

Negative consequences of technological development 
• Use of machinery instead of human labour has led to unemployment
• Manufacture of dangerous chemicals and nuclear weapons
• Reduced interpersonal relationships and social isolation
• Lack of life skills development due to excessive use of machinery
• Sedentary life style and as a result risk of contacting non-communicable diseases
• Children who cannot set limits on the use of mobile phones and social media may 
    be led astray and be exploited

You  must  learn  to  earn  the  benefits  of  technological  development  and  minimise 
their negative consequences.

Examples of positive use of technological development
1. Communication can be carried out quickly and easily
2. Ability to obtain information and knowledge anytime, anywhere
3. Makes household work easier
4. Reduces stress by providing entertainment
5. Provides educational opportunities
6. Improves the quality of medicines and other treatment methods
7. Saves time and money
8. Supports inventions and creativeness

Conflict

Conflicts arise due to mismatch or disagreement of ideas or preferences. Conflicts 
can arise within us or within society.

Conflict

 • Within us
 • Between parents and children
 • Between friends
 • Between employers and 
     employees

Sometimes  conflicts  can  arise  within  us  when  we  have  to  make  choices.  For 
example when choosing subjects we have to consider factors such as what we like 
and dislike as well as what is easy and difficult etc.

When we associate with the people who have different ideas and preferences we 
may face situations where there are disagreements which can lead to conflict.

Negative consequences of conflict

Ways to prevent conflicts

• Mental illness
• Disruption of education
• Loss of employment
• Financial problems
• Due to physical conflicts

-injury
-disability
-loss of life 

 Activity

• Develop life skills
• Follow a simple life style
• Develop psychological and 
   spiritual wellbeing
• Maintain good interpersonal 
   relationships
• Develop healthy attitudes

Discuss with your friends about situations where you resolved conflicts.

Summary

Processed  foods,  diseases,  negative  consequences  of  new  technologies,  climate 
change  and  disasters,  conflict  and  cultural  influences  are  some  examples  of 
challenges we face in society. 

Natural foods are high in nutritional value while artificial food can cause health 
problems.

Communicable  diseases  are  spread  through  air,  water,  food,  animals  and  sexual 
behaviour. Most non communicable diseases are caused by unhealthy life style.

Harms caused by climate change and disasters include spread of disease, damage to 
life and property, displacement, shock, stress and disruption of education.

We  must  ensure  that  conflicts  don’t  arise  when  people  of  different  cultural 
backgrounds live together. 

Although  new  technologies  are  helpful  they  can  have  negative  consequences. 
Therefore,  we must use them carefully.

Conflicts arise when there is disagreement.  These conflicts can arise within us or 
with other members of the society. We can avoid conflict by developing life skills.   

Exercise

1. Name the social challenges which affect health.
2. Explain how junk food and fast food affect our health.
3. List communicable diseases and state how they are transmitted.
4. Describe how we can prevent non communicable diseases.
5. What are the harmful consequences of climate change and disasters?
6. How can we minimise dangers in disaster situations?
7. What skills should you develop to prevent cultural clashes and conflicts?
8. What are the negative consequences of improper use of new technologies?

Foreword

The  Educational  Publications  Department  which  is  entrusted  with  the  responsibility  of 
providing a free textbook to the students by the government fulfills the duty diligently in 
each year for the student community which exceeds 04 million. 

Without  limiting  to  the  above  mentioned  important  task,  the  Educational  Publications 
Department  is  engaged  in  producing  supplementary  reading  materials  for  Advanced 
Level and other higher examinations. As a result of that process, valuable books with the 
contribution of subject experts in different fields are sold at a concessionary price. 

These  supplementary  reading  materials  can  be  an  excellent  source  of  knowledge  for 
those  who  sit  for  examinations  and  for  the  reading  public  who  is  interested  in  reading 
different academic books. I would like to compliment the subject experts and the staff of the 
Educational Publications Department who contributed to produce this book. 

like  to  extend  my  thanks  to  you  who 

justify  the  following  saying 
I  would

CAPTURE OF COASTAL AREAS OF SRI 
LANKA BY THE DUTCH

Introduction

The Kandyan kings realized that a considerable naval power was required in order to 
free the country from the Portuguese who had established their power in the coastal 
areas of Sri Lanka. Therefore, King Rajasinghe II sought the support of the Dutch to 
drive the Portuguese from the country. However, after driving the Portuguese, the 
Dutch broke the agreement that had been entered into with the King and went on to 
establish their power in many of the areas that had previously been captured by the 
Portuguese. Consequently, by year 1658, there had established a Dutch rule in the 
coastal areas of Sri Lanka. Thereafter, the Dutch ruled those areas until 1796. This 
chapter discusses the establishment of Dutch rule in the coastal areas of Sri Lanka, 
nature of the relationships that the Dutch maintained with the Kandyan kingdom 
and  the  salient  features  of  the  political,  economic  and  cultural  affairs  during  the 

Dutch rule in Sri Lanka.

1.1 Capture of Coastal Areas of Sri Lanka by the Dutch

Arrival of the Dutch in Asia 

In the 16th century, the Dutch were engaged in the trade of buying at the 
Lisbon Harbour in Portugal the spices and other commodities that were brought 
by the Portuguese from Asia and selling them in European countries. Holland, the 
motherland  of  the  Dutch,  was  at  that  time  a  colony  of  Spain.  The  Spanish  were 
Roman  Catholics  and  the  Dutch  were  Protestants;  hence,  there  existed  religious 
controversies between these two nations. The Dutch, therefore, began to rebel against 
the Spanish for winning independence.   Meanwhile, Prince Phillip II, who became 
the King of Spain, also inherited the kingship of Portugal and got the opportunity 
to work against the Dutch. Consequently, King Phillip II prohibited the Dutch to 
arrive at Lisbon Harbour. Since the Dutch ships could not enter the Lisbon Harbour, 
in  order  for  the  Dutch  to  get  the  spices  and  other  commodities  they  needed  for 
their trade, they had no alternative other than reaching Asia where spices and such 
commodities were produced.

The Portuguese had taken steps to prevent the knowledge about the sea routes to 

Asia from being passed to other European nations until a century had passed since 

their arrival in Asia. During that period they did not allow a single Dutch, English 

or  French  national,  except  for  those  whom  they  completely  trusted,  to  come  to 

Asia on their ships. The Dutch, however, succeeded in discovering the sea route to 

Asia by about year 1595 by employing spies in various ways and by other means. 

Thus several Dutch Trade Companies had arrived in Asia by year 1602; however, 

a  competition  was  created  among  Dutch  companies  themselves  in  buying  the 

commodities produced in Asia. Further, none of those Dutch companies had been 

given  any  legal  authority  to  act  in  Asia  on  behalf  of  Holland.  Having  taken  this 

situation into consideration, the Dutch ruler went on to amalgamate several Dutch 

trade  companies  and  formed  the  Dutch  East  India  Trade  Company  or  the  VOC 

Company in 1602. According to the royal mandate of this company, it was granted 

powers  to  engage  in  trade  activities  in  Asia  on  behalf  of  the  Dutch  government, 

to conquer areas, to build fortresses, to appoint governors and to rule the relevant 

areas.         

  After year 1602, the VOC Company grew financially stable and hence, the Dutch 

were able to send very powerful fleets of ships to Asia. The Dutch who arrived in 

Asia  in  this  manner  under  the  VOC  Company,  established  their  headquarters  in 

Batavia in Java Island and established their power in the islands in East Asia and in 

several locations in the coastal areas of India. In building their trade power in the 

Indian Ocean, the Dutch inevitably had to fight against the Portuguese. 

Kandyan Kings seeking support of the Dutch

  Not long after the arrival 

of  the  Dutch  in  Asia,  in 

1602,  the  Dutch  Admiral 

named Joris Van Spilbergen 

reached the eastern coast of 

Sri  Lanka  with  three  ships 

and  landed  at  Batticaloa. 

He  then  went  to  Kandy 

area  where  he  met  King 

Wimaladharmasuriya  I  in 

July, 1602. By that time, King 

Wimaladharmasuriya  had 

been  highly  disappointed

The Portuguese had taken steps to prevent the knowledge about the sea routes to 
Asia from being passed to other European nations until a century had passed since 
their arrival in Asia. During that period they did not allow a single Dutch, English 
or  French  national,  except  for  those  whom  they  completely  trusted,  to  come  to 
Asia on their ships. The Dutch, however, succeeded in discovering the sea route to 
Asia by about year 1595 by employing spies in various ways and by other means. 
Thus several Dutch Trade Companies had arrived in Asia by year 1602; however, 
a  competition  was  created  among  Dutch  companies  themselves  in  buying  the 
commodities produced in Asia. Further, none of those Dutch companies had been 
given  any  legal  authority  to  act  in  Asia  on  behalf  of  Holland.  Having  taken  this 
situation into consideration, the Dutch ruler went on to amalgamate several Dutch 
trade  companies  and  formed  the  Dutch  East  India  Trade  Company  or  the  VOC 
Company in 1602. According to the royal mandate of this company, it was granted 
powers  to  engage  in  trade  activities  in  Asia  on  behalf  of  the  Dutch  government, 
to conquer areas, to build fortresses, to appoint governors and to rule the relevant 
areas.         

  After year 1602, the VOC Company grew financially stable and hence, the Dutch 
were able to send very powerful fleets of ships to Asia. The Dutch who arrived in 
Asia  in  this  manner  under  the  VOC  Company,  established  their  headquarters  in 
Batavia in Java Island and established their power in the islands in East Asia and in 
several locations in the coastal areas of India. In building their trade power in the 
Indian Ocean, the Dutch inevitably had to fight against the Portuguese. 

Kandyan Kings seeking support of the Dutch

  Not long after the arrival 
of  the  Dutch  in  Asia,  in 
1602,  the  Dutch  Admiral 
named Joris Van Spilbergen 
reached the eastern coast of 
Sri  Lanka  with  three  ships 
and  landed  at  Batticaloa. 
He  then  went  to  Kandy 
area  where  he  met  King 
Wimaladharmasuriya  I  in 
July, 1602. By that time, King 
Wimaladharmasuriya  had 
been  highly  disappointed 

Figure 1.2 – Admiral Spilbergen meets King Wimaladharmasuriya I

4

with the activities of the Portuguese. Therefore, the King agreed to get the assistance 
of the Dutch to drive the Portuguese from the country.  

About  three  months  after  Spilbergen  had  left,  a  delegation  led  by  a  Dutch 
captain named Seebald de Weert met King Wimaladharmasuriya I. When the 
king got to know that this new emissary, too, was of the same nationality as 
Spilbergen, the king welcomed him enthusiastically and even had discussions
with him about the manner as to how the two parties should act in order to 
drive the Portuguese from the country. However, at a later occasion, Seebald 
de Weert spoke to the king in a disrespectful manner which led to a dispute 
between  Seebald  and  the  king’s  men.  This  dispute  ended  resulting  in  the 
unfortunate death of Seebald de Weert. Finally, the king had to give up his 
hopes of getting the support of the Dutch to drive away the Portuguese.

After King Wimaladharmasuriya I, his brother Senarath became king. During 
his  reign,  King  Senarath  had  discussions  with  two  Dutch  delegations,  but 
those discussions did not yield the results the king had expected.

The Treaty between King Rajasinghe II and the Dutch

After the reign of King Senarath had ended, his son ascended the throne as 
King Rajasinghe II. He was strongly determined to drive the Portuguese from 
this country. Therefore he took action to get the support of the Dutch who had 
a strong naval power. Accordingly, he had discussions with the representatives 
from the Eastern Headquarters of the Dutch in Batavia. The king agreed to 
give to the Dutch the proprietorship of the Cinnamon trade in Sri Lanka and 
also a harbour in the eastern coast of Sri Lanka in return for the support they 
would give him to drive the Portuguese. The objective of the king in doing so 
was not at all to bring another European nation in place of the one already 
present in the country. Consequent to the discussions that took place between 
the king and the Dutch, the king’s army, together with the Dutch, surrounded 
the Portuguese fortress in Batticaloa. After launching several attacks on the 
Portuguese, the troops succeeded in driving the Portuguese from the fortress. 
Delighted  with  this  victory,  King  Rajasinghe  II  entered  into  an  agreement 
with the Dutch in the month of May in 1638.     

5

The Key Points of the 1638 Treaty:

  The Dutch agreeing to support the king of Kandy to drive the Portuguese from   

the country.

  The king agreeing to settle by way of providing the Dutch with commodities  
such as cinnamon, pepper and beeswax for the amount that the Dutch would  
spend on battles against  the Portuguese.

  Granting the Dutch the monopoly of collecting commodities from the    
  Kandyan areas except for elephants. 

  Agreeing to deploy, if the King wished to do so, the Dutch army at the    

fortresses that would be captured from the Portuguese.

Battles for driving the Portuguese and Establishment of Dutch Power in the 
Coastal Areas    

   After  the  treaty  had  been  signed  in  1638,  it  took  twenty  more  years  to  drive 
the Portuguese from this country. During that period, the Dutch and the Kandyan 
army  went  on  capturing  the  Portuguese  fortresses  in  Trincomalee,  Negombo, 
Galle,  Kalutara,  Colombo,  Mannar  and  Jaffna  and  other  fortresses  that  were 
under  Portuguese  power.  After  the  fortresses  in  Trincomalee  and  Negombo  had 
been  captured,  there  arose  controversies  between  the  King  and  the  Dutch.  Such 
controversies  erupted  because  the  Dutch,  after  capturing  the  fortresses  in  areas 
which  were  more  advantageous  for  them,  did  not  take  steps  to  hand  over  those 
fortresses to the king, which was a violation of the agreement.  

It is evident that, from the very beginning, the Dutch had been very crafty when 
dealing with the king. In terms of one clause of the 1638 Treaty, “Dutch army may 
be deployed in fortresses captured from the Portuguese only if the King of Kandy 
wished to do so”, but the Dutch acted forgetting that clause. Accordingly, the Dutch, 
without  consulting  the  king,  deployed  their  army  at  the  fortresses  they  captured 
from the Portuguese. As cinnamon grew in abundance in Negombo and Galle areas, 
the Dutch did not hand over those areas to the king, but kept those areas under 
their control. Because of this controversy, the king refused to pay the salaries of the 
workers employed at those fortresses saying that it was not his responsibility. The 
Dutch said in response that they could not hand over the fortresses until the king 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6

paid the amount they demanded in order to cover up their expenses on the battles 
they had fought. The controversy that erupted between these two parties gradually 
intensified in this manner. However, King Rajasinghe II seems to have dealt with 
this matter with great patience as he needed further support of the Dutch to capture 
from the Portuguese the other fortresses including the Colombo Fort.    

Figure 1.3 – Galle Fort

Meanwhile, a huge Dutch army arrived in Sri Lanka headed by a General named 
Gerard  Hulft.  Becoming  more  powerful  with  their  arrival,  the  Dutch  army  then 
positioned  artillery  on  high  grounds  and  surrounded  Colombo  Fort  in  order  to 
capture  it  from  the  Portuguese.  Pleased  with  the  work  of  General  Hulft,  King 
Rajasinghe  showed  him  great  respect  and  sent  a  huge  army  to  join  them.  With 
this move, the Portuguese became utterly helpless and surrendered to the Dutch 
handing over to them the keys to the fort.    

The Dutch who had so far been carrying out their operations from Galle fort made 
Colombo  fort  their  headquarters  and  further  strengthened  it.  This  was  another 
instance where the Dutch broke the agreement that had been entered into in 1638. 
This intensely annoyed King Rajasinghe. In 1658 the Dutch captured Mannar and 
then Jaffna Fort putting an end to Portuguese rule in the coastal areas of Sri Lanka. 
However,  the  Dutch  retained  with  them  the  fortresses  they  had  captured  from 
the Portuguese. After the king had realized that the aim of the Dutch had been to 
establish their own power in the areas which had been under Portuguese rule, the 
King implemented a strategy in order to minimize the areas that the Dutch could 
capture. Accordingly, the king took steps to attach to the Kandyan Kingdom many 
areas that had been under Portuguese rule and would now be acquired by the Dutch. 
Because of the king’s strategy, the extent of the areas that the Dutch could acquire 

7

was smaller than the extent of the areas that had been captured by the Portuguese. 
However, since a similar European nation was brought to the country in place of 
the Portuguese, there created the Sinhala proverb “Inguru dee miris gaththa wage” 
which means an act “like exchanging ginger for chilli”. 

Relationships of the Dutch with the Kandyan Kingdom

   Out of the three European nations, namely the Portuguese, the Dutch and the 
English, it was the Dutch who maintained healthy relationships with the Kandyan 
Kingdom for the longest period. The policy that the Portuguese adopted towards 
the Kandyan Kingdom was aggressive. The English captured the Kandyan Kingdom 
even  before  a  period  of  two  decades  had  passed  since  they  had  established  their 
power in the coastal areas, but the Dutch maintained peaceful relationships with 
the Kandyan Kingdom from 1658 to 1796 by way of missions and exchanging of 
communications etc.; however, whenever they got the opportunity, they even did 
not hesitate to invade the Kandyan Kingdom either. For this reason, there seems 
to be some diversity in the relationships that existed between the Dutch and the 
Kandyan kings.      

Relationships between King Rajasinghe II and the Dutch

   As  described  above,  King  Rajasinghe  II  brought  in  the  Dutch  to  drive  the 
Portuguese from the country, but during the period from 1638 to 1658, the areas 
that the Dutch captured from the Portuguese were not handed over to the king as 
agreed leading to controversies between the two parties. The Dutch officials who 
implemented the Dutch polices in this country during the period from 1658 to 1675 
did not have any understanding of the power of the Kandyan Kingdom. Therefore, 
with the intention of surrounding the 
Kandyan  Kingdom  on  land  and  by 
sea, the Dutch captured several areas 
in  the  Eastern  and  Western  coasts 
which  had  been  under  the  Kandyan 
Kingdom.  King  Rajasinghe  II,  who 
had been silent about such invasions 
by  the  Dutch,  began  to  attack  the 
Dutch  on  all  sides  after  year  1670. 
The fact that the Dutch lost almost all 
the areas that they had captured after 
year  1658  shows  how  powerful  and 
how  immediate  the  attacks  that  the 

Figure 1.4 – Jaffna fort

8

Kandyan armies launched under the guidance of King Rajasinghe II had been. It 
seems that the  series of  attacks  launched  by  King  Rajasinghe’s armies  helped the 
Dutch to gain a proper understanding of the war power of the Kandyan Kingdom 
and also to formulate their future policy towards the Kandyan Kingdom. After these 
attacks, the Dutch realized that the Kandyan armies were capable of fighting against 
them face to face on land, and that, if they tried to capture the Kandyan Kingdom, 
they  would  have  to  engage  in  an  unending  war  with  the  Kandyan  Kingdom  as 
the Portuguese had done. As a result, the Dutch took steps to deal with the 
Kandyan  Kings  showing  them  respect  and  fear,  and  to  maintain  peaceful 
relationships with the Kandyan Kingdom as far as possible.

Kandyan – Dutch Diplomatic Relationships 

   There existed diplomatic relationships between the Kandyan Kingdom and the 
Dutch  from  the  time  of  King  Wimaladharmasuriya  I.  During  the  reign  of  King 
Rajasinghe II, at least eight Dutch emissaries had met him from time to time. Out 
of  the  Dutch  diplomatic  representations  that  were  made  during  King  Rajasinghe 
II, General Gerard Hulft’s meeting with King Rajasinghe II in 1656 was the most 
significant.  By  this  time,  the  Portuguese  had  not  been  driven  from  the  country 
and there also existed controversies between the king and the Dutch. The Dutch 
emissary who went to Kandy on invitation of the king was welcomed by the king 
with great respect. It has been stated in the records of the Dutch that the General 
was escorted to the king in a colourful procession. The king, too, was very pleased 
with the civilities and respect Hulft had extended to him.

 After the reign of King Rajasinghe II had ended, such diplomatic representations 
were made during the reigns of King Wimaladharmasuriya II, King Weeraparakrama 
Narendrasinghe, and King Sri Wijayarajasinghe, too. During this period, diplomatic 
representations were organized on occasions where controversies arose between the 
king and the Dutch and when relationships between the two parties deteriorated 
due to reasons such as closure of gravets. On most occasions, communications from 
governors were handed over to the kings during such representations. Apart from 
that,  representatives  of  the  king,  too,  visited  the  low  country  and  met  the  Dutch 
leaders.

During  diplomatic  representations,  the  two  parties  exchanged  gifts  and  showed 
cordiality, and listening to requests made by each other; discussing the issues that 
affected the two parties were given prominence. 

9

As  the  Dutch  governor  and  the  king 
rarely met each other, such diplomatic 
exchange  of 
and 
representations 
communications  were  very  important 
in bringing the views of the two parties 
together. When King Rajasinghe II sent 
written communications to the Dutch, 
he referred to himself as the “Emperor 
of  Sri  Lanka”.  The  Dutch  in  return 
stated  “Three  Sinhaladheeshwara”,  at 
least  nominally,  when  referring  to  the 
king  in  their  communications.  When 
the king wrote letters to the Dutch, he 
referred  to  them  with  phrases  such  as 
“Dear Dutchmen at my service” and the 
Dutch  closed  the  letters  they  wrote  to 
the  king  with  phrases  such  as  “Your 
obedient  servant”.  The  following  table 
gives  some 
information 
important 
about the meetings that several Dutch 
emissaries had with the king:

Peace policy and avoiding Conflicts 

   After  King  Rajasinghe  II  in  1687,  his  son  ascended  the  throne  as  King 
Wimaladharmasuriya II. King Wimaladharmasuriya II protected the kingdom that 
was inherited from his father and also maintained friendly relationships with the 
Dutch. Some of the measures taken by the two parties are as follows:

		Providing Dutch ships to bring Upasampada Bhikkus (Bhikkus of higher  

ordination) from Burma

  Lifting the ban that had been imposed on the Dutch to peel cinnamon in  

Pitigal Korale

  Dutch Company agreeing to buy the king’s cinnamon, areca nut, and  

elephants  

After King Wimaladharmasuriya II, his son Sri Weeraparakrama Narendrasinghe 
became king. He had been famous as ‘Prince of Kundasaale’. During this period, 
there  occurred  several  incidents  that  led  to  gradual  deterioration  of  the  peaceful 
relationships  that  had  been  maintained  with  the  Dutch.  The  king  took  steps  to 
engage in more trade by sending areca nut, elephants and ivory to India through 
Kalpitiya and Puttalam harbours. The Dutch, who considered this to be a great loss 
for them, closed all the harbours and disrupted the trade activities of the Kandyan 
kingdom. In response, the king, too, banned transportation of elephants through 
his areas, and prevented the people in Kandyan areas from selling cinnamon and 
other spices, and food produced in those areas to the Dutch.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
11

 By  this  time,  people  who  lived  in  areas  under  Dutch  rule  seem  to  have  been 
disappointed  with  the  activities  of  the  Dutch.  The  disappointment  of  the  people 
had been aggravated by the excessive taxation, overcharging of the people by tax 
collectors,  and  by  the  intolerable  situation  that  the  cinnamon  peelers  were  faced 
with. This resulted in eruption of riots in several areas that were under Dutch rule. 
The Dutch quelled those riots using their powers. 

 Sri  Weeraparakrama  Narendrasinghe,  too,  followed  the  tradition  of  the  previous 
kings and brought a South Indian princess of Nayakkar Dynasty and made her the 
chief queen. Consequently, many members of the Nayakkar Dynasty came to this 
country and they settled in Kandyan areas having received various high positions in 
the government. Moreover, their power in the king’s palace was increasing, too.     

 In 1739, King Weeraparakrama Narendrasinghe died and as he did not have any 
sons, one of the brothers of Nayakkar queen ascended the throne as King Sri Vijaya 
Rajasinghe. This marks the end of the royal lineage of King Wimaladharmasuriya I. 

Invasion of the Kandyan Kingdom by the Dutch

 After King Sri Vijaya Rajasinghe, his Nayakkar Queen’s brother ascended the throne 
as  Keerthi  Sri  Rajasinghe.  He  implemented  various  measures  to  uplift  Buddha 
Sasana which had deteriorated by that time. Ven. Welivita Saranankara Thero gave 
the necessary advice for the king to implement those measures. The king obtained 
ships from the Dutch and sent a delegation to Siam in order to bring Upasampada to 
this country. A group of Buddhist monks headed by Ven. Upali Thero was brought 
here and Upasampada was established in Lanka in 1753. This marks the beginning 
of the present Siam Sector.

12

There  seems  to  have  occurred  conflicts  between  the  Kandyan  Kingdom  and  the 
Dutch once  again  by  about  year 1762.  Now  the  king  wanted  to  seek  the  support 
of  some  other  nation  to  fight  against  the  Dutch.  As  a  result,  in  1762,  an  English 
emissary named John Pybus arrived in Kandy. This visit caused fear in the Dutch 
who then invaded the Kandyan Kingdom sending six brigades along six different 
routes under the guidance of Governor Baron Van Eck. However, the Kandyans did 
not allow a single brigade to reach at least close to the City of Kandy. The Kandyans 
launched attacks on the Dutch using their familiar fighting strategies and the Dutch, 
having lost all their hopes with the defeat they suffered, retreated to the low country. 
Before long after this defeat, the Dutch once again invaded the Kandyan Kingdom 
in 1765. In this invasion both parties suffered heavy losses. When the Dutch entered 
the City of Kandy in February 1765, the king ran away to Hanguranketha for safety. 
The king did not agree to the conditions proposed by the Dutch who captured the 
City  of  Kandy.  However,  the  Dutch  became  fed  up  with  the  diseases  that  spread 
after the beginning of the rainy reason and also with the attacks launched by the 
Kandyans, and finally returned to the low country. 

 As these conflicts continued for several years, the king was now looking forward to 
establish peace in the country.

 On  the  other  hand,  the  conduct  of  the  Nayakkar  kings  caused  disappointment 
among the Kandyan aristocracy and the Buddhist monks. The king, having come 
to know of this situation, sent emissaries to the Dutch to negotiate peace. Taking 
advantage of this situation, the then Dutch Governor Willem Falck put forward a 
number of conditions that are more advantageous for the Dutch. The king had to 
agree to those conditions and the treaty that consisted of 25 clauses was signed in 
1766. Some of the clauses of this treaty are as follows:   

Some Clauses of the 1766 Treaty

	Jaffna, Mannar, Kalpitiya, Colombo, Galle Korale, and Trincomalee and  

the surrounding areas belong to the Dutch.

	A distance of a Sinhalese gawwa into the land from the coast belongs to  

the Dutch. 

According  to  this  treaty,  the  Kandyan  Kingdom  became  like  an  island  within  an 
island.  Soon  after  the  treaty  had  been  signed,  the  king  began  to  realize  the  evil 

 
 
13

effects it had caused. Then the king requested the Dutch to return the coastal areas 
to him, but the Dutch did not agree. Instead, the Dutch established their power in 
the coastal areas and also took measures to develop the agriculture and cinnamon 
cultivation in those areas. 

 After the signing of the treaty in 1766, the controversies that existed between the 
Kandyan  King  and  the  Dutch  began  aggravate.  The  Dutch  violated  some  of  the 
conditions in the agreement and banned the supply of salt to areas that were under 
the rule of the king. This caused great difficulties to people in the Kandyan Kingdom. 

 After  King  Keerthi  Sri  Rajasinghe,  his  brother  ascended  the  throne  as  King 
Rajadhirajasinghe in 1782. The Dutch rule came to an end with the arrival of the 
English who reached Lanka in 1796 and defeated the Dutch capturing the areas that 
were under Dutch rule.

1.2 Administrative, Economic, Social and Cultural Affairs during the Dutch Rule

Organization of the Dutch Administration

Since the Dutch was organized as a trade compAny, the Board of Directors of the 
VOC Company in Holland was the highest authority who made decisions regarding 
the  areas  under  Dutch  rule  in  Asia.  As  Holland  was  very  far  away  from  Asia,  in 
1609, VOC Company appointed a separate governor for Batavia in order to rule the 
areas under Dutch control in Asia. Further, an Advisory Council was appointed to 
assist the Governor in Batavia.   

After  the  Dutch  power  had  been  established  in  the  coastal  areas  of  Sri  Lanka, 
a  separate  governor  was  appointed  by  the  Trade  Company  to  look  into  the 
administrative affairs of this country. Apart from that, a special council consisting of 
Dutch officers in Sri Lanka was also appointed to assist the governor. Although the 
Dutch governor in Sri Lanka and the assisting council were under the authorities in 
Batavia, the governor, according to his capabilities and personality, could seek advice 
directly from the Board of Directors in Holland. As travelling between Sri Lanka, 
Batavia and Holland took a long time at that time, and because of the difficulties 
there existed in maintaining communication, the Governor in this country had the 
opportunity of making indepenent decisions, particularly regarding urgent matters.  

The Dutch governor and his advisory council in this country had powers to rule 

14

the areas under Dutch control. Accordingly, they could handle the administrative 
matters  in  the  relevant  areas,  collect  taxes,  appoint  officers  and  grant  lands.  The 
governor acted on the decisions of the advisory council. 

 The areas under the rule of the Dutch in this country were divided into three main 
parts which were called commanderies. 

Colombo Commandery   

 This was administered under the Dutch governor. Coastal areas including Colombo, 
Kalutara,  and  Negombo,  and  the  inland  areas  such  as  Hanwella,  Anguruwathota 
and Malwana where there were citadels came under Colombo Commandery.

Galle Commandery

A  separate  commodore  had  been  appointed  to  look  into  the  affairs  of  the  Galle 
Commandery. The coastal areas from Bentara River up to Batticaloa and the inland 
areas belonging to those parts came under Galle Commandery. 

Jaffna Commandery

 Jaffna Commandery, too, was administered under a separate commodore. The areas 
in the coastal belt from Puttalam North to Jaffna, the areas in Jaffna, and the areas 
up to Batticaloa in the eastern coast which were under Dutch rule came under Jaffna 
Commandery.  

 Although it had been an accepted practice that the two commodores in Galle and 
Jaffna  Commanderies  should  act  under  the  governor  in  Colombo,  they  had  the 
opportunity to act independently when practically fulfilling their tasks.

 The administration below the governor and the commodores was divided into three 
parts namely, civil administration, military administration and trade division. For 
civil administration, there was a Dissavani under each commandery. A Dissavani 
was divided into Korales and Korales were divided into Paththus. There were Mudalis 
and Vidanes in charge of various services offered by Disavani. The responsibility of 
handling all the matters in the Dissavani was vested with the Dissawe.Organizing 
of  the  Dutch  armies  was  done  under  the  captains  of  the  armies.  For  the  trade 
division  there  were  Opper  Hueman  (senior  trader)  and  under  him  was  Hueman 
(person in-charge of land revenue). Accordingly, the following chart shows how the 
administration was organized under Dutch rule: 

Administrative  structures  similar  to  the  one  that  was  in  effect  in  Colombo 

Commandery under the Dutch governor were in effect in the other commanderies, 

too, under commodores. When organizing the civil administration under the Dutch, 

the Dissave was vested with significant powers. There were three Dissaves for the 

three Commanderies. Dutchmen were appointed as Dissaves while native people 

were appointed for the positions in the lower levels of the administrative structure.

Judicial Affairs

 The Roman Dutch law which is a part of the law that is currently in effect in Sri 
Lanka was inherited from the Dutch. The Dutch revised the Roman Dutch law to 
suit the local laws and customs that existed in Sri Lanka and then implemented it 
in the country. The Dutch made use of the juridical institutes that existed in the 
country and also introduced a new judicial system. The new judicial system is as 
follows: 

Raad Van Justitie (High Court)

 This was the highest court in the Dutch judicial system. The head of this court was 
called Huft Administar. The main function of this court was to hear criminal cases. 
These high courts had been established in all the three commanderies. 

Civiele Raad (Civil Court)

 Civiele Raads or Civil Courts had been established in Colombo, Galle and Jaffna 
Commanderies from the very beginning of the Dutch rule. Civil cases relating to 
damages below 120 Rix-dollars and cases relating to marriage were heard at these 
courts.

Land Raad - Land Court 

Land Raads or Land Courts had been established in the centres of Colombo, Galle, 
Jaffna, Trincomalee, Batticaloa, and Matara. Dissave was the Chairperson of these 
courts. Some consider this court system to be a simple, less expensive and easy to 
use system for the local people.

Fiscal Courts / Dissave Courts / Headman Courts

These courts functioned as courts at the lowest level of the Dutch judiciary. The local 
officers such as village headman, Vidane, Mudali, and Korala who were officers of 
the lower levels of the administrative structure had a little judicial power relevant to 
their positions. The traditional rules and laws that existed among people in Jaffna 
area were formulated as laws and were then implemented. 

Economic Activities of the Dutch

 The  Dutch  implemented  their  economic  policy  in  a  way  that  they  could  gain 

17

maximum economic benefits from the areas that were under their rule in Sri Lanka. 
They knew that the quality of the cinnamon that was produced in Sri Lanka was 
very  much  higher  than  that  produced  in  the  other  Asian  countries  under  Dutch 
rule. Therefore, the Dutch were particularly interested in promoting the cinnamon 
cultivation and processing and trading cinnamon. At the initial period, the Dutch 
got the cinnamon that naturally grew in the woods peeled by the local people in 
the area, but later they cultivated cinnamon in areas such as Colombo, Kalutara, 
Aluthgama and Matara. Mahabadde Department, which existed from the time of 
the  Portuguese  to  handle  affairs  relating  to  collection  and  trading  of  cinnamon, 
was brought under a separate captain by the Dutch and it was made function more 
efficiently. The traditional labour roster method was used to peel cinnamon. The 
Dutch made a register of the names of cinnamon peelers and took steps to get the 
maximum service of those peelers. Annually, an adult peeler had to peel a particular 
amount of cinnamon to the Company free of charge. In this way, the Dutch earned 
huge profits by trading cinnamon.  

 Apart from cinnamon, the Dutch also earned profits from the trade of items such 
as areca nut, pearl, ivory, pepper, nutmeg, cardamom, elephants and beeswax. In 
addition to that, the taxes they charged from lands were also important to them. 
The Portuguese had prepared a type of registers called Thombu which contained 
details of ownership of lands and the taxes to be collected from those lands. The 
Dutch  further  regularized  those  registers  and  prepared  three  types  of  Thombu 
namely, family, land and school Thombus. A family Thombu contained details of 
the families that lived in a village. A land Thombu contained details of the lands that 
belonged to the families of a village, the types of cultivations available in those lands 
and the taxes to be collected from those lands by the company. In a school Thombu 
names of the parents of children living in a village, the dates of birth of the children, 
dates of leaving school, and if moved to another village, such dates were included.    

Details contained in a Land Thombu of the Dutch

  Dombagahawatta 
to  Don  Bastian  Appuhamy  of 
Rathmalanegama, No. of coconut trees – 195. Tax to be collected – 01 Rix-dollar 
and 24 Stiver.   

land  belonging 

By preparing Thombu, the Dutch were able to get information about the number of 
people living in a village, and details of the lands and cultivations available in those 

18

lands, and thereby, they were able to get details of the taxes that could be collected 
from those lands and the services they could obtain. 

 Further, the Dutch took steps to reduce the amount of money the Company had to 
spend on importing rice and textile from other countries, and also to generate some 
additional income by way of manufacturing in this country the things required for 
local consumption or for trade. Examples for some of the steps they took in that 
regard are given below: 

  Making arrangements to bring Muthurajawela under cultivation.
  Making efforts to increase the production of rice by renovating tanks such as 
   Yodha Wewa and Kantale Wewa.
  Developing cultivations such as sugarcane, pepper, cardamom, coffee, mulberry 

and indigo.  

  Developing industries such as weaving cloth, dyeing cloth, and making bricks

and tiles.

  Constructing canals such as Hamilton Canal in Colombo and using them for 

transportation of goods.

Social and Cultural Activities of the Dutch

Policy on Religion

The  Dutch  were  protestanists.  After  they  had  captured  the  coastal  areas,  they 
implemented various measures to spread their religion in those areas. They brougt 
clergymen from Holland in order to convert people to protestantism. The Dutch 
used education as an effective strategy in promoting their religion. 

Education Activities

The  Dutch  established  a  system  of  institutes  called  schools  for  the  purpose  of 
promoting their religion. One school was established for several villages and it was 
made compulsory for all children in those villages to attend that school. Education 
was provided in the mother tongue of the children. Prayers in protestanism were 
given prominence in the school curriculum. In addition to that, subjects such as 
native language, music, and the scriptures were taught and a formal examination 
system  was  started,  too.  They  appointed  a  team  of  officers  to  supervise  schools.  
Separate  schools  were  established  for  the  children  of  the  Europeans.  Higher 
educaion  was  given  in  the  Dutch  language  at  the  seminary  in  Colombo.  In  this 
way, the Dutch took steps to convert people to protestanism through the education 
provided at schools and also by giving various government positions and titles.

The Dutch brought a printing press to this country for the first time in 1739 and an 
extract from the bible was printed with that machine and was distributed throughout 
the country.   

Social and Cultural Impact of the Dutch Rule

The Dutch ruled the coastal areas of Sri Lanka for about 138 years. The impact that 
was  caused  to  the  society  and  the  culture  of  Sri  Lanka  by  the  Dutch  rule  can  be 
studied in several aspects. They can be briefly analysed as follows:

  Construction of houses with verandahs, upstairs, columns and higher roofs 

following Roman architecture

  Introduction of a number of types of food.  e.g.: cake, pickle, kokis
	Introduction of the judicial system
  Addition of Burghers to the Sri Lankan society

BRITISH POWER IN SRI LANKA

Introduction

The English came to Sri Lanka after the two Western nations, the Portuguese 

and the Dutch. The motherland of the English is England or Britain. The British rule 

in this country commenced in 1796 with the capture of the coastal areas of the country 

that were under the Dutch rule. In 1815, the English captured the Kandyan Kingdom, 

too, and made the entire country a British colony. Thereafter, the English ruled this 

country for 133 years until 1948 and this had an enormous impact on the history of 

this  country.  This  chapter  discusses  how  the  British  seized  the  ruling  power  of  this 

country, the struggles of the native people against the British rule, and the economy of 

this country during the colonial rule. 

 
23

2.1 The Arrival of the British in Sri Lanka and Establishment of Their 

Power in the Country  

Capture of the Coastal Areas by the English

   The Portuguese who came to India in 1498 then came to Sri Lanka in year 1505. 
After the Portuguese, the Dutch came to Asia in early 17th century and came to Sri 
Lanka in the middle of that century (in 1658). Then the Dutch went on to establish 
their power in the coastal areas of this country which were under the rule of the 
Portuguese. The English do not seem to have had any interest in Sri Lanka until 
about one and a half century had passed since their arrival in India. However, by 
the end of the 18th century, the English had begun to show an interest in Sri Lanka. 
There are several reasons as to why the English developed an interest in Sri Lanka. 
They are as follows: 

		   The importance of the location of Sri Lanka
		   The importance of the Trincomalee harbour
		   The importance Sri Lanka had in trade activities

The Importance of the Location of Sri Lanka

You have already learnt that Sri Lanka is a country that is located as an island in the 
Indian Ocean. This location was important to the English for three main reasons – 

  The English who had established their power in the eastern and western coastal 
areas of India by the 18th century found Sri Lanka, which is located as a separate 
island to the south of India, very important in protecting their areas in India from 
other western nations.

  The location of Sri Lanka was important to the English not only in ensuring the 
security of India, but also in maintaining dominance in naval power in the Indian 
Ocean. 

  Sri Lanka is located as a center along the Eastern and the Western trade routes.   

24

Figure 2.1 – How the English had positioned artillery guns in order to protect the 
Trincomalee harbour

Importance of the Trincomalee Harbour

The Trincomalee harbour seems to have been important to the English due to the 
following reasons:

  It is a natural harbour that faces the Bay of Bengal and Southeast Asia. 

  As it is a natural harbour that protrudes into the land, ships could be 
   protected from dangerous cyclones. 

  Trincomalee harbour was strategically important in the naval battles that 

the English were fighting in the Indian Ocean against the French.  

  
  
25

Figure 2.2 - Trincomalee harbour 

Importance in Trade Activities

Sri Lanka was especially important to the English in the trade activities they were 
engaged in across Asia. There were several reasons for that:

  Cinnamon and other spices of very high quality could be obtained from 

Sri Lanka (e.g.: pepper, clove, cardamom, etc.)

  Apart from spices, many other items such as elephants, pearl and gems 
that were very important in their trade were available in Sri Lanka. 
  The English had the opportunity to build a market in Sri Lanka for the 

goods produced by the British. 

Relationships that existed between the English and the Kandyan Kingdom before 
1796

At the time when the British arrived in Asia, the coastal areas of Sri Lanka were under 
the rule of the Dutch and the Kingdom of Kandy existed as a separate, independent 
state. There had erupted controversies between the Dutch and the Kandyan King 
because of the troubles and the threats that the Kandyan Kingdom suffered because 
of the Dutch.  Therefore, the rulers of the Kandyan Kingdom sought the support of 
the English to drive the Dutch from this country. 

  
  
  
26

Figure 2.3 – John Pybus meets King Keerthi Sri Rajasinghe

Consequent  to  this  meeting,  there  occurred  several  diplomatic  representations 
between the Kandyan Kingdom and the English. They include:

  John Pybus visiting King Keerthi Sri Rajasinghe in 1762

  Hugh Boyd visiting King Rajadhirajasinghe in 1782

  Robert Andrews visiting King Rajadhirajasinghe in 1795

At the initial period after the English emissaries had arrived in this country, there 
were  friendly  relationships  between  the  English  and  the  Dutch.  Therefore  the 
English were reluctant to fight against the Dutch. Hence, the objective of the King 
could not be achieved during the first two visits of the English emissaries. However, 
when  Robert  Andrews  met  King  Rajadhirajasinghe  in  1795,  the  English  sought 
the support of the King to capture the Dutch forts. Although the King had made 
arrangements to send his troops to assist the English, they did not need the King’s 
support because capturing the Dutch forts was not as difficult as they had thought 
it to be.   

27

Establishment  of  the  Power  of  the  English  East  India  Company  in  the 
Coastal Areas of this Country

Holland was the motherland of the Dutch who had captured the coastal areas of 
this country before the English did. As a result of the French Revolution, France 
invaded Holland and seized power in Holland; consequently, Prince William V fled 
to Britain. Hence, there established a French rule in Holland and the English feared 
that the coastal areas in Sri Lanka which were under the Dutch rule would also be 
captured by the French. Taking advantage of this situation, the English got Prince 
William to sign a letter granting to the English the coastal areas of Sri Lanka that 
were under the Dutch rule. As this letter was written at the Kew Palace in England, 
it came to be called the Kew letter.  

 When the Kew letter was handed over to the then Dutch Governor Van Angelbeek, 
he did not agree to act accordingly. In response to the Governor’s refusal, the English 
decided to take to military action. Accordingly, the English launched an attack on 
the Fredrick Fort in Trincomalee which was under Dutch rule and captured it on 
26 th August 1795. Later the English succeeded in capturing all the forts in Jaffna, 
Mannar, Kalpitiya and Colombo respectively. By February 1796, all the coastal areas 
of this country which had been under Dutch rule had been brought under the rule 
of the English East India Company.

 The following are the significant stages of the British rule in coastal areas of this 
country from 1796 until the capture of the Kandyan Kingdom in 1815:

  Rule under East India Company from 1796 to 1798
  Dual control from 1798 - 1802
  Rule under British Crown from 1802 onwards

All  of  the  military  expenses  on  capturing  the  coastal  areas  of  this  country  were 
incurred  by  English  East  India  Company.    Therefore  the  English  Company 
continued ruling this country with the objectives of covering their military expenses 
and boosting their income. Accordingly, the officers of the Company took steps to 
collect more taxes from the coastal areas. Collection of taxes was done by a group of 
officers called Aumildar who were brought to this country from Madras. People of 
the coastal areas, who were oppressed with the heavy burden of taxes that had been 
imposed on them by the company, started a serious riot against the English in 1797.  

 
28

The Riot that erupted in the Coastal Aareas in 1797

There are several reasons that led to the eruption of the riot against the rule of the 
English East India Trade Company in the coastal areas of Sri Lanka in 1797:     

  Imposing of several new taxes by the English East India Company (e.g.: tax on 

coconut trees, tax on salt, tax on fish, tax on tobacco)

  The opposition of the people against removal of local officers from collecting 

taxes and employing of officers called Aumildar, who were brought from Madras, 
to collect taxes.    

  Having to pay taxes in cash instead of the traditional method of paying taxes in 
goods thereby causing people to terribly suffer because the use of currency was 

   not popular among people. 

The English curbed the riot amidst great difficulties and then appointed a commission 
headed by Colonel Meuron to find out the reasons that led to the eruption of the 
riot. It was called “The Meuron Commission”. The Meuron Commission put forward 
a number of proposals in order to bring the civil life in the coastal areas to normality. 
Through the recommendations of the Commission it had been explained that such 
a situation had arisen since officers who had been accustomed to engaging in trade 
activities had begun to be involved in administration. Accordingly, the Commission 
had  recommended  that  trade  and  administration  should  be  handled  by  separate 
groups of officers.   

Dual Control (1798 – 1802 AD)

Dual control refers to the system of administration adopted in ruling the coastal 
areas  according  to  which  the  trade  activities  were  handled  by  the  English  Trade 
Company and the political affairs were handled with the involvement of the British 
government.  Under  this  system  the  Trade  Company  was  allowed  to  continue  to 
engage in trade activities and to collect revenue, and a governor named Sir Frederick 
North was appointed in 1798 to handle the administrative and military affairs. 

 During the period from 1798 to 1802, in which the dual control was in effect, there 
formed two groups of officers, namely officers of the governor and officers of the 
Trade Company. The governor did not receive the cooperation that was expected of 
the officers of the Trade Company. This led to the deterioration of the administration 
and the dual control system became a failure.    

  
  
  
  
  
29

The Coastal Areas becoming a Colony of the Crown

 As  the  dual  control  system  was  proved  a  failure,  full  involvement  of  the  British 
government was needed in order to handle the affairs of this country. Hence the 
authority that had been granted to the Trade Company was terminated in 1802 and 
full administration of the coastal areas was undertaken by the British government. 
As the King was the head of the British Government and as the crown symbolizes 
the King, such ruling system was called a colony of the Crown.  

Capture of the Kandyan Kingdom by the English

The English invaded the Kandyan Kingdom twice, i.e. in 1803 and in 1815, with 
the  objective  of  capturing  the  Kingdom.  By  year  1803,  there  had  been  a  healthy 
relationship between the King and the people and therefore the invasion that the 
English  launched  in  that  year  was  an  utter  failure.  However,  by  year  1815,  the 
Kandyan  King  had  lost  the  faith  of  his  people,  and  therefore  the  English  could 
achieve their goal.   

Invasion of the Kandyan Kingdom in 1803

The English were not happy that Kandyan Kingdom existed as a separate, independent 
kingdom while the English were ruling the coastal areas of the country. Therefore, 
Governor Frederick North wanted either to make Kandy a kingdom that was loyal 
to the English or to capture it. The following can be considered as the causes that led 
the English to invade the Kandyan Kingdom: people even in the areas under the rule 
of the English considered the Kandyan King to be their king; the English thought 
that the Kandyan King will support the riots that erupt in low country areas against 
the  English;  the  Kandyan  Kingdom  was  a  barrier  in  maintaining  relationships 
between Colombo and Trincomalee along land routes; and the English feared that 
the Kandyan King would seek the support of the French to fight against the English. 
After the death of King Rajadhirajasinghe in 1798, Prince Kannasamy ascended the 
throne as King Sri Vickrama Rajasinghe, but there was another prince named Prince 
Muththusamy who had equal right to the throne. When Prince Kannasamy became 
King, Prince Muththusamy fled to the English and, with future expectations, the 
English gave him protection. 

 In  1800,  Governor  North  sent  an  army  led  by  General  McDowall  to  Kandy  and 
made efforts at getting King Sri Vickrama Rajasinghe agree to conditions that were 
advantageous for the English, but those efforts did not yield the expected results as 
the King did not agree to the conditions laid down by the English. Later, Governor 

 
30

North made arrangements to invade the Kandyan Kingdom in 1803. This invasion 
was led by General McDowall and Governor North made arrangements to send to 
Kandy two troops from Colombo and Trincomalee. These armies entered the City 
of Kandy in February 1803. 

 The English who captured the City of Kandy declared Prince Muththusamy the King 
of the Kandyan Kingdom. As King Sri Vickrama Rajasinghe had gone into hiding, 
the Kandyans refused to accept Muththusamy as their king because Muththusamy 
was loyal to the English.  

 The  Kandyans  who  were  getting  ready  to  attack  the  English  strategically  delayed 
launching their attack until the rainy season arrived. Soon after the rainy season 
had  started,  the  Kandyans  launched  their  attack  on  the  English  blocking  all  the 
main routes that had been used to maintain relationships between Colombo and 
Kandy and prevented the supply of food and armaments to the English army. As 
a result, the English army got confined to Kandy city and became utterly helpless 
due to the shortage of food and catching of diseases such as malaria. The English 
army then realized that they were facing near death and therefore tried to retreat, 
but  they  had  no  chance  for  retreating  because  the  Kandyans  had  blocked  all  the 
access routes to the city. At this juncture, King Sri Vickrama Rajasinghe ordered the 
English to hand over to him Prince Muththusamy, whom the English had declared 
the  king  of  Kandy.  Although  Major  Dave  immediately  fulfilled  that  order,  the 
Kandyans massacred every one of the English army including prince Muththusamy. 
In this way, the first attempt of the English to capture the Kandyan kingdom ended 
resulting in a devastating defeat for the English. 

     Governor Thomas Maitland

 After the end of the period of service of Governor Frederick North, 
Thomas  Maitland  was  appointed  as  the  Governor  of  Ceylon  in 
1805. Maitland, who was more strategic than North, realized that 
the English could not achieve the expected victories as long as 
a healthy relationship would exist between the King and the 
people of Kandy. Therefore, Governor Maitland adopted a 
very strategic policy towards the Kandyan kingdom.   
 Some  of  the  key  features  of  the  strategic  policy 
of  Maitland  were  to  act  in  a  way  that  led  to 
the  escalation  of  the  existing  internal  disputes 
within  Kandyan  kingdom  and  to  secretly  collect 
all  information  about  the  kingdom.  In  order  to 
implement  these  policies,  he  employed  a  skillful 
officer called John D’Oyly.   

31

     John D’Oyly

John  D’Oyly,  who  was  born  in  England  in  1774,  came  to  Sri  Lanka  as  a 
government  officer  after  completion  of  his  education.  While  serving  in  this 
country as an officer of the Public Administration Service or the Civil Service, 
D’Oyly also studied Sinhala language. Being an efficient, young officer, he learnt 
Sinhala within a short period of time and also gained an understanding about 
the  traditions  and  customs  of  the  people  of  this  country,  and  he  went  on  to 
work as a government translator. Governor Maitland, having understood the 
capabilities of D’Oyly, employed him to collect intelligence information on the 
Kandyan kingdom. 

D’Oyly first kept company with the Kandyan elites who maintained relationships 
with the low country people and through those elites he established relationships 
with high ranking leaders of the Kandyan kingdom. In this way, he had built 
up relationships with Kandyan leaders such as Pilimathalawwa, Meegasthenna, 
Ehelepola,  and  Molligoda.  In  addition  to  this,  he  also  collected  information 
about the Kandyan kingdom through spies who had been employed in disguise. 
Because  of  D’Oyly’s  remarkably  efficient  service,  the  English  succeeded  in 
disclosing even the military secrets of the Kandyan kingdom which no European 
had  been  able  to  do  before  that.  D’Oyly’s  diary  reveals  a  lot  of  important 
information about the relationships he had with the Kandyan kingdom.

The Internal Power Struggle in the Kandyan Kingdom

The  political  situation  of  the  Kandyan  kingdom  was  turning  very  bad  after  year 
1803. The solidarity that existed there between the King and the people at the time 
when the English attempted to capture the Kandyan kingdom in 1803 had begun to 
deteriorate by 1815. 

Escalation of the power struggle within the Kandyan kingdom during the reign of 
King Sri Vickrama Rajasinghe resulted in the deterioration of the solidarity that had 
existed so far in the kingdom. Such power struggles can be discussed under several 
topics as follows:    

32

Disputes between the King and the High Ranking Nobles

 There erupted a dispute between King Sri Vickrama Rajasinghe and the Kandyan 
aristocracy because of the measures taken by the king to limit the power of those 
aristocrats. Some of the significant incidents that led to such disputes are as follows:  

  Duties that had been assigned to some of the aristocrats were assigned by 

the king to his Nayakkar relatives. 

  The king inflicted punishments to aristocrats who harassed or ill-treated 

citizens.

  Death penalty was imposed on Pilimathalawwe Maha Adhikaram who 

supported him to become king.

  Some parts of the kingdom where the powers of the aristocracy had 

increased were divided into small administrative units and new officers 
and aristocrats were appointed to those units (e.g: dividing Sabaragamuwa 

   Dissawa into two).
  The king made new appointments in a way that led controversies among 

the aristocracy. 
(e.g: After the death of Pilimathalawwe, Ehelepola was appointed to the 
vacant position of Maha Adhikarama, and Molligoda, who was an 
   opponent of Ehelepola, was appointed to a lower Adhikarama position)

 Disputes that arose between the King and the Bhikkus

  The king imposed death penalty on some Bhikkus including Paranathala 
   Kuda Thero accusing them to be traitors.
  The king did not obtain the concurrence of the Bhikkus for the 
   modernization activities that were implemented around the Dalada 
   Maligawa (Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic). 
  The Bhikkus considered the proposal put forward by the king to remove 
the Poyamalu Temple and Sathara Devala to facilitate the expansion of 

   Bogambara tank as an anti-Buddhist activity.

political unity deteriorated.

  Some of the chiefs of the administrative divisions belonging to the Kandyan 
   Kingdom began to act against one another and as a result, the relationship 

between the king and those chiefs broke up.  

Disputes between the King and the General Public

 People  getting  distanced  from  the  king  can  be  considered  as  the  climax  of  the 
disputes that had erupted in the Kandyan kingdom. King Sri Vickrama Rajasinghe 
who initially had gentle qualities later took to drink and began to behave in a very 
cruel manner. He successfully curbed the riot that erupted in Sabaragamuwa, but he 
went on to impose death penalty on over one hundred people who were suspected 
to have been involved in the riot. As the king was unable to catch Ehelepola who 
rebelled  against  him,  he  arrested  Ehelepola’s  wife  and  his  children  and  punished 
them cruelly which resulted in serious worry among people. People who came to 
Kandy  from  areas  such  as  Sabaragamuwa  and  Sathara  Koralaya  to  perform  their 
service duties in the city were prohibited by the king to get accommodation in the 
capital city  during  the  night.  It was  reported  to have  been  a  great  inconvenience 
for the people who came to Kandy from those areas. The general public held the 
Buddhist monks and the Kandyan chiefs in great respect, and as the king executed 
some Buddhist monks and suspected the chiefs, the relationship between the king 
and the people broke up.  

Invasion of the Kandyan Kingdom in 1815 and the Arrest of the King

Robert Brownrigg, who was the Governor of Ceylon at that time, understood that 
the conflict situation that had been created in the Kandyan kingdom by year 1815 
was the best opportunity for the English to take advantage of.

On intelligence information that had been collected by John D’Oyly and on the advice 
of Ehelepola, who had by this time fled to the English for protection, arrangements 
were made for the invasion of the Kandyan kingdom. Brownrigg strategically took 
measures to send the English army to Kandy announcing that he was sending the 
English army to Kandy in order to ensure the safety of the people since the people 
were highly disappointed with the activities of the king.

Eight  brigades 
from 
Colombo,  Galle,  Negombo,  Trincomalee 
and  Batticaloa  for  the  invasion  of  the 
Kingdom  of  Kandy.  When  the  English 
army  entered  the  city  of  Kandy  without 
facing  any  difficulty,  King  Sri  Vickrama 
Rajasinghe  realized  that  the  Kandyan 
people  and  the  aristocracy  who  had  been 
there  for  his  protection  at  the  beginning 
were no more with him and therefore he fled 
to Medamahanuwara with his two queens. 
The king who was in hiding at a place called 
Bomure in Medamnahanuwara with his two 
queens, was caught by a group of Kandyan 
people. Then the king and the two queens 
were kept under the custody of D’Oyly and 
later  they  were  brought  to  Colombo  and 
were deported to Vellore in India in 1816. 
While the king was imprisoned in Vellore, 
he died due to a stomach illness. With the 
arrest of King Sri Vickrama Rajasinghe, the 
English  succeeded  in  achieving  a  victory 

  Figure 2.5 – Queen Rangamma,

that neither the Portuguse nor the Dutch had ever been able to. Such victiory could 
be achieved because of the strategies the English had adopted and due to the internal 
power struggle that existed in the Kandyan kingdom.  

Signing of the Kandyan Convention

35

Figure 2.6 – Signing of the Kandyan Convention

King  Sri  Vickrama  Rajasinghe  was  arrested  by  the  English  because  the  English 
received the support of the Kandyan aristocracy. Now the English went on to further 
establish their victory by entering into an agreement with the Kandyan chiefs. Before 
this agreement was signed at the Magula Maduwa (Royal Audience Hall) in Kandy 
on  02  March  1815,  an  English  soldier  lowered  the  Sinhala  flag  and  hoisted  the 
English flag. Legend says that, Wariayapola Sri Sumangala Thero, on witnessing this 
incident, had bravely come forward saying that the English did not have any right 
in this country before signing of the treaty, and then he had lowered the English 
flag  and  had  raised  the  Sinhala  flag  again.  Robert  Brownrigg,  on  behalf  of  King 
George III of Britain, and the chiefs of the Kandyan kingdom were signitories to this 
agreement that was signed on 02 March 1815. It is called the Kandyan Convention 
of 1815. According to D’Oyly’s diary, some of the chiefs had signed it on 10 March. 
The Kandyan Convention contains 12 main clauses. Accordingly, the contents of 
some of the significant cluases are as follows: 

36

  Clause  2  –This  clause  states  that 
King  Sri  Vickrama  Rajasinghe  had 
been ousted from the throne and all 
the rights that all of his relations had 
to the throne have been abolished. 

	Clause 4 -  It is stated in this clause 
that  the  positions  of  the  traditional 
officers of the Kandyan kingdom such 
as  Mohottala,  Korala,  Vidanes  and  
other  chiefs,  and  the  rights  relevant 
to those positions will be protected.

	Clause 5 – It is stated that Buddhism 
and religions of the citizens, Bhikkus 
and temples would be protected. 

  Clauses  6,  7  –  It  is  stated  in 
these  clauses  that  old  systems  of 
punishment  such  as  amputation 
would be abolished and death penalty 
would  be  imposed  only  under  the 
authority of the governor.

Freedom Struggle in 1818

With the capture of the Kandyan kingdom by the English in 1815, certain changes 
took place in the administration system that the Kandyans had been familiar with. 
Under the traditional system that had existed, there had been a king in Kandy to 
whom the Kandyans could express their greivances and find relief. After the capture 
of the kingdom, the King of Britain became the King of the Kandyan kingdom, too, 
but the new king was a person whom the Kandyans had never seen or one who had 
never lived in this country. Therefore the Kandyans felt that they were experiencing 
a state of anarchy.  

 British soldiers marched through the streets of the City of Kandy too often, which 
was a sight that the Kandyans had not been familiar with before. Their language, 
customs and traditions, and etiquettes were not familiar to the Kandyans. Under 
the new administration, the social status of the Kandyan chiefs, too, deteriorated. 
Although  the  native  Kandyans  respected  their  local  chiefs,  such  respect  was  not 
accorded to those chiefs by the British soldiers. 
 The traditional sources of income of the Kandyan aristocracy were affected by the 
new tax systems imposed by the English. Further, the Kandyans feared that their 
religion and culture would be in danger because the country was ruled by foreigners. 
For  all  such  reasons,  the  Kandyans  made  arrangements  to  launch  a  rebellion  to 
regain the freedom they had lost.  

Factors that led to the Launching of 1818 Rebellion

  The disappointment the people felt because they did not have a king
  The fear people had felt that Buddhism would be destroyed
  The way of life of the people getting upset because of the administrative 
and law reforms implemented by the British disregarding the local 
traditions and customs

  The powers, privileges, and sources of income of the aristocracy becoming 
   unsafe
  The immediate cause that led to the freedom struggle in 1818 was the 
opposition that was aroused among the Sinhalese because of the  
appointment of a Muslim named Hadji Marikkar as Muhandiram of Madige in 

   Wellassa where the majority of the people were Sinhalese. 

  
  
  
  
38

Beginning of the Struggle and its Expansion

 While the Kandyans were disappointed with the rule of the English, one Doraisamy 
who  appeared  as  the  Kandyan  king  began  to  mobilize  people  in  Wellassa  area. 
When the Agent of Uva got to know about Doraisamy, he sent a team led by Hadji 
Marikkar  to  Wellassa  area  to  arrest  Doraisamy,  but  Marikkar  died  at  the  hands 
of  the  combatants.  Once  again,  Wilson,  who  was  the  Sub-agent  of  Badulla,  and 
Lieutenant Newman left for Wellassa to arrest Doraisamy, but Wilson was killed by 
the combatants. After the clash that occurred on this occasion, the English realized 
that the Uva – Wellassa clashes should not be considered as minor incidents.

 When  the  English  realized  that  the  rebellion  was  on  the  expansion,  they  sent 
Monarawila Keppetipola,  who  was in-charge-of  the Uva  Dissawa  at  that  time,  to 
curb the situation. However, Keppetipola accepted the request made by the people 
in Wellassa to support the rebellion, and therefore he returned the armaments that 
the English had given to him. He not only joined the struggle, but then went on 
to  lead  it. Thereafter,  Keppetipola  became  a  prominent  leader  in  the  struggle  for 
freedom.  

 The  rebellion  that  was  launched  from  Wellassa  area  then  spread  to  Dumbara, 
Hewaheta,  Harispaththuwa,  Matale,  Nuwarakalaviya,  Hathkoralaya,  and  also  to 
areas in Sabaragamuwa within a very short period of time.   
 Some of the prominent leaders of the freedom struggle:

	Keppetipola Nilame
	Madugalle Dissawa
	Kivulegedara Mohottala
	Second Adhikaram of Pilimathalawwe
	Butewe Rate Rala
	Kohukumbure Rala

 While Keppetipola Nilame led the combatants from Uva Wellassa areas, Madugalle 
and Udagabada Nilame led Dumbara and Thumpane areas, and Pilimatalawe led 
Hathkoralaya area and thus the struggle was carried on.
The English army suffered heavy losses because of the guerrilla strategies adopted 
by the Sinhala army. The Sinhala troops were further encouraged by the fact they 
had been able to secretely take out the Sacred Tooth Relic from the Temple of the

The English army suffered heavy losses because of the guerrilla strategies adopted

severe hardships and very soon the struggle 
became a failure.  

  Figure 2.9 – Keppetipola Nilame

Reasons for the Failure of the Struggle

  The struggle had not been properly organized.
  The combatants failed to effectively withstand the ruthlessly suppressing 
   policy adopted by the English to curb the struggle.
  There existed personal grudges between the leaders who led the struggle.
  The combatants failed to resist the weapon power of the English. 
  The combatants were discouraged by the revelation of the fact that 
   Doraisamy who appeared as the king was not the real Doraisamy. 

The Impacts of the Struggle

  Leaders such as Keppetipola and Madugalle, who led the struggle, were 

convicted through a military court and were beheaded. 

  Another group including Ehelepola were exiled to Mauritius island. 
  British power was established in the Kandyan kingdom through the Kandy 
   proclamations of 1818 disregarding the Kandyan Convention of 1815. 

  
  
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
40

  The powers and privileges that had been granted to the Kandyan chiefs 
   were abolished and those powers and privileges were granted to English 

officers.

Freedom Struggle of 1848

 The  Kandyans  who  suffered  under  the  British  rule  once  again  rose  against  the 
foreign rule in 1848 with the intention of making a king from among themselves. 
It is called the second freedom struggle. Although the first freedom struggle that 
was launched in 1818 began under the leadership of the Kandyan chiefs, it was a 
significant feature of the 1848 struggle that it erupted under the leadership of those 
who came from among common men.   

Reasons for the Eruption of the 1848 Struggle

Impact of the Constitutional Reforms of Colebrooke

 Proposals  of  Colebrook  contributed  a  lot  towards  the  eruption  of  the  freedom 
struggle of 1848.

 Plantations were started under Colebrook reforms and a policy of selling lands was 
implemented to create the estates required for plantations. In terms of the Lands 
Act that was introduced in 1840, a large number of lands of which the ownership 
could not be verified were acquired by the government and thereby many people 
lost their traditional lands and farmlands. 

 As  the  British  gave  priority  to  the  development  of  plantations,  the  traditional 
agriculture  of  this  country  deteriorated  and  the  rural  lifestyles  were  seriously 
affected.    

  With the weakening of village councils which carried out functions such 

as maintenance of rural irrigation systems and resolving of minor disputes 
in rural areas, the rural lifestyle collapsed.

  The relationship between the government and the people was further distanced 
and therefore the rulers were unable to identify the actual needs of the people.
  Under the rule of the British, Buddhism was neglected and liquor shops were  
opened in the Kandyan areas which led to the deterioration of social ethics. 

  
   
  
  
  
 
 
41

  The new tax policy of Lord Torrington

By this time, the income that the government could generate through coffee trade 
had dropped and Lord Torrington, the then governor of Ceylon imposed a number 
of new taxes. Imposing of new taxes in this manner was the immediate cause of the 
struggle. Some of those taxes are as follows:

* stamp duty 
* poll-tax    

* dog tax      * boat tax        * gun tax  * cart tax 
* shop tax   

Beginning of the Struggle

 In  many  parts  of  the  country,  massive  protests  sparked  opposing  the  new  taxes 
imposed by Lord Torrington. A strong protest came from the people against the poll-
tax, dog tax and the gun tax. In July 1848, a group of protesters led by Madugalle, 
Rate Mahattaya of Dumbara, came to meet the Agent of Kandy in protest against 
the  new  taxes.    Police  officer  Lokubanda  Dunuwila,  who  came  to  disperse  these 
protesters, was assaulted by the protesters until he fell off from horseback. It did 
not take long for these protests to develop into a rebellion against British rule. The 
leading centre of this struggle was Matale. By July 1848, the areas namely Matale, 
Kurunegala, Nuwarakalaviya, Thamankaduwa, and Harispatthuwa had fallen into 
the  hands  of  the  combatants.  However,  the  efforts  of  the  combatants  to  capture 
Kandy were not successful.   

Some of the leaders of the 1848 freedom struggle:

  Gongalegoda Banda (David of Peliyagoda)
  Puranappu (Francisco)
  Dingirala

Contemporary records indicate that, in July 1848, Gongalegoda Banda was crowned 
as Sri Wickrama Sarvasiddhi at a ceremony held in Dambulla which was attended by 
a large number of people.   

  
  
42

Failure of the Struggle

  Although protests sparked in many areas in both the upcountry and the low 

country against the new tax policy of the British, the struggle spread only to a 
few areas in the upcountry. 

  From the very beginning of the struggle, the English led their armies 

strategically and prevented the spread of the struggle. Therefore it was limited to 
a few areas such as Matale, Kurunegala and Kandy.

  Governor Lord Torrington imposed martial law and suppressed the struggle 
   within a few days, and arrested the leaders of the struggle.

  Kadahapola Thero, Puran Appu and Dingirala were convicted through a 
   military court and were shot dead. Gongalegoda Banda was lashed with a 
   whip and was expelled from the country.

  After the leaders had been arrested and punished, the second freedom struggle 

against the British, too, ended with defeat.

Impact of the Struggle

  After the struggle had ended, a committee headed by Mr. Bailey was  

appointed to find the causes of the struggle. 

  As per the recommendations of the committee, Governor Torrington and
   Emerson Tennent, the Colonial Secretary, were removed from their posts 

and were called back to England.

  The shop tax and the dog tax were repealed and the stamp duty, gun tax and poll-

tax were revised. 

  The government took measures to develop the agriculture and irrigation works.

	The Sacred Tooth Relic was taken back into the custody of the British.

2.2 Economic Development that took place under the British Rule

After the British had strengthened their power in this country, they converted the 
system  of  economy  that  had  existed  in  this  country  into  a  market  economy. The 
environment required for developing of a market economy was created through the 
Colebrooke  reforms  that  were  implemented  in  1833.  The  economic  reforms  that 
were introduced by the British brought about an enormous change not only in the 
economy of the country, but also in the social patterns. 

The  economic  situation  that  had  prevailed  in  this  country  before  the  British 
started plantations .

When the British arrived in this country, there existed in the Kingdom of Kandy 
a  rural  agriculture-based  economic  system  which  had  been  developing  since  the 

  
 
  
  
44

times  of  Rajarata  civilization.  Under  this  economic  system,  which  can  be  called 
a rural, self-sufficient economy, the food required for the village was produced in 
the village itself. High-land cultivation, wet-land cultivation and animal husbandry 
were the key fields of the system of agriculture that existed in the Kandyan kingdom 
of that period. People produced things only to meet their day-to-day requirements 
and  cultivation  of  commercial  crops  was  not  popular.  In  addition  to  agriculture, 
there also existed trade, industries and provision of services. Such trades, industries 
and services were mostly organized based on the caste system that existed in the 
Kandyan society. In this economic system, a system of compulsory labour service 
was in place in order to obtain the labour required for the government. The low 
country areas had been under the rule of the Europeans since the end of the 16th 
century. Therefore, when compared to the upcountry areas, the use of currency was 
more popular in the low country areas. As a result of the influence of the Europeans, 
people of the low country areas seemed to be getting accustomed to the economic 
changes that were taking place.

Lanka before the arrival of the British in this country. 

The British taking to Tea Cultivation

 A  prominent  feature  of  the  colonial  poicy  of  the  British  was  that  they  made 
maximum use of the resources available in the countries they conquered in order to 
generate as much profits as possible. 

 After establishing their power in the entire country having captured the Kandyan 
kingdom in 1815, the British realized that it was not possible for them to gain the 
expected profits through the traditional, agricultural economy that was existing in 
the country. Accordingly, in order to increase their income, the British implemented 
economic  reforms,  and  as  a  result,  they  seem  to  have  taken  to  cultivation  of 
commercial crops or estate plantations. 
 The Colebrooke Commission arrived in Sri Lanka in year 1829 in order to identify 
the reforms that should be introduced in this country with a view to increasing the 
income level of the country as well as developing the economy. As recommendations 
of the Colebrooke Commission had been implemented since 1833, the background 
required for the development of the plantation sector was created in this country. 

45

Some of the recommendations of the Colebrooke  Commission which resulted in 
the advancement in the plantation sector are given below. Those proposals aimed 
at  encouraging  the  private  sector  which  would  result  in  the  development  of  the 
economy so that there would be long-term increase in the government revenue. 

  Implementing a policy of selling state lands

  Providing opportunity for local as well as foreign private entrepreneurs to 

buy lands

  Formulation of policies to suit the objectives of the private entrepreneurs 

Until 1830s, the British had not been able to generate the expected income from this 
country under the British rule. The expenses on administration had been very much 
higher than the income they had been able to generate from the country. Accordingly, 
the  Colebrooke  Commission  had  made  the  following  recommendations  to  cut 
down government expenditure: 

  Closing down some of the government departments and merging some 

others in order to cut down expenses on administration.

  Reducing the number of civil servants and reducing their salaries.
  Merging the upcountry and the low country for reducing administrative  

expenses.

The British expected to reduce the government expenditure by way of implementing 
the above mentioned proposals. 

The Government Policy of selling Lands

In  order  to  obtain  lands  required  for  making  estates,  the  traditional  lands  of  the 
villagers  in  the  upcountry  areas  to  which  there  had  been  no  legal  documents  to 
prove their ownership, were acquired by the government under the Lands Act of 
1840. A policy was formulated for selling lands so that any extent of lands that were 
acquired by the government in that manner could be bought by any local or foreign 
entrepreneur.  

Through this land policy of the government, both local and foreign planters got the 
opportunity to buy lands in this country at very low prices. Moreover, the laws that 
had been imposed restricting foreigners to buy lands this country and to settle in 
this country were repealed. Accordingly, planters from foreign countries came to 

  
  
 
 
46

Sri Lanka and invested money on estate plantations. 

Formulating Policies to be in line with the Objectives of Private Businesses

  Providing opportunity for the European business community to represent 

the Legislative Council

  Ending the monopoly the government had to sell items such as cinnamon 

and salt

  Implementing the judicial reforms of Cameron

  Taking measures to establish a savings bank

  Abolishing the compulsory labour service system

Development of the Estate Plantations

 Implementation  of  the  Colebrook  reforms  mentioned  above  facilitated  a  rapid 
development  in  the  estate  plantations  of  this  country.  The  forest  areas  in  the 
upcountry and those in the low country, that had been under natural forest cover 
and the traditional chenas and farmlands, were soon converted into extensive ranges 
of estates. Accordingly, the following crops began to be cultivated in the estates thus 
created:

coffee, cinchona, cocoa, tea, coconut, rubber

Coffee

 Coffee was the first cash crop that was cultivated in this country under the British 
rule. Before the arrival of the British, coffee had been grown as a garden crop, but 
it had not been cultivated as a commercial crop. It is accepted that a planter named 
George Bird cultivated a coffee estate for the first time in the history of this country 
in 1822 in Sinha Pitiya, Gampola. Later in 1824, Governor Edward Barnes cultivated 
a coffee estate in one of his private lands in Gannoruwa.   

  
  
 
47

Figure 2.10 – A coffee factory

As  cultivating  coffee  became  popular,  private  investors,  too,  bought  lands  and 
took to coffee cultivation. Consequently, the extent of lands that had been brought 
under coffee cultivation by about year 1848 had exceeded 60,000 acres. Some of the 
reasons that resulted in the development of coffee cultivation in this country were 
as follows:

  As drinking coffee had become popular in European countries, the demand 

for coffee increased and big profits could be earned through coffee 
cultivation. 

  Coffee of very high quality could be produced in this country at a low cost.  

  A large number of entrepreneurs took to coffee cultivation after 

implementation of the Colebrooke reforms.

  Duty that had been imposed on coffee that was exported to England from this 

country was reduced. 

Coffee cultivation, which developed rapidly in this country, began to decline after 
1848. There are several reasons that caused such a decline:

  As coffee was exported to the European market from Southeast Asian 
countries such as Java, the demand that had been there for the coffee 
exported from Sri Lanka dropped. 

  
  
  
  
  
  
48

  The  world  economic  crisis  that  took  place  in  1848  had  an  adverse  impact  on 
coffee trade.

  Large  extents  of  coffee  cultivations  were  destroyed  as  those  cultivations  had 
caught a fungal disease called Hemileia Vastatrix since 1869.   

Cinchona and Cocoa Cultivations

 After the deterioration of coffee cultivation in 1848, the planters of estates in this 
country took to cultivation of other commercial crops. Consequently, planters drew 
more attention towards cinchona and cocoa cultivations. Cinchona is a herbal plant. 
It is used to manufacture a type of medicine called quinine which is used to treat 
malaria patients. Although cinchona was cultivated in many estates, the demand for 
cinchona in the world market declined and consequently it did not generate long-
term profits. Therefore, planters gave up cultivating cinchona.   

 As an alternative to coffee cultivation, the government introduced cocoa cultivation, 
but it did not succeed as a commercial crop because, on the one hand, it was very 
costly to cultivate cocoa, and on the other hand, cocoa could be cultivated only in a 
very limited area of the country.

After 
deteriorated, 
cultivations 
of  cinchona  and  cocoa,  which  were 
introduced as alternative crops to coffee, 
had  failed,  the  government  was  very 
keen on identifying the crop that is most 
suitable  for  this  country.  As  a  result,  tea 
was identified as the cash crop that is the 
most suitable for the climatic conditions 
of  the  upcountry  areas  of  Sri  Lanka. 
Growing  tea  plants  in  this  country  was 
tested for the first time in about 1873 by 
an  Englishman  named  James  Tailor.  He 
planted tea in a few acres in Lulkandura 
Estate  that  belonged  to  him  and  made 
efforts  to  identify  the  kinds  of  tea  that 
were suitable for this country. 

Figure 2.11 – Cocoa

Tea cultivation in this country, which was started in a small estate of about 10 acres, 
had achieved a massive progress by year 1890. It was reported that, by that time tea 
cultivation  had  spread  to  about  220,000  acres.  Accordingly,  tea  became  the  most 
prominent export economic crop of this country due to many reasons such as those 
given below:

  Prevalence of climatic conditions that are highly suitable for tea cultivation 

in the wet zone of this country. 

  There was a high demand in the London market and in the world market for 

Sri Lankan tea.

  Development of railway tracks and the road system had a great impact on the 
  development of tea cultivations. 
  Labour required for tea cultivations could be obtained easily and cheaply because 

labourers could be brought to this country from South India. 

  High profits could be generated at a low production cost.

 
 
 
50

Coconut Cultivation

  Coconut  was  another  cultivation  that  was  developed  under  the  British  rule. 
Although coconut had been grown in this country since ancient times, it had not 
been cultivated as an export crop. Literary sources of this country reveal that the 
rulers of this country from the times of Dambadeniya kingdom to Kotte kingdom 
had taken steps to expand coconut cultivation in the country. However, developing 
coconut cultivation as an export crop was started during the British rule. By about 
year 1910, coconut cultivation had expanded in about 850,000 acres centred around 
Kurunegala,  Gampaha  and  Chilaw  areas.  The  owners  of  most  of  the  coconut 
estates of this country were local businessmen, and export of coconut was handled 
almost  completely  by  foreign  companies.  The  coconut  produced  in  this  country 
was exported in the forms of coconut oil, copra and poonac. A coconut research 
institute  was  established  in  Lunuwila  for  the  development  of  coconut  cultivation 
and for research activities as well.   

Rubber Cultivation

Some  of  the  British  companies  in  this  country  showed  an  interest  in  starting 
rubber cultivation for the first time in Sri Lanka since rubber is another commercial 
crop that suits the climatic conditions prevailing in this country. A few rubber plants 
that had been planted in the Kew Garden in England were brought to this country, 
and they were planted in Peradeniya and Henarathgoda Botanical Gardens in year 
1877. This can be considered as the beginning of rubber cultivation in Sri Lanka. 
After  year  1910,  local  planters  drew  more  attention  towards  cultivating  rubber. 
Rubber cultivation expanded rapidly during the period from year 1900 to 1906 and 
the price of rubber, too, increased comparatively during that period. Some planters 
gave up cinnamon cultivation and planted rubber in those lands. The following are 
some of the factors that led to the development of rubber cultivation:

  There was a big demand in the USA for the rubber produced in Sri Lanka.
  Price of rubber in the world market increased after the World War I.
  With the development of the automobile industry in Europe, the demand 

for rubber increased, too.

  The soil and the climatic conditions of this country were very suitable for 

rubber cultivation.

Development of the Local Agriculture

After the entire country had become a British colony in 1815, the socio-economic 
system that had existed in this country was subjected to a dramatic transformation. 
The British rulers realized that a market economy could not be developed through 
the traditional, agro-economic system that existed in this country. Therefore they 
adopted a policy of giving priority to estate cultivations neglecting the traditional 
agriculture  of  the  country.  Because  of  the  recommendations  put  forward  by  the 
Colebrook Commission in 1833 for the establishment of an estate economy in this 
country, the local agriculture was subjected to a serious decline. The following are 
some of the main factors that caused the collapse of local agriculture:  

  Lands Act that was introduced in 1840

Lands  which  could  not  be  proved  before  a  court  of  law  to  have  been  utilized 
continuously for 30 years were acquired by the government under the Lands Act. 
According to the land use system that had existed in this country, there had been no 
legal documents pertaining to the ownership of lands. Therefore, a large number of 
agricultural lands were acquired by the government and it resulted in the collapse 
of the local agriculture.

  The government neglected the maintenance of tanks and irrigation systems 
of this country which were essential for the agriculture, the livelihood of the majority 
of the population of this country. 

  As a result of the government policy of selling lands, local and foreign businessmen 
bought the traditional lands in the upcountry and the low country and those lands 
were utilized for making estates. 

52

  After the natural forests in the upcountry had been cleared and estate cultivations 
had been started, natural water sources dried up and agricultural lands in the low 
country were faced with the threat of destruction. 

  Compulsory labour service, under which the village council had obtained labour 
required for the maintenance of rural irrigation systems over a long period of time, 
was abolished and as a result agricultural activities could not be continued.

Efforts of the British at developing the Local Agriculture

  The  British  rulers  realized  that  one  of  the  main  causes  for  the  people  to  rise 
against the British rule in 1848 was the policy they had adopted neglecting the local 
agriculture. Accordingly, several Governors who were in charge of the administration 
of this country after 1850 drew attention towards developing the local agriculture of 
this country and took steps to renovate the irrigation systems and also looked into 
the  welfare  of  the  farmer  communities.  Among  such  activities,  the  following  are 
significant:

connected to River Walawe and Udukiriwala 

Establishment of the Department of Irrigation

Establishment of the Department of Irrigation by Governor West Ridgeway in 
1900 is a significant event in the irrigation sector of this country. Steps were taken 
to  recruit  to  this  Department  officers  who  had  knowledge  about  the  irrigation 
sector so that the functions of the Department could be performed efficiently. The 
Department  took  measures  to  maintain  the  irrigation  systems  that  had  already 
been renovated by that time and steps were also taken to identify and develop the 
irrigation systems that were needed according to the requirement of the population  
and this greatly benfitted the farmer communities. 

Establishment of Cooperative Societies

With the objective of ensuring the well-being and welfare of farmer communities, 
the cooperative society movement was founded by Governor McCullum in 1911. 
The following are some of the objectives of creating this movement:

  Providing loans to farmers at low rates of interest
  Reducing the debt burden of farmers and strengthening their economy
  Improving the welfare of the farmer communities in the country
  Developing the rural economy by way of strengthening the cooperative 

movement

Due to World War I that lasted during the period from 1914 – 1918, the shipping 
industry was badly affected and there arose difficulties in importing of food items 
that this country needed. Therefore, after the World War I had ended, the British 
rulers  realized  the  importance  of  developing  the  local  agriculture.  From  the 
beginning of the 20th century, there also arose the need for creating employment 
opportunities for the increasing population. Developing local agriculture was also a 
solution to the problem of unemployment. According to the Donoughmore reforms 
of 1931, Sri Lankan Ministers were appointed to a number of ministries including 
the  Ministry  of  Agriculture.  Furthermore,  as  universal  franchise  was  introduced 
under the Donoughmore constitution, politicians had to pay more attention to the 
needs  of  the  rural  people  of  the  country.  As  a  result,  further  steps  were  taken  to 
develop the agriculture. Launching a movement to establish farmer colonies in the 
Dry Zone by D.S. Senanayake during the period when State Council was in effect is 
an example for this.

Religious and National Revival of Sri Lanka

Introduction

The social systems and culture that had existed in Sri Lanka over a long 
period of time was subjected to various changes with the arrival of the Europeans, 
namely Portuguese, the Dutch and the English. The Portuguese spread Roman 
Catholicism while the Dutch spread Protestantism in the areas that were under 
their rule. The entire country became a colony of the British Empire in 1815 AD 
and  various  missionary  organizations  that  arrived  in  the  country  during  the 
rule of the British went on to spread Christianity. Consequently, the traditional 
religions  and  cultures  that  had  existed  in  the  country  began  to  get  affected  in 
numerous ways.

Because  of  the  damages  that  were  being  caused  to  the  religions  and 
cultures of the Lankans, there sparked towards the end of the 19th century a great 
revival  in  the  religions  and  cultures  of  the  Buddhists,  Hindus  and  Muslims  in 
Lanka. This revival is discussed in this lesson as the religious and national revival 
of Sri Lanka.

 
 
56

3.1 Missionary Organizations and Their Activities 

During  the  rule  of  the  British,  members  of  a  number  of  volunteer  organizations 
arrived  in  Sri  Lanka  for  the  purpose  of  spreading  Christianity.  Those  volunteer 
organizations were engaged in missions of spreading their religion and therefore, 
were  called  missionary  organizations.  The  following  are  some  of  the  missionary 
organizations that had arrived in Sri Lanka by early 19th century:

  London Missionary Society
  Baptist Missionary Society
  Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society
  American Ceylon Mission
  Church Missionary Society

These  missionary  organizations,  while  receiving  state  patronage,  implemented 
various  measures  to  spread  their  religion  throughout  Ceylon;  that  is  called  the 
Missionary Movement. In order to spread their religion, they implemented various 
programmes such as provision of education, distributing writings, giving lectures 
and implementing social service activities, etc.   

Education

Figure 3.1 – Richmond College, Galle (Established by the Wesleyan Missionaries)

 
 
 
 
 
 
57

The missionary organizations adopted various strategies to spread Christianity 
through  education.  The  missionaries  who  studied  Sinhala  and  Tamil  languages 
managed  the  education  in  rural  schools  in  local  language  mediums  while  others 
managed  the  education  in  urban  schools  in  English  medium.  The  education 
provided at missionary schools was aimed at spreading religion in this country and 
inculcating the Western culture in Lankan society. 

During  the  period  of  British  rule,  knowledge  of  English  language  was  a 
prerequisite for obtaining government employment. Because of this requirement, 
some youths from Sinhala and Tamil families that belonged to higher social classes 
who had received education in the English medium, abandoned their traditional 
religions, names and surnames, embraced Christianity and got high positions in the 
government. 

The missionaries divided among themselves the different parts of this country and 
carried out their activities of providing education. This resulted in the establishment 
of  a  number  of  missionary  schools  throughout  the  country  and  consequently, 
a  considerable  development  took  place  in  the  education  of  Lankans.  This  was  a 
positive impact of the missionary movement on this country.   

Using writings and lectures

Missionary organizations took measures to establish presses in Lanka and they 
published material such as books and magazines which contained writings on their 
religion, and distributed them among people throughout the country. Various books 
on  the  Bible  and  Christianity  were  translated  into  Sinhala  and  Tamil  languages. 
Missionaries  made  use  of  these  publications  to  inculcate  in  the  minds  of  the 
Lankans the ideas that those who followed Buddhism and Hinduism were heathens 
that worshipped  images, and their  religious practices  and  rituals  were  futile  acts. 
The following are the titles of some of the publications printed by the missionaries 
to spread their religion: 

	  Masika Thegga 				Uragala 	

  Lanka Nidhanaya

Moreover, missionary priests travelled to places such as temples and other places 
where people gathered, and presented lectures in Sinhala and Tamil languages in 
order to inculcate their religious beliefs in the minds the of people.  

58

Carrying out Social Service Work

  Missionaries made attempts to get closer to people by way of engaging in social 
service work such as offering of gifts to the poor and helpless and caring for the sick. 

  However, such measures implemented by the missionaries to spread their religion 
did  not  have  a  considerable  impact  on  the  people  in  rural  areas  of  the  country, 
but many Sinhalese and Tamils who were from well-to-do families in urban areas 
seemed to have embraced Christianity. The following are some of the reasons that 
led to the success of the activities implemented by the missionaries: 

  receiving state patronage
  using education for spreading religion
  establishment of presses
  having finances necessary for making various publications such as books,  
  newspapers and periodicals
  the organizational power the missionaries possessed.

Revival in Religion

  Towards the end of 19th century, there sparked a religious revival not only among 
the Buddhists in this country, but among the Hindus and the Muslims as well. There 
were several reasons that resulted in a religious revival in this manner:

  spread of Christianity by the missionaries had an adverse impact on the local 

religions that had existed in Lanka.

  not directing sufficient attention by the government towards developing 

education in Sinhala and Tamil mediums in vernacular schools.

  the fear people had developed that their culture would be destroyed under the    

rule of the British. 

 
 
 
 
    
3.2   Buddhist Revival Movement

59

  The  Buddhist  monks  of  this  country  led  the  Buddhist  revival  movement  that 
was  launched  towards  the  end  of  the  19th  century.  Later,  educated  lay  men,  too, 
supported this movement.

  There are several significant features of the Buddhist revival movement:

  establishment of Pirivenas
  establishment of presses and using printed material
  conducting debates
  establishment of Buddhist schools
  taking steps to protect the local culture

Establishment of Pirivenas

Establishment of a number of new Pirivenas led by several scholarly Buddhist 
monks was one of the most significant measures taken during the Buddhist revival 
movement. The Pirivenas thus established produced many scholars who had gained 
a  thorough  knowledge  of  languages  such  as  Sinhala,  Pali  and  Sanskrit  and  their 
contribution to the Buddhist revival movement was great.

Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thero.

Hikkaduwe  Sri  Sumangala  Thero  was 
born  in  1827  in  Hikkaduwa  in  the 
Galle  District  and  became  a  Buddhist 
monk  in  1840.  Sri  Sumangala  Thero 
received  education  under  Walane 
Sri  Siddhartha  Thero  and  became  an 
eminent scholar in the country of that 
time.    Establishment  of  Vidyodaya 
Pirivena  in  Maligakanda  in  1873  was 
an  outstanding  service  done  by  Sri 
Sumangala  Thero  who  also  acted  as 
an  influential  leader  in  the  Buddhist 
revival  movement  that  was  launched 
towards  the  end  of  the  19th  century. 
Moreover,  the  Thero  also  wrote  many 
books such as Sidath Sangara Sannaya 
and Kavyasekara Sannaya. The service rendered by Sri Sumangala Thero towards 
the improvement of education of this country in the late 19th century is invaluable.

Establishment of Presses and using Printed Media

By  the  beginning  of  the  19th  century,  there  had  established  by  Missionary 
organizations a number of presses in this country, but Buddhists did not have any 
press. Therefore, Bulathgama Dharmalankara Siri Sumanathissa Thero raised funds 
enduring great hardships and established a press for the Buddhists. This press was 
established in Galle in 1862 and was named Lankopakara Press. Later, many other 
presses were established by Buddhists. 

  After  the  establishment  of  these  presses,  the  Buddhists  were  able  to  publish 
newspapers, periodicals, and various other publications. The titles of some of those 
publications are as follows:

Lakmini Pahana    
Sinhala Jathiya     

Sarasavi Sandaresa    
Sinhala Bauddhaya

Figure 3.2 - The old printing machine preserved in Ranwella Purana Vihara, 
Kathaluwa  and  the  illustration  appeared  in  the  first  page  of  "  Sarasavi 
Sandaresa"

These  newspapers,  periodicals  and  other  publications  issued  by  Buddhists  as  if 
in  competition  with  the  missionaries  resulted  in  stimulating  an  interest  among 
Buddhists and those publications were also useful in responding to criticism leveled 
by missionaries. 

Conducting Debates

In addition to the use of printed media as described above, some Bhikkus went 
on to conduct public debates with the missionary priests. Migettuwatte Gunananda 
Thero  led  these  debates.  The  scholars  such  as  Hikkaduwe  Sri  Sumangala  Thero, 
Waskaduwe Subuthi Thero and Ratmalane Dharmaloka Thero also supported these 
debates. Five of these public debates that were held in five locations in Lanka became 
famous as The Five Great Debates. A large number of people had gathered at these 
locations  with  intense  interest  to  listen  to  these  debates.  The  debates  resulted  in 
stimulating a deep interest in the minds of the Buddhists as the Buddhists’ party 
won in the debates.     

 
62

The Five Great Debates

1. Baddegama Debate  – 1865 
3. Udanwita Debate     – 1866 
5. Panadura Debate     – 1873

2. Varagoda Debate – 1865
4. Gampola Debate – 1871

Out of these debates, the debate called panaduraawadaya (Panadura Debate), which 
was held in Panadura area, became famous internationally. After reading a booklet 
that was written about this debate, Henry Steel Olcott and Madam Blavatsky, who 
were Americans, got highly influenced and came to Lanka. 

Migettuwatte Gunananda Thero

Migettuwatte Gunananda Thero was born in a village 
called Migettuwatta close to Balapitiya in the South. 
Gunananda  Thero  rendered  an  invaluable  service 
towards promotion of Buddhism during the period 
of religious and national revival in Lanka. Holding 
public debates on Buddhism with missionary priests 
was  a  great  service  done  by  Gunananda  Thero. 
Panadura  Debate  that  was  held  in  1873  led  by 
Gunananda  Thero  became  famous  internationally. 
Five  debates  that  were  held  by  Gunananda  Thero 
have  come  to  be  known  as  Pancha  Maha  Vaadaya 
(The  Five  Great  Debates).  Further,  Migettuwaththe  
Gunananda  Thero  rendered  a  valuable  service  in 
the  establishment  of  Parama  Vignanaratha  Society 
(Buddhist  Theosophical  Society)  in  Colombo  and 
also in the movement to establish Buddhist schools.

Establishment of Buddhist Schools

In  1880  AD,  Henry  Steel  Olcott  and  Madam    Helena  Blavatsky,  who  were 
American nationals, arrived in Lanka and embraced Buddhism. Under the guidance 
of  Henry  Steel  Olcott,  an  organization  named  Parama  Vignanartha  Society  was 
established in this country and it became an organization in which both Bikkhus 
and laymen could work together in collaboration.    

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
63

Until  this  time,  Buddhists  had  not  had  the  capacity  to  establish  and  maintain 
Buddhist schools mainly due to lack of funds and lack of necessary organizational 
skills. Henry Steel Olcott acted as a pioneer in establishing Buddhist schools in this 
country. 

A number of Bhikkus and lay men, too, actively supported in this course. Some of 
those who contributed immensely in establishing Buddhist schools are as follows:

-  Migettuwatte Gunananda Thero
-  Ratmalane Dhammaloka Thero
-  Anagarika Dharmapala

As  a  result  of  the  launch  of  the  movement  to  establish  Buddhist  schools  in  this 
country with the revival in Buddhism, a number of Buddhist schools were established 
in main cities of the country with the intervention of Parama Vignanartha Society 
(Buddhist Theosophical Society). Some of those schools include the following:

  Ananda Vidyalaya in Colombo
  Dharmaraja Vidyalaya in Kandy
  Mahinda Vidyalaya in Galle
  Anuruddha Vidyalaya in Nawalapitiya
  Musaeus College in Colombo

64

With the establishment of Buddhist schools, measures were also taken to print new 
school textbooks and to distribute them among children, and also to teach English 
language  to  children.  Commencement  of  Dhamma  Schools  on  Sundays,  making 
Vesak Full Moon Day a public holiday, and creation of Buddhist flag, too, are some 
of the significant events of the Buddhist revival movement. 

Colonel Henry Steel Olcott

Colonel  Henry  Steel  Olcott  was  born  on  02 
August  1832  in  the  State  of  New  Jersey  in 
America. He received his primary education 
at a school in New York and later he entered 
Colombia  University  and  obtained  a  degree. 
Then  Henry  Olcott  joined  the  Navy  of 
America  and  worked  in  the  capacity  of  a 
Colonel. Later, he pioneered the establishment 
of Parama Vignanartha Society together with 
Helena Blavatsky in order to carry out social 
service  work  in  New  York.  When  he  read  a 
booklet  on  Panadura  Debate,  he  was  highly 
influenced  by  the  content  of  that  booklet 
and  then  exchanged  letters  with  Hikkaduwe 
Sumangala  Thero 
and  Migettuwaththe 
Gunananda  Thero.  Consequently,  he  arrived 
in Lanka in 1880.

Taking Steps to protect the Local Culture

  The Buddhist chiefs including Anagarika Dharmapala were concerned about the 
unfortunate situation that had been created due to the challenges that the local culture 
had  faced  during  the  rule  of  the  British.  Therefore,  these  chiefs  acted  with  great 
commitment to educate people on the value of the local culture fostering patriotic 
pride.  In  addition  to  Anagarika  Dharmapala,  many  others  such  as  Walisinghe 
Harischandra,  Piyadasa  Sirisena  and  John  De  Silva  were  among  the  outstanding 
leaders who took steps to educate people on the value of the local culture. 

Sir  D.B.  Jayatilake  pioneered  the  establishment  of  Young  Men’s  Buddhist 
Association  in  Colombo  and  thereby  took  steps  to  inculcate  in  the  minds  of  the 
youth  a  feeling  of  patriotic  pride.  Apart  from  that,  the  Bhikkus  and  other  elites 
started  a  temperance  movement  against  establishment  liquor  shops  throughout 
the country by  the English  government  and  that  contributed  immensely  towards 
preventing people from taking to drinking.   

  Moreover,  another  movement  was  launched  to  restore  the  stupas  and  statues 
that  had  fallen  into  ruin  throughout  the  country  and  to  develop  them.  Further, 
Walisinghe  Harischandra  initiated  a  movement  to  protect  the  Buddhist  sacred 
places  in  Anuradhapura  that  had  fallen  to  ruin.  Anagarika  Dharmapala  went  to 
India  and  took  steps  to  protect  the  Buddhist  sacred  places  in  India.  Meanwhile, 
eminent playwrights such as John De Silva wrote plays based on themes related to 
History and Buddhism, and staged them. Writers such as Piyadasa Sirisena wrote 
fictions and they also wrote to newspapers highlighting the value of the local culture. 

Anagarika Dharmapala

66

  Anagarika Dharmapala was born in Colombo in 1864 . His name was Don David 
Hewavitharana, and later he adopted the name Anagarika Dharmapala. He received 
primary education at St. Thomas’ College and secondary education at St. Benedict’s 
College and Royal College in Colombo. 

He  then  went  on  to  study  Pali  and  also  the  thripitaka  from  Hikkaduwe  Sri 
Sumangala Thero and from other Buddhist monks. Later he joined the Buddhist 
Parama  Vignanartha  Society  and  adopted  a  new  name  as  Dharmapala.  He  spent 
a  homeless  life  and  acted  with  deep  commitment  for  Buddhism.  He  enlightened 
the Lankans on the value of protecting their language, culture and the traditional 
heritage. Towards the end of his life, when he lived in India, he became a Buddhist 
monk adopting the name Siri Devamiththa. In 1933, Siri Devamiththa Thero passed 
away at Saranath in India.

3.3   Hindu Revival Movement

The Hindus, too, were affected by the activities of the missionary organizations in this 
country. Hinduism was faced with serious challenges as the missionary movement 
was spreading very strongly, particularly in the Jaffna District. There arose a religious 
and  cultural  revival  among  the  Hindus  because  of  the  measures  implemented  in 
response by the Hindu religious leaders. Establishment of presses, educating people 
through printed material and public lectures, and establishing schools for Hindu 
children were the significant features of the Hindu revival movement. It was Arumuga 
Navalar  who  led  the  Hindu  revival  movement.  Arumuga  Navalar  first  started  a 
newspaper  entitled  “Udayabhanu”  in  order  to  educate  Tamil  people  on  the  value 
of the Hindu religion and culture. In order to provide religious education to Hindu 

 
 
67

children, he launched a movement to establish Hindu schools which commenced 
with the establishment of “Saiva Prakasha” Vidyalaya in Vannarpannai. Even after 
the  death  of  Arumuga  Navalar,  leaders  such  as  Ponnambalam  Arunachalam  and 
Ponnambalam Ramanathan continued with the movement to establish Hindu 
schools.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Arumuga  Navalar

  Arumuga Navalar was born in 1822 
AD and received primary education at a 
missionary school. Later he served under 
a  clergyman  of  the  Methodist  Church. 
For this very reason, he had a very good 
understanding about the activities of the 
missionaries.  Arumuga  Navalar  often 
emphasized  the  need  for  establishing 
Hindu  schools  and  establishing  a  press 
in  order  to  publish  reading  material 
for  Hindu  children  to  educate  them 
on  Hindu  religion  and  also  to  teach 
them practices and rituals of the Hindu 
religion.  Accordingly,  with  the  support 
of donors, Arumuga Navalar established 
in Jaffna a Hindu school named Saiva Prakasha Vidyasalai. Because of the experience 
he had gained at missionary schools, he was able to prepare the curriculum for these 
schools  to  suit  the  need  of  the  time.  Later  on,  a  number  of  Hindu  schools  were 
established  throughout  the  Jaffna  District,  but  those  established  by  Navalar  were 
the leading ones among them. Saiva administrative council and Hindu education 
council were established, and steps were taken to establish Hindu schools through 
those councils. In order to teach English to Tamil children, Shivangala Vidyalaya 
was established in Jaffna in 1872. Later it became famous as Hindu College in Jaffna. 
Arumuga  Navalar  who  rendered  a  valuable  service  to  the  Tamil  community  as 
described above, passed away in 1879.

Services done by Arumuga Navalar to the Nation

  giving leadership to the Hindu revival movement in Sri Lanka
  pioneering the establishment of Hindu Schools
  taking steps to protect the language, literature and culture of the Hindus
  writing the textbook series titled ‘Bala Patham’ and translating into Tamil

Ponnambalam Ramanathan

Ponnambalam Ramanathan was born in 1851 and 
received  school  education  from  Royal  College, 
Colombo.  Later  he  worked  as  an  attorney-
at-law.  He  was  a  great  leader  who  donated 
money  generously  to  establish  schools  in 
order to develop the education of the Hindu 
children.  Ponnambalam  Ramanathan 
established schools such as Parameshvara 
Vidyalaya and Ramanathan Vidyalaya and 
worked  for  the  progress  of  the  education 
of Hindu children.

In  1879,  Ponnambalam  Ramanathan  was 
selected  as  a  Member  of  the  Legislative 
Council. In terms of Crewe-McCallum reforms, 
he  was  elected  as  the  first  educated  Lankan 
Member in 1912.

At  the  same  time  as  Buddhist  and  Hindu  revival 
movements were launched, there also erupted an Islamic 
revival  movement.  The  Islamic  revival  movement  of  this 
country was led by M.C. Siddhi Lebbe who was a lawyer by 
profession. Urabi Pasha, who was exiled from Egypt by the 
English,  arrived  in  Lanka  in  1883  and  supported  Siddhi 
Lebbe in the Islamic revival movement. In order to educate 
the  Muslim  community  through  printed  media,  Siddhi 
Lebbe started publishing a magazine titled Muslim Nesan. 
Siddhi Lebbe also took steps to provide Muslim children 
with education that was in compliance with the teachings 
of Islam by way of establishing schools such as Zahira College in Colombo. After 
Siddhi  Lebbe,  leaders  such  as  T.B.  Jaya  worked  with  great  commitment  for  the 
development of education of Muslim children.

T.B. Jaya

T.B.  Jaya  was  born  in  January  1890  in  Galagedara. 
After completing his school education, he worked as a 
teacher at a number of schools such as Prince of Wales 
College and Ananda Vidyalaya. Sharing the experience 
he had gained in the education sector, he contributed 
immensely towards the movement for establishing and 
developing  Muslim  schools.  He  also  wrote  articles  to 
the  magazine  titled  Ceylon  Muslim  Review.  Later  he 

became the principal of Zahira College in Colombo and went on to establish 
branches of Zahira College in many parts of the country. Also, T.B. Jaya acted 
as a Representative in the Legislative and, joining hands with the Sinhala and 
Tamil leaders, worked for promoting national unity.

Introduction

Arrival of the Portuguese national Vasco da Gama and his team in India 
in 1498 in search of countries during the exploration age was a significant event 
in the political history of Asia. After Vasco da Gama, the Portuguese, the Dutch, 
the  English  and  the  French  arrived  in  India  from  time  to  time  and  established 
their  power  in  the  coastal  areas  of  India.  However,  of  all  those  Europeans,  it 
was only the English that were able to establish a stable political power in India. 
By  adopting  various  strategies,  the  English  spread  their  power  throughout  the 
entire country and made India a colony of the British Empire. Towards the end 
of  the  19th  century,  a  national  independence  movement  was  launched  against 
the rule of the British in India and, by the beginning of the following century, it 
had developed into a very strong patriotic movement. An outstanding feature of 
the independence movement  of  India  was that all  Indians,  who  spoke  different 
languages and who belonged to various ethnic groups, got united and rose with 
extreme patriotism against the British to win independence for their motherland. 
Because of such features, the independence movement in India was an example to 
the other British colonies in Asia. The impact of the Europeans on India, spread of 
power in India by the English, the nature of the independence movement of India 
and the outstanding leaders who led that movement are discussed in this lesson. 

 
72

4.1 The Impact of the Europeans on India

After the arrival of the Portuguese in India, the trade activities that had so far 
been carried out by the Arabs around the Indian Ocean severely declined. After the 
Portuguese, the Dutch, the English and the French arrived in India and then there 
arose  disputes  among  those  groups  themselves  on  trade  activities  and  spread  of 
political power in India. Even by that time, several European nations had established 
warehouses and fortresses along the coastal areas of India and therefore the conflicts 
that erupted between those groups had an impact on India, too. At the early period 
after the arrival of the European nations in India, their main intentions were to earn 
profits through trade and to spread religion; however, with the eruption of conflicts 
between themselves, they took an intense interest in spreading political power in 
India. In the process of spreading political power in India, the English were doing 
well ahead of the other nations. As a result, India became a colony of the British 
Empire.

Arrival of the Portuguese, the Dutch, the English and the French in India

By  the  time  Vasco  da  Gama  arrived  in  India,  there  was  no  political  unity  in  the 
country. Apart from the Vijaya Nagar State in the South, there were a number of 
independent kingdoms in various parts of the country. Further, there were several 
small kingdoms such as Calicut and Goa along the coastal parts of India. Lack of 
unity among these kingdoms paved the way for the English to establish their power 
in several parts along the coast.

Alfonzo de Albuquerque, who was appointed the Portuguese Viceroy in the East in 
1509, contributed a lot towards the establishment of Portuguese power in India and 
in the Indian Ocean region. He captured Goa in 1510 and not only made Goa the 
Eastern Center of the Portuguese, but went on to establish Portuguese trade power 
around the Indian Ocean, too. During the later period, the Portuguese spread their 
power to many areas in India, but they did not succeed in going beyond the coastal 
areas into the country to establish their power in areas inside the country. However, 
they made Goa their Centre and maintained trade monopoly in the Indian Ocean 
for over a century.   

 
73

It was from the Dutch that a threat was posed to the Portuguese power in the coastal 
areas of India for the first time. The Dutch Established the East India Company 
(VOC) in 1602 and took steps to send to the Indian Ocean a powerful fleet of ships. 
With  the  arrival  of  the  Dutch,  there  erupted  conflicts  between  the  Portuguese 
and the Dutch regarding trade and spreading of political power. The Dutch first 
directed their attention towards the southeastern countries where spices grew in 
abundance. After driving the Portuguese from the islands where spices grew, the 
Dutch then turned towards India. In the same way as Albuquerque implemented 
measures  to  spread  Portuguese  power,  the  Dutch  national  Pieterszoon  Coen 
took steps to spread the Dutch power in Asia. Consequently, Dutch power was 
established in areas such as Gujarat, Bengal, Orissa, and Bihar in India. 

The  English,  whose  motherland  is  Britain,  established  the  British  East  India 
Company  and  arrived  in  Asia  in  the  early  part  of  the  17th  century.  Initially,  the 
English  directed  their  attention  towards  countries  such  as  Java  and  Sumatra,  but 
when conflicts erupted with the Dutch, they began to turn towards India, too. At 
the time the English reached India, the Mogul Empire in India was very powerful. 
Therefore, after obtaining permission from the Mogul Emperor Jahangir, the English 
established  a  warehouse  in  Surat  in  1613.  With  the  passage  of  time,  the  English, 
however, succeeded in establishing their power in many areas such as Ahmadabad, 
Agra,  and  Madras  in  India.  When  King  Charles  II  of  England  married  Princess 
Catherine of Portugal, the Portuguese handed over to the English as dowry, the area 
of Bombay which had been under Portuguese rule. 

It  was  after  the  other  European  nations  that  the  French  directed  their  attention 
towards  India.  The  French  who  established  Eastern  French  Company  in  1664 
arrived in India in 1668 and built a warehouse in Surat. Later, they built fortresses in 
many areas such as Pondicherry, Karaikal and Chandranagar in India.

74

   The Mogul Empire

 It was a ruler named Babur 
who 
laid  the  foundation 
for  the  Mogul  Empire.  In 
1526,  he  captured  many 
areas  in  the  north  of  India 
and  established  a  separate 
rule  in  those  areas.  King 
Akbar  the  Great,  who  was 
a  grandson  of  Babur’s, 
expanded  Mogul  power  to 
the  status  of  an  empire.  He 
ruled the empire during the period from 1556 to 1605 and spread his power in a large 
part of the north of India. Emperors Jahangir and Sha Jahan, who came to power after 
Akbar were outstanding emperors, too. King Sha Jahan was the creator of the world 
famous construction the ‘Taj Mahal’. However, during the rule of Aurangzeb who came 
to power after Sha Jehan, the Mogul empire began to suffer its downfall.       

Map 4.1 Distribution of European Power in India

India becoming a Colony of the British Empire

The English and the French were two nations that often came into conflict in Europe. 
Therefore, arrival of the French in India was a threat to the power of the English in 
India.  By  the  mid  18th  century,  the  power  of  the  Portuguese  and  the  Dutch  had 
declined.  Therefore,  establishing  power  in  the  inland  of  India  became  a  conflict 
between the English and the French. 

After  the  death  of  India’s  last  Mogul  emperor,  Aurangzeb,  in  1707,  the  powerful 
Mogul empire that had spread its power in a large part of India started to suffer its 
downfall. As a result, various ethnic groups in India that had been tolerating the 
rule of the Mogul empire established independent states resulting in the creation of 
a number of regional kingdoms in India. Lack of unity between these small king-
doms was very advantageous for the English. The naval power the English possessed 
and the support the British East India Company received from the government of 
England were very useful for the English in India in fighting against the French.  

In this way, the English, based in Madras, and the French, based in Pondicherry, fought 
against each other in order to establish power in the coastal parts of India. It was 
only after the capture of Pondicherry by the English that the battles between the 
English and the French came to an end. With this defeat, the power of the French in 
India became very weak.

Establishment of the power of the English in the inland parts of India began from 
Bengal. The English, who took advantage of the disunity and dissents that existed 
between Bengal and its surrounding areas, 
succeeded in bringing Bengal under the rule 
of British East India Company towards the 
end of 18th century. The English governors 
who were appointed to India after that went 
on to expand their power in the inland parts 
of  India  by  way  of  war  and  by  adopting 
various other strategies as well. In addition 
to  expanding  their  power  through  wars, 
adoption  of  strategic  policies  such  as 
subsidiary  agreements  and  bona  vacantia 
theory, was significant.

Under  the  subsidiary  agreement  strategy, 
the British East India Company entered into 
agreements  with  native  leaders  who  were 
engaged  in  internal  disputes  or  those  who 

Figure 4.1 – A troop of Sepoy soldiers

76

were faced with threats from enemies outside and deployed the English army for 
the security of those kingdoms. In terms of the agreements, if the kingdoms which 
obtained the services of the English army failed to pay to the Company the charges 
for obtaining such security services, a part of those kingdoms had to be given to 
the Company. Through this strategy, the English were able to capture many parts of 
India including Hyderabad and Mysore.

According to bona vacantia theory, the kingdoms of which there was no rightful 
heir to the throne from the royal lineage after the death of the king were considered 
to  be  belonging  to  the  English  company.  The  English  in  this  manner  established 
their power in a number of small kingdoms such as Jaipur and Nagpur. In this way, 
towards the middle of the 19th century, the English succeeded in capturing the entire 
India through their war power and by adopting various other strategies.

4.2  Sepoy Rebellion of 1857

Map 4.2- Areas where Sepoy Rebellion spread

77

The  Indians  who  were  enlisted  in  the  army  under  the  English  were  called  Sepoy 
soldiers. As India is a very large country, the English army alone was not sufficient 
to provide security to the country. Therefore the English enlisted to their army as 
many Indians as three times the number of English soldiers that had been brought 
to India. 

Most of the Indians in the Sepoy army were Hindus and Muslims. In 1857, these 
Sepoy soldiers launched a massive rebellion against the rule of the English. It was 
called the Sepoy rebellion.

From the very beginning the Indians did not like the rule of the British East India 
Company in India. Therefore, there erupted from time to time in India rebellions 
against the rule of the British East India Company. During the period from 1763 to 
1856, there erupted over twenty five of such rebellions. 

The English crushed such rebellions that erupted in various parts of India from time 
to time before they further expanded to other parts. However, the rebellion that was 
launched by the Sepoy soldiers in 1857 was not limited to the army, it expanded 
outside the army and spread among the general public. 

The English had to strive hard to suppress that rebellion. In some areas, the Sepoy 
soldiers  joined  civilians  and  drove  away  the  English  from  those  areas,  and  they 
tried to establish a rule by the natives. Because of these reasons, the 1857 rebellion 
stimulated feelings of independence in the minds of the Indians and therefore it is 
considered to be a landmark event in the history of the independence movement 
of  India.  There  were  a  number  of  factors  that  caused  the  eruption  of  the  Sepoy 
rebellion:

Figure 4.2 – A painting of the Sepoy rebellion

78

Reasons that led to 1857 Rebellion:

 ² The  strong  dissension  that  Indians  had  against  the  policy  that  the  English  had 

adopted in capturing the areas in India

 ² The disappointment that the Indians felt against the rule that was carried out by 

the English for the benefit of the English

 ² Crippling of local industries and loss of job opportunities because of the economic 

policies adopted by the British Company

 ² Patronage given by the English government to spread Christianity neglecting the 

rituals and beliefs of the native people

 ² The disappointment felt by Sepoy soldiers towards the English

The  immediate  cause  for  the  Sepoy  rebellion  was  created  from  within  the  army 
itself. The English introduced a new type of rifle called Enfield rifles for the use of 
the Sepoy army. The cartridges used for such rifles came in a packing which had 
to  be  broken  open  with  the  teeth  in  order  to  take  the  cartridges  out.  A  rumour 
spread  among  Sepoy  soldiers  that  beef  tallow  or  lard  (pork  fat  tallow)  had  been 
applied on those cartridges. Hindus considered the cow to be a sacred animal while 
the Muslims considered the pig to be an unclean animal. Sepoy soldiers believed it 
to be degrading treatment by the English to make them break open such fat smeared 
packaging with the mouth. Therefore Sepoy soldiers refused to use this new type 
of rifle. As English officers imposed penalties on Sepoy soldiers who refused to use 
those rifles, the conflict between the English and Sepoy soldiers escalated. That was 
the  immediate  cause  of  the  Sepoy  rebellion.  Meanwhile,  a  Sepoy  soldier  named 
Mangal Pandey shot an English military officer. As the English imposed penalty on 
Mangal Pandey, the disappointment of the Sepoy soldiers seemed to have further 
intensified.  Consequently,  on  10th  May  1857,  the  Sepoy  soldiers  in  the  Meerut 
military camp shot the English military officers, kept them in confinement, freed 
the other Indian soldiers and launched the rebellion.

Sepoy soldiers who rose against the English army broke into the City of Delhi and 
soon captured the Delhi City. This resulted in the rebellion, which had been within 
the army, spread among the civilians, as well. The rebels rose against the English 
rule and declared Bahadur Shah, who was a Mogul ruler in Delhi, as the Emperor 
of  India.  The  news  of  this  political  revolt  in  Delhi  spread  throughout  India  and 

79

the rebellion spread to many of the areas 
in the north of India. Rulers in those areas 
who were native Indians joined the rebels 
and  took  to  fighting  against  the  English 
rule  causing  the  English  to  suffer  severe 
hardships. In this way, many of the areas 
in the north of India were under the rule 
of the rebels for nearly a year.

It  was  considered  degrading  for  the 
English to lose a city like Delhi. Therefore 
the  English  army  fought  with  all  their 
might and recaptured the city of Delhi. In 
this battle the rebels suffered heavy losses. 
Ultimately  the  English  succeeded 
in 
suppressing the rebellions that had started 
in  each  of  the  areas  that  the  English  had 
lost and finally they managed to bring all 
those areas under their rule. In this way, the rebellion failed and, by July 1858, the 
English had once again established their rule in all areas in the North of India.  

Figure 4.3 – Mangal Pandey

Reasons that led to the Failure of the Rebellion

Although the rebellion spread very fast because of the general disappointment that 
the Indians felt against the English, the rebels failed to continue to safeguard the 
areas they had captured from the English. The rebels neither had a vision required 
for establishing a stable administration in the areas they captured nor did they have 
a long-term plan for establishing their rule in those areas. Except for the firearms the 
rebels had plundered from the armouries belonging to the English, the rebels did 
not have any means of providing the required weaponry either. For these reasons, 
the rebels had to fight against the English under very difficult circumstances. The 
facts that nearly one half of the Indian soldiers continued to support the English 
army and that some of the citizens did not join the rebellion also contributed to the 
suppression of the rebellion by the English. The Indians who joined the rebellion 
did not lack fighting spirit, commitment to fight and dissension against the English, 
but the attacks the English launched could be resisted only because of the courage 
the  Indians  had.  Thus  the  reasons  that  led  to  the  failure  of  the  rebellion  can  be 
summarized as follows:

80

 ² lack of a general plan or a future plan for the rebels
 ² not having a central leadership
 ² lack of weaponry to resist the attacks of the English army
 ² poor exchange of messages and communication among rebels
 ² support of some of the Indians being given to the English

The Impact of the Rebellion

Although the 1857 rebellion became a failure, it resulted in a number of positive 
impacts which were crucial for the future of India. Some of them are as follows:

 ² The  rule  of  the  British  East  India  Company  was  put  to  an  end  and  the 
responsibility of governing India was taken over by the British government
 ² Britain agreeing not to capture areas in India any further and to recognize the 

rights of the Maharajas

 ² Granting religious freedom to Indians
 ² Indians beginning to manage the independence movement in a more organized 

manner

4.3 Significant Features of India’s Independence Movement  

The Background to the Establishment of National Association

The period of about half a century after the failure of Sepoy rebellion was a period 
during which feelings of nationalism were stimulated in the minds of all Indians 
dominating  different  aspirations  that  were  unique  to  each  community.  There 
seemed to have been great interest in protecting the traditional local cultures from 
the influence of the western culture that spread in India during that time under the 
rule of the English. It is also seen that a number of organizations were established 
during this period with the objective of bringing about religious and social reforms. 
On the one hand, it took the form of a religious and cultural revival that sparked in 
India.

The eminent scholar Ram Mohan Roy, who had mastered western languages as well 
as the eastern languages, laid the foundation for a religious revival from the very 

81

beginning of the 19th century. The organization named Brahmo Samaj, which was 
established by Ram Mohan Roy, paved the way for a religious and cultural revival 
among the Hindus. Therefore he is considered to be the pioneer of the Hindu revival 
movement. Further, organizations such as Prarthana Samaj and Arya Samaj were 
prominent among the organizations that worked towards bringing about the Hindu 
religious and cultural revival. In addition to them, organizations such as Ahmadiyya 
movement and Aligarh movement contributed towards bringing about a cultural 
revival among the Muslims while organizations such as Singh Sabha brought about a 
cultural revival among the Sikhs. These organizations functioned in a humanitarian 
manner  and,  towards  the  end  of  the  19th  century,  they  were  actively  engaged  in 
working towards shaping the thinking of the Indians to suit the time. During the 
rule of the British, the highway system and communication in India were developed 
and  as  a  result  the  entire  country  was  administratively  combined.  This  situation 
contributed  immensely  towards  creating  an  Indian  nationalism  dominating  the 
identities  of  different  communities  such  as  Hindus,  Muslims,  Bengalese,  and 
Punjabis, that had existed up to that time.   During the period of the religious revival, 
steps  were  taken  to  raise  awareness  among  people  by  way  of  assembling  people 
belonging  to  various  ethnic  communities  and  addressing  them  and  also  through 
printed media including newspapers. This also resulted in a revival in the field of 
education in line with the religious revival. At this time there was a great interest in 
establishing new schools in India, giving education to women and improving the 
education of women.

Because  of  the  opportunities  for  education  that  were  created  in  India  during  the 
rule of the British, some Indians went to Europe and received their education there. 
Through these opportunities, the educated Indians gained understanding about the 
western attitudes towards freedom, democracy and human rights etc. The educated 
Indians, who received education from countries such as England and France, highly 
valued the freedom  enjoyed  by the  people  in European countries. However,  they 
were disappointed that people in their motherland had lost their freedom because of 
the rule of the English in India. However higher the education the Indians received 
was, up to that time, the English had not given the opportunity for Indians at least 
to enter the civil service of India. For this reason, the educated people of India came 
forward to organize people and to form various organizations with the objective of 
working towards winning their rights. As discussed above, by the beginning of the 
20th  century,  a  number  of  factors  that  contributed  towards  stimulating  patriotic 
feelings were identified.

82

Factors that resulted in stimulating Patriotic Feelings among Indians
 ² India getting politically united under the rule of the British, and evoking the 
feeling of unity among Indians because of the development of Highways and 
communication

 ² Looking down on Indians by the English
 ² Knowledge  that  existed  in  Western  countries  on  freedom,  equality  and 
democracy being transferred to India through the scholars who received their 
education in western countries

 ²    Taking steps by the educated middle class in India to stimulate patriotic feelings 
in the minds of people by way of establishing various organizations and using 
mass media 

Establishment of Indian National Association

By  the  end  of  the  19th  century,  a  number  of  political  organizations  of  various 
types  had  been  established  by  the  educated  people  and  the  business  community 
in  India  because  of  the  political  consideration  they  had.  However,  none  of  these 
organizations had the capacity to carry out their political activities throughout the 
entire country because India was such a large country, and they did not have the 
ability  to  bring  the  political  views  of  all  the  scholars,  who  lived  in  various  parts 
of  the  country,  on  to  one  platform  either. 
Under these circumstances, there had arisen 
the  strong  need  for  creating  one  powerful 
organization  which  was  capable  of  carrying 
out  political  activities  throughout  the  entire 
country  and  of  which  all  Indians  could  get 
membership without any differences.   

Figure 4.4 – Allan Octavian Hume

83

Figure 4.5 – The first meeting of the Indian National Association

By  year  1885,  the  mutual  understanding  and  the  solidarity  that  were  required 
for  forming  a  national  association  among  the  educated  people  in  India  could  be 
developed. Accordingly, Allan Octavian Hume, who was a retired officer of the civil 
service of India, implemented necessary measures to form such an organization in 
which the entire country was represented. Hume, who was the founder of the Indian 
National Association, was given the necessary support by the English government 
as well. The English thought that, if all the scholars in India were brought together 
into  one  association,  the  government  could  easily  learn  the  opinion  of  those 
scholars.  Accordingly,  under  the  guidance  of  Hume,  a  number  of  representatives 
who  represented  various  organizations  that  existed  in  India  gathered  in  Bombay 
in December 1885 and formed the Indian National Association. It was a landmark 
event  in  the  history  of  the  independece  movement  of  India.  W.C.  Banerji,  who 
was a Bengali national, was appointed as the first President of the Indian National 
Association.  Thereafter,  it  became  the  key  organization  which  led  the  political 
protests in India.      

84

Objectives of Indian National Association

Indian National Association was an organization which functioned disregarding all 
ethnic, religious and caste differences. Although this Association was limited to the 
educated and the business community at the initial stage, it later developed into a 
very  powerful  organization  that  was  spread  throughout  the  entire  India  and  was 
well represented by all groups of people. Moreover, Indian National Association was 
the organization that led all activities of India’s independence struggle movement 
from 1885 to 1947 until India won independence. The objectives of this Association, 
which led political protest campaigns for over six decades, broadened from time to 
time. Towards the final stage, the key objective of this organization was to win full 
independence  for  India.  At  the  initial  period  after  the  National  Association  had 
been formed, the objectives of the Association had not been as developed as to that 
of working towards winning full freedom. 

The main objectives of the Indian National Association at the initial stage were as 
follows:
 ² working towards promoting solidarity and cooperation among all Indians
 ² working towards stimulating patriotic feelings in all Indians irrespective of their 

caste, creed, ethnicity and areas they lived in

 ² taking  measures  to  collect  views  and  proposals  that  the  educated  Indians 
possessed and also to study the social issues that prevailed in Indian society 
 ² presentation  of  proposals  and  ideas  for  future  plans  required  for  working 

towards the wellbeing of the Indians    

Functioning of Indian National Association

At the initial stage, the Indian National Association was limited to the educated people 
such as lawyers, engineers and doctors. The representatives of the Association were 
not those who came from the village; they came from urban areas. Expecting that 
the English rulers would do justice to India and be fair to all Indians, these educated 
people tried as far as possible to be cooperative with the English government. They 
were called the moderates in the Association. W.C. Benerji, the first president of the 
Indian National Association, Dadabhai Naoroji, who became the second president 
of  the  Indian  National  Association,  and  Surendranath  Banerjee  are  examples  for 
some of the moderates. During the period from 1885 to 1905, the Indian National 
Association functioned under the influence of those moderates. The requests that 

85

the Association submitted to the English government at the initial period after the 
establishment of the Association were as follows:

 ² broadening the legislative council and increasing its powers
 ² giving the opportunity for Indians to represent the Executive Council
 ² increasing the number of Indians that were recruited to the civil service of India
 ² holding  the  examinations  for  recruitment  to  the  civil  service  not  only  in 

England, but in India as well

 ² reducing government expenditure on war related activities

As  far  as  the  requests  that  had  been  submitted  to  the  government  by  the  Indian 
National  Association  are  taken  into  consideration,  it  is  clear  that  they  had  been 
focused  on  getting  more  opportunities  for  Indians  to  increase  their  involvement 
in  administrative  affairs.  Also,  they  made  efforts  to  get  the  government  agree  to 
their  demands  by  implementing  measures  such  as  submitting  petitions  to  the 
authorities, having discussions with the authorities, holding meetings, and giving 
publicity to their activities through writings, which did not disturb the activities of 
the  government  or  cause  any  inconvenience  to  the  government,  either.  However, 
when the government did not accommodate their demands, it became clear to the 
members of the Association that such limited activities were not effective in getting 
their demands fulfilled by the government. During the period from 1905 to 1919, 
there was a change in the policies of the Indian National Association and also in 
their activities as well. Such changes seemed to have been caused by the facts that 
the  powers  of  the  moderates  within  the  association  had  weakened  by  that  time 
and  a  group  of  youth  who  were  radicals  had  become  more  powerful  within  the 
Association. These youths rejected the policies of those moderates and, hence, they 
were called extremists. These extremists believed that, rather than being cooperative 
with the government, more aggressive measures would have to be taken against the 
government in order to get their demands fulfilled.

86

Figure 4.6 – Jallianwala Bagh Tragedy

Further,  these  extremists  criticized  the  acts  of  submitting  petitions  to  the 
English government, and sending representatives for discussions, and they considered 
such acts of pleading before authorities as political begging. Therefore, they took 
steps to take the Indian National Association to a more aggressive path. Some of the 
writers who wrote about the freedom struggle of India have stated that it was Lal, 
Bal and Pal who promoted the extremist thinking. Here they referred to the three 
nationalists, Lal Lajpat Rai, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and Bipin Chandra Pal, who led 
the extremist groups.

A campaign was launched to boycott the goods imported from Britain. This campaign 
in which people boycotted using goods produced in Britain and promoted using 
of Indian products was called Swadeshi (domestic) movement. The leaders of the 
Indian National Association took measures to spread throughout the entire India 
the Swadeshi movement that was started in Bengal.

While promoting the use of Indian products, there also was an interest in developing 
local industries. Therefore, the Swadeshi movement also resulted in the development 
of the thinking on economic freedom, too. Getting accustomed to the use of local 

87

products by the Indians contributed immensely towards the development of local 
industries and other businesses in India even after winning independence.

While  the  Independence  movement  was  being  implemented  in  India,  the 
English Introduced several reforms. Morley-Minto reforms of 1909 and Montagu-
Chelmsford  reforms  of  1919  are  examples  for  such  reforms.  Through  these 
constitutional  reforms  participation  of  the  natives  in  the  administration  process 
was gradually increased. However, the Indian National Association was not satisfied 
with those reforms. By year 1920, the key objective of the Association had been to 
win self-rule rather than effecting such minor reforms. Self-rule meant a system of 
government in which India was ruled by Indians themselves while the country still 
remained under the British Empire. On the one hand, it was similar to a Dominion 
status.  Bal  Gangadhar  Tilak  and  Annie  Besant  are  examples  for  leaders  who 
promoted the concept of self-rule.

In  1919,  the  English  government  introduced  a  special  act  called  the  Rowlatt  Act 
and made efforts at restricting the freedom of the Indians. In terms of the Rowlatt 
Act, the government had the powers to imprison any person for a period of up to 
two years without trial at a court of law. The Indian National Association, with the 
support of Mahatma Gandhi, launched a Satyagraha campaign against this law. The 
term  ‘Satyagraha’  is  defined  as  a  means  of  making  the  opponent  understand  the 
reality by showing the power of truth. It is a means of nonviolent protest introduced 
by Mahatma Gandhi. Dissent against the Rowlatt Act was showed throughout the 
country  and  it  resulted  in  the  creation  of  a  strong  public  protest.  Meanwhile,  in 
April 1919, the army shot at a gathering of thousands of Indians who had gathered 
at the town of Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar for a meeting. About 400 Indians were 
killed  in  this  shooting  while  many  other  Indians  were  injured.  This  is  called  the 
‘Jallianwala Bagh tragedy’.      

Around  1920,  antigovernment  feelings  of  the  Indians  heightened  due  to 
several  reasons  such  as  imposing  of  Rowlatt  Act,  Jallianwala  Bagh  tragedy  and 
imposition of martial law in Bengal. Some Indians considered it to be cowardice 
to suffer all sorts of such degrading treatment by the English government without 
acting  against  the  steps  taken  by  the  English  government  to  suppress  the  people 
engaged in the independence movement. In December 1920, the Indian National 
Association,  having  realized  the  political  situation  that  existed  in  the  country 
at  that  time,  made  arrangements  to  launch  a  non-cooperation  movement  –  a 
movement to stop extending their cooperation to the government. By January 1921, 
the  non-cooperation  movement  had  spread  throughout  the  country.  Under  this 

88

movement, Indians gave back to the English government the titles and honorary 
titles the English had awarded to them, boycotted imported goods, boycotted courts 
of law and other government offices, boycotted the Legislative Council, and took 
many  such  measures.  Leaders  such  as  Mahatma  Gandhi  and  C.R.  Das  travelled 
round  the  country  and  got  actively  involved  in  implementing  those  measures. 
The English government was greatly inconvenienced because of such non-violent 
measures implemented by the Indian National Association. Through such struggles, 
the Association could get closer and closer to the ordinary masses. In this way, in the 
struggle for freedom, people throughout India had been rallying round the Indian 
National Association since 1920. Some of the measures implemented by the Indian 
National Association after 1920 are as follows:

 ² launching the non-cooperation movement
 ² launching a Hartal campaign against the Simon Commission that was appointed 
in  1928  to  examine  the  constitutional  reforms  in  India  and  make  necessary 
recommendations

 ² convening an all-party conference with the participation of all political parties 

in India and taking measures to formulate a constitution that suited India

 ² in 1929, making ‘gaining full self-rule status’ or winning independence the key 
objective of the Indian National Association and taking steps to achieve that 
goal

 ² organizing a civil disobedience campaign against the government
 ² by 1942, launching a Satyagraha campaign with the slogan ‘Englishmen, quit 

India’

The  period  from  1920-1947  was  the  most  active  period  of  the  Indian  National 
Association.  During  this  period,  not  only  the  Indian  National  Association,  the 
entire  independence  movement  had  come  under  the  leadership  of  Mahatma 
Gandhi. Under the guidance of Mahatma Gandhi, the Indian National Association 
seemed to have taken to non-violent protest strategies such as holding Satyagraha 
campaigns,  non-cooperation  with  the  government,  holding  protest  marches,  and 
civil  disobedience.  For  these  very  reasons,  it  is  evident  that  the  Association  had 
become closer and closer to the general public of India and was also getting closer 
to their target of winning independence.     

89

Establishment of the Muslim League

When  the  English  governed  their  colonies,  they  adopted  a  policy  of  governing 
countries so that the citizens become divided and are prevented from getting united 
against the rule of the English. The English had realized that, when the majority of 
the people act against the government, the government could obtain the support of 
the minority communities by way of dividing the people of the country based on 
religious and ethnic differences.

The majority of the Indians are Hindus and there also live a considerable number 
of  Muslims.  At  the  early  period  after  the  establishment  of  the  Indian  National 
Association,  the  educated  Hindus  and  the  Muslims  were  faced  with  the  same 
problems and therefore they seemed to have acted in unity within the Association. 
Later, however, when the Association was going ahead with its activities, some of 
the Muslim leaders thought that problems related to the rights of the Muslims are 
not given due consideration as against those of the Hindus. Among the youths who 
later joined the Indian National Association, there also was a group who believed 
that the traditional Hindu morality was spiritually greater than the modern western 
culture. For these reasons, it seems that some of the Muslim leaders had wanted to 
organize themselves separately in order to win the rights of the Muslims. As a result, 
in 1906, All India Muslim Association or the Muslim League was formed under the 
leadership of Aga Khan.

Strategies adopted by the English

In the same way as the English had adopted various strategies when they captured 
India,  they  also  employed  all  possible  strategies  to  cripple  the  independence 
movement of the Indians. The strategy the British used mostly to intimidate Indians 
and  also  to  cripple  the  freedom  struggle  was  to  arrest  people  and  to  imprison 
them.  Therefore,  thousands  of  Indians  were  arrested  including  the  leaders  of  the 
Indian National  Association, too. Outstanding  leaders  of the  Association  such  as 
Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru were arrested from 
time  to  time  and  were  imprisoned.  Such  acts  further  strengthened  the  struggle 
instead of crippling it and protests thus escalated. During the period when Indians 
had  implemented  the  non-cooperation  campaign,  C.R.  Das,  who  was  a  leader  of 
that campaign, was arrested in 1921. At that moment, the youth in Bengal got so 
annoyed that thousands of youths were reported to have come forward demanding 
that they be arrested. Therefore, arresting of people was not successful as a strategy 
of crippling the freedom struggle.

90

Apart from arresting people, the English on various occasions seemed to have used a 
number of other strategies such as disturbing protest campaigns and meetings using 
the police and the military forces, and declaring the martial law. The English rulers 
also  went  on  to  incite  racial  differences  in  order  to  prevent  people  from  getting 
united against the government.  

Partitioning of Bengal in 1905 is an example for such strategies. The English, who 
believed that, if Hindus and Muslims got united and rose against them, it would 
be very disadvantageous for the English, and therefore they encouraged Muslims 
to form a separate association. As a result, the Muslim League was formed in 1906.

Bengal, which was located to the 
northeast of India, had been the 
largest  province  of  India  by  the 
beginning  of  the  20th  century. 
Hindus  as  well  as  Muslims 
and 
several  other  minority 
communities  lived  in  Bengal. 
As  millions  of  people  lived  in 
Bengal, which was very large in 
extent  of  land  area,  the  English 
it 
government  decided 
should be divided into two parts 
in order to make administration 
easier. By this time, activities of 
the  freedom  struggle  of  India 

that 

had  been  well  spread  throughout  the  province  of  Bengal.  Therefore  the  Indians 
had  the  belief  that  the  English  were  trying  to  create  conflicts  between  different 
communities in order to divide Bengal so that the independence movement could 
be  crippled  through  that.  As  a  result,  there  erupted  very  heavy  protests  against 
dividing  Bengal.  However,  the  English  government  did  not  pay  heed  to  such 
protests and finally divided Bengal in 1905.

Another strategy that the English adopted with the view to crippling the independence 
movement was to introduce constitutional reforms. The rulers appointed a number 
of  committees  and,  on  many  occasions,  public  representations  were  obtained  on 
constitutional reforms and discussions were held. However, the leaders of the inde-

 
pendence movement were not satisfied with such constitutional reforms. The Indian 
National Association never changed its stance and never moved away from its target 
of winning self-rule status or a full self-rule. Hence, they went on to organize people 
to achieve their target. Once Bal Ganghadar Tilak said, “Self-rule is my heritage by 
birth, and I will achieve it”. Such statements show how strong the determination of 
Indians was for winning independence.

Activities of Mahatma Gandhi

Figure 4.7 – Mahathma Gandhi addressing a meeting

Mahatma Gandhi was the greatest of the leaders of the independence movement of 
India.  He  worked  paying  no  heed  to  race,  creed,  caste  or  class  and  valued  non-
violence. Further, it was Mahatma Gandhi who turned the freedom struggle of India 
into  a  non-violent  movement.  After  completing  his  education  Mahatma  Gandhi 
became a lawyer and served in South Africa. He returned to his motherland, India, 
in 1915. During the first few years after his return to India, he got involved in solving 
the problems faced by the labourer and farmer communities.

92

Mahatma  Gandhi  intervened  in  addressing  the  grievances  of  the  farmers  who 
cultivated indigo in the District of Champaran in the State of Bihar. The struggle he 
carried out to solve the problems of those farmers was called the Champaran peasant 
movement. Further, the struggle he carried out to provide relief to the people who 
had  been  unable  to  pay  taxes  due  to  the  spread  of  epidemics  and  the  prolonged 
drought in Kheda area in the State of Gujarat was called the Kheda movement. The 
life of Mahatma Gandhi is full of such non-violent struggles. 

4.8 Dandi march

During the period from 1920 – 1947, Mahatma Gandhi acted as the leader of the 
independence  movement  of  India.  With  the  objective  of  winning  independence 
for  India,  Mahatma  Gandhi  implemented  a  number 
of  non-violent  strategies  such  as  carrying  out 
Satyagrahas,  non-cooperation  with  the  government, 
civil  disobedience,  engaging  in  protest  marches,  and 
carrying  out  Upavasas.  These  strategies  were  carried 
out without any bloodshed or any violent activities. Not 
only the rich, but also the poor farmers and labourers 
in India could join these struggles easily.

For  these  reasons,  hundreds  of  thousands  of  Indians, 
without  feeling  any  difference,  joined  the  struggles 
carried  out  by  Mahatma  Gandhi.  Accordingly,  it 
was  Mahatma  Gandhi  who  built  up  the  relationship 
between the Indian National Association and the general public of the country.  

93

How people launched the non-cooperation campaign in 1921 under the leadership 
of Mahatma Gandhi was described above. Taking a further step, a civil disobedience 
campaign was launched under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi in 1930. Although 
salt was produced at a very low cost in India, the government had imposed very 
high taxes on salt and thereby earned huge profits through the sale of salt. Under the 
civil disobedience campaign, Mahatma Gandhi took steps to violate the laws related 
to salt in protest of the government. It was called the Dandi march.   

The march from Sabarmati Ashram to Dandi beach, which was of a distance of about 
400 miles, was started in March, 1930. Thousands of Indians, headed by Mahatma 
Gandhi, took part in this march which showed the Indians that they could obtain salt 
without paying taxes to the English, and, therefore, the march was a great success. 
Such marches were held throughout India. While engaged in the civil disobedience 
campaign, textile and liquor that were imported from Britain were boycotted, too. 
The  English  faced  severe  difficulties  because  of  such  protests.  Consequently,  the 
English took steps to arrest thousands of Indians including Mahatma Gandhi. The 
protests that were launched throughout the country came to an end only after an 
agreement was entered into between Mahatma Gandhi and the Viceroy of India. It 
is called Gandhi-Irwin pact of 1931.

Since  such  non-violent  struggles  that  were  launched  under  the  leadership  of 
Mahatma  Gandhi  with  the  support  of  the  National  Association  were  spread 
throughout  India,  the  English  found  it  difficult  to  suppress  those  struggles  using 
either the police or the army. Moreover, through these struggles, Mahatma Gandhi 
succeeded in getting the aspirations of all Indians centralized on the noble target of 
wining independence.

India becoming Independent

of 

because 

The  English  government  was  greatly 
inconvenienced 
the 
civil disobedience campaign launched by 
the  Indians  in  1930.  Therefore,  several 
rounds  of  round-table  discussions  were 
held between the English government and 
the leaders of the independence movement. 
Thereafter, in 1935, the English introduced 
a new Government of India Act for India. 

94

In  terms  of  the  provisions  of  that  act,  there  established  in  India  a  ruling  system 
that consisted of a federal structure  that  also involved  representatives  of Indians. 
Although  the  National  Association  was  not  in  full  agreement  with  this  system, 
the  National  Association,  as  well  as  the 
Muslim League, contested in the elections 
that were held under this system. At the 
election that was held in 1937, the Indian 
National Association won power in most 
of the states and cabinets of ministers were 
appointed for those states, too. After that 
system of government had been in effect 
for about two years, World War II broke 
out  in  1939.  As  the  English  connected 
India  to  the  war  without  consulting  the 
views of the Indians, the Indian National 
Association  was  strongly  against  the 
measures  taken  by  the  English  and 
therefore, the Ministers who represented 
the Association resigned their positions.

Figure 4.9 – Mohammed Ali Jinnah

As the English needed the support of the 
Indians in the World War, the English gave the pledge to the Indians that they would 
establish a system of ruling in which the powers of internal administration would be 
vested with the Indians after the World War was over. As the National Association 
was opposed to any other system of government that would be established other than 
giving independence to India, protests erupted once again. Since Japan joined the 
war in 1941, the English feared that the Indians would support the Japanese if Japan 
invaded India. Therefore, the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill expressed 
his willingness to consider the request of the Indians and sent Stafford Cripps as 
a  special  envoy  to  India.  As  Indians  were  opposed  to  the  mission  of  the  English 
envoy, it did not yield the expected results. By this time, the Muslim League, under 
the  leadership  of  Mohammed  Ali  Jinnah,  had  launched  a  huge  campaign  for 
establishing a separate country named Pakistan for the Muslim people. The leaders 
of the National Association, under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, had launched 
a  massive  campaign  under  the  slogan  ‘Englishmen,  quit  India’.  In  response  the 
government declared the National Association an illegal organization and arrested 
the leaders of the Association.

World  War  II  ended  in  1945.  At  the  parliamentary  elections  held  in  Britain, 
Churchill’s  party  was  defeated  and  a  Labour  Party  government  came  into  power. 
As far as the period from the beginning of the World War II to the time India was 
given independence is taken into consideration, several significant features of the 
independence movement of India can be noted as follows.

95

 ² the protests that were launched demanding independence for India intensified,
 ² the  British  understood  that  they  could  no  longer  keep  India  as  one  of  their 

colonies,

 ² the British government had discussions with the Indians and made arrangements 

to grant independence to India.

 ² the Muslim league implemented a separate campaign demanding that a separate 

country named Pakistan be established.  

Consequent to the discussions that took place for a long time since 1945 between 
the British authorities and Indian leaders, a temporary government was established 
in India in September 1946. Lord Mountbatten, who acted as the last British Viceroy 
in  India,  expedited  the  process  of  giving  powers  to  Indians.  Accordingly,  on  15 
August  1947,  India  became  an  independent  country  that  is  completely  free  from 
the rule of the British. By the time India was granted independence, it had to be 
divided into two countries as India and Pakistan as a result of the conflicts that had 
escalated between the Hindus and the Muslims. As Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad, 
who  was  a  prominent  leader  of  India’s  independence  movement,  had  stated,  the 
ethnic conflicts that existed between the Hindus and the Muslims did not end. As 
far  as  the  independence  movement  of  India  is  concerned,  it  is  also  evident  that, 
although the British who had established a vast empire succeeded in defeating the 
great dictator of German, Hitler, in the World War II with the support of its allies, 
they failed to defeat the non-violent movement of Gandhi of India.

4.4 Prominent Leaders of India’s Independence Movement      

Dadabhai Naoroji

born 
Dadabhai  Naoroji  was 
in  Mumbai 
in  1825,  and  after 
completing his education he worked 
as  a  professor  of  mathematics  at 
as  a  professor  of  mathematics  at 
Elphinstone  College 
in  Mumbai. 
Later,  he  went  to  London  where  he 
acted with commitment to implement 
measures  to  raise  awareness  among 
people  in  England  on  the  political 
people  in  England  on  the  political 
and  economic  situation  of  India. 
Naoroji  was  a  pioneer  member  of 
Naoroji  was  a  pioneer  member  of 
the Indian National Association and 
became the president of the Association on a few occasions. He 
was a moderate and was particularly interested in the economic 
development  of  India.  Naoroji  is  also  famous  as  a  leader  who 
first  explained  how  India  was  gradually  becoming  a  poor 
country because of the economic policy adopted by the English. 
Naoroji was a great scholar and was one of the oldest members 
of the Independence Movement of India. Hence, he was called 
The Grand Old Man of India.

97

Surendranath Banerjee

Surendranath Banerjee, who was born in 1848 
in Calcutta, was a Bengali national. He obtained 
his first degree from India and went to England 
for higher education where he passed the Civil 
Service  examination  which  was  considered  to 
be  a  very  high  examination.  Thus,  Banerjee 
became the first Indian to join the civil service 
of  India,  but  his  appointment  was  terminated 
shortly  after  being  appointment  to  the  civil 
service.  However,  he  was  not  disappointed  by 
that  and  he  worked  bravely  towards  winning 
the  rights  of  the  Indians.  Banerjee  became 
famous as an educationist and he established a 
new school called Ripon College. Also, he launched a new newspaper titled ‘The 
Bengalee’ and took steps to educate Indians through that.  

In  1876,  Banerjee  established  the  nationalist  organization  which  created  the 
background for the establishment of Indian National Association. Banerjee was 
a neutralist and was an outstanding leader of the Independence Movement. He 
became the president of the Indian National Association on two occasions.

Bal Gangadhar Tilak

Bal  Gangadhar  Tilak  was  born  in 
Maharashtra  in  1856.  He  was  a 
very  clever  student  at  school.  He 
obtained  his  first  degree  with  a 
distinction  pass  for  Mathematics, 
continued  his  higher  education 
and  became  a  scholar.  He  strongly 
believed  that  a  good  education  is 
required for an individual to become a good citizen and therefore, he established 
an  organization  named  Deccan  Education  Society.  He  also  pioneered  the 
establishment of several schools. He dared to criticize the injustices caused to 
the Indians at the hands of the English rulers and also founded two newspapers 
entitled ‘Kesari’ and ‘Maratha’.

98

Bal Gangadhar Tilak, who, having been given the honorary title of ‘Lokamanya’, 
was  called  ‘Lokamanya  Tilak’,  was  one  of  the  outstanding  leaders  of  the 
independence  movement  of  India  who  directed  that  movement  towards  a 
more aggressive path. He said, “Self-rule is my heritage by birth” and he was 
committed towards educating people on winning self-rule for India. 

 Because of his activities, he was imprisoned on several occasions. Lokamanya 
Tilak  believed  that  sending  petitions  to  the  English  government,  holding 
discussions  with  authorities,  and  pleading  with  the  English  rulers  were  not 
effective  ways  of  getting  their  demands  fulfilled.  He  was  of  the  opinion  that, 
in  order  to  win  independence,  all  Indians  should  be  united  and  should  be 
engaged  in  a  continuous  struggle.  Although  he  valued  being  aggressive,  he 
hated violence. Bal Gangadhar Tilak was a great leader of India’s independence 
movement who was as stable as a huge rock before any obstacle. 

Mahatma Gandhi

Mohandas  Karamchand  Gandhi,  who  became 
famous  as  Mahatma  Gandhi,  was  born  in  1869 
and  after  completing  his  school  education  he  left 
for England for higher education. There he passed 
the examinations in Law and went to South Africa 
to work as a lawyer. When he was in South Africa, 
he  understood  how  the  Europeans  who  had  come 
to  South  Africa  had  seized  power  there  and  were 
discriminating the black people very badly adopting 
the  apartheid  policy.  At  that  time,  traveling  on 
certain compartments of trains had been prohibited 
for  black  people.  Even  Mahatma  Gandhi  had  been  removed  while  he  was 
travelling  on  such  a  compartment.  While  Mahatma  Gandhi  was  in  South 
Africa, he took steps to organize people against such injustices. 

Mahatma Gandhi returned to India in 1915 and joined the independence 
movement of India. During the early period after he had returned to India, 
he was involved in finding solutions to the problems faced by the  farmer 

 
99

communities in the country. His involvement in the independence movement 
contributed immensely in getting the participation of the ordinary people in the 
movement. After Mahatma Gandhi had joined the movemnet, he showed the 
people how the struggle could be implemented adopting non-violent strategies 
without causing any violence to the Englishmen or to those who were loyal to 
them. 

 Holding  sathyagraha  campaigns,  non-cooperation  with  the  government,  civil 
disobendience  campaign  and  organizing  street  marches  were  the  non-violent 
strategies  adopted  by  Mahatma  Gandhi.  All  Indians,  irrestpective  of  their 
ethnicity, religion, caste or class, could participate in those campaigns. Therefore, 
Mahatma Gandhi was the leader who turned India’s Independence Movement 
into a struggle of the people. 

 Mahatma Gandhi acted paying no heed to ethnic, religious or caste differences 
that  existed  in  India  at  that  time  and  hebelieved  that  all  Indians  should  have 
equal rights. He was a very humble person and led a very simple and exemplary 
life. He said that Indians should value the products of their own country and 
he  gave  an  example  to  all  Indians  by  wearing  clothes  made  by  himself    using 
the  cotton  material  woven  by  himself.  Weaving  cotton,  disregarding  caste 
differences,  refusing  liquor,  briging  unity  between  Hindus  and  Muslims,  and 
giving  equal  opportunities  for  women  were  the  significant  features  of  the 
thinking of Mahatma Gandhi. He believed that such factors would contribute a 
lot towards the development of the country. 

   He  acted  as  the  leader  of  the  independence  movement  of  India  to  free  the 
country from the rule of the British Empire and he became a leader who was 
loved and respected by all Indians alike. Mahatma Gandhi became famous all 
over the world because of his non-violence policy. Howevermuch he was busy 
when he was in India, he even spared time to visit Sri Lanka in 1927. He stayed 
in this country for a period of about three weeks. During his stay, he travelled to 
many areas such as Colombo, Kalutara, Galle, Kandy and Jaffna, and addressed 
people. Wherever he travelled to in this country, he was warmly welcomed by 
the people of this country.

Maulana Abul Kalam Asad

Maulana  Abul  Kalam  Asad  was  born  in  1888. 
When he was a schoolboy, he had a knowledge 
matured  for  his  age.  He  was  an  outstanding 
Muslim leader in the Indian National Association 
and  was  committed  to  creating  a  united  India 
through  unity  between  the  Hindus  and  the 
Muslims.  At  a  young  age  he  started  writing  to 
newspapers and magazines, and became an able 
writer. Later he started a newspaper titled ‘Alhilal’. 
It became very popular among Muslim people. 

the 

After 

joining 

Indian  National 
Association,  Maulana  Abul  Kalam  Asad  acted 
with great commitment towards the independence movement of India. Therefore 
he got the very rare oportunity of working as the President of the Association. 
He earned the respect of all members of the Association and also became a very 
close friend of Mahatma Gandhi. He gave his fullest support to all the campaigns 
led by Mahatma Gandhi. Even on occasions where certain controversies erupted 
between the members of the National Association he took steps to settle them so 
that the independence movement could be continued without any hindrance. 

 During the time when India was about to get independence, he participated in 
various discussions that were held with authorities and he also travelled to many 
parts of the country encouraging people to calm down. In this way the service 
rendered by Maulana Abul Kalam Azad towards the success of the independence 
movement was invaluable.  

 
101

Jawaharlal Nehru

Jawaharlal Nehru was born in Allahabad in 1889 
and,  after  completing  his  school  education,  he 
went to England for higher education and then 
became  a  lawyer.  After  returning  to  India,  he 
joined the Indian National Association and acted 
as  a  leader  of  the  independence  movement  of 
India. Nehru was a scholar and an able organizer 
of  the  National  Association.  After  India  had 
gained independence, Nehru acted as the Prime 
Minister of India and did an invaluable service 
towards  the  building  up  of  modern  India.  He 
was  also  the  author  of  several  books  and  his 
book entitled ‘World History’ has been translated into many languages. Indira 
Gandhi, who became a Prime Minister of India, was a daughter of Jawaharlal 
Nehru’s.

Constitutional Reforms and the National 
Independence Movement of Sri Lanka

Introduction

The monarchical rule that had existed in this country came to an end with 
the conquest of the Kandyan kingdom by the British in 1815. Thereafter, the British 
ruled this country for a period of 133 years until Sri Lanka gained independence in 
1948. 

Because of the protest campaigns constantly launched by Lankans, British 
rulers had to introduce constitutional reforms from time to time. Lankans, who 
were not satisfied with the powers that were granted to them through such reforms, 
continued to carry out protest campaigns. It was as a result of such protests that 
Sri  Lanka  was  able  to  gain  independence  in  1948.  This  chapter  discusses  the 
political protests that were made during the rule of the British and the nature of 
the constitutional reforms that were introduced by the British rulers.  

 
 
 
 
103

5.1 Colebrooke – Cameron Reforms of 1833

After the conquest of the Kandyan kingdom by the British in 1815, the entire country 
of Lanka became a colony of the British Empire. Thereafter, by about year 1828, the 
government expenditure of this country had rapidly exceeded government revenue 
due  to  several  reasons  such  as  carrying  out  the  administration  of  the  country  by 
dividing it into two parts as the upcountry and the low country and having to incur 
a huge expenditure on paying salaries to the officials who came from Britain and 
on providing the necessary facilities to them. Therefore, under such circumstances, 
the mother government of Britain had to spend out of its own funds to cover up the 
expenses of the government of this country. Up to that time it had not been the policy 
of the Government of Britain to spend out of the funds of the mother government 
on  the  expenses  of  its  colonies.  Therefore,  the  Colonial  Secretary  appointed  a 
special  commission  to  come  to  Sri  Lanka  and  to  examine  the  revenue  situation 
and the expenditure of the government, to study the existing shortcomings of the 
administration system and to make necessary recommendations. The commission 
that was appointed was headed by W.M.G. Colebrooke and therefore was called the 
Colebrooke  Commission.  Colebrooke  was  assigned  the  responsibility  to  examine 
the nature of economic and administration affairs. Later, Charles Hay Cameron was 
appointed  to  look  into  the  judicial  affairs  of  this  country  and  to  make  necessary 
recommendations.

The duo Colebrooke and Cameron arrived in this country and studied facts related to 
the administration system and the judicial system of the country. They also consulted 
some Sri Lankans and submitted a set of proposals including their recommendations. 
It was called Colebrooke – Cameron reforms and was implemented from year 1833.

Significant Features of Colebrooke – Cameron Reforms

 ² establishment of the Legislative Council and the executive council
 ² introducing  a  system  of  government  in  which  the  upcountry  and  the  low 

country are merged

 ² dividing the country into five provinces for administration affairs
 ² abolishing of compulsory personal service 
 ² expanding the English education

Let us now briefly study each of the above features:

 ² Establishment of the Legislative Council and the Executive Council

By the time the Colebrooke Commission arrived in Lanka, the legislative powers, 
executive powers and the judicial powers had been centralized with the Governor 
of Lanka. Such an arrangement amazed Colebrooke and he therefore proposed the 
establishment of the Legislative Council and the executive council with a view to 
limiting the powers of the Governor.  

The Legislative Council

The  Legislative  Council,  which  was  established  as  per  Colebrooke  proposals  for 
the purpose of creating laws, consisted of 15 members. They were divided into two 
categories as official members and unofficial members. Accordingly, there were 9 
official members who were high ranking government officials and were appointed 
ex-officio. There were 6 unofficial members who were nominated by the Governor 
on  communal  basis.  These  unofficial  members  included  3  representatives  from 
the  Europeans  and  one  representative  each  from  Sinhala,  Tamil  and  Burgher 
communities.  The  Legislative  Council  was  presided  over  by  the  Governor.  It  is 
accepted  that  the  system  of  representing  ethnic  communities  at  the  Legislative 
Council  introduced  under  Colebrooke  reforms  paved  the  way  for  controversies 
between different ethnic groups in this country at a later stage.

The Legislative Council that was established in 1833 was subjected to reform from 

time to time and the powers vested in Lankans gradually increased. This laid the 

foundation  for  the  parliamentary  system  that  was  introduced  later.  Therefore, 

introduction of the Legislative Council under the Colebrooke system of government 

was a landmark event in the political history of this country.   

The Executive Council

The executive council that was established under Colebrooke proposals consisted of 

high ranking government officials such as the Governor and the Surveyor General 

of  the  government.  The  Governor  presided  over  the  executive  council.  It  was 

required that the Governor consults this council with regard to all administration 

and financial affairs of the country.

 ² Introduction  of  a  system  of  government  in  which  the  upcountry  and 

the low country were merged

After  the  British  had  captured  the  Kandyan  kingdom  in  1815,  they  adopted  a 

policy of governing the upcountry and low country separately. Colebrooke pointed 

out  that  this  system  had  resulted  in  the  increase  of  government  expenditure  and

the low country were merged

After  the  British  had  captured  the  Kandyan  kingdom  in  1815,  they  adopted  a 
policy of governing the upcountry and low country separately. Colebrooke pointed 
out  that  this  system  had  resulted  in  the  increase  of  government  expenditure  and 

 
                
 
106

107

proposed that the two parts should be merged and a unitary government should be 
established in the country.

 ² Expanding English Education

 ² Dividing the Country into Five Provinces for Administration

Until 1833, Lanka had been divided into 16 provinces for administration purposes. 
Colebrooke  pointed  out  that  the  government  expenditure  had  increased  because 
there were too many provinces and a lot of money had to be spent on employing 
officials and on providing facilities necessary for those officials. Therefore, in order 
to cut down government expenditure, Colebrooke proposed dividing the country 
into five administrative areas and to establish five administration centres for those 
five  provinces.  It  was  decided  to  appoint  a  Government  Agent  for  each  of  those 
provinces.

 ² Abolishing of Compulsory Personal Service System

Providing service to the government free of charge by all adult males in the country 
for a specific number of days per year was called the compulsory personal service 
system. This system was used in the past to obtain the services of people for public 
works  of  the  country.  In  villages,  public  activities  such  as  restoration  of  tanks, 
canals, anicuts and roads were done according to this system. Colebrooke pointed 
out that this system, in which services of the people were obtained without making 
any payment to them, was a hindrance for people in enjoying their freedom as well 
as in working for their development. Therefore Colebrook recommended that this 
system should be abolished.

One of the main reasons for the increase of the government expenditure at the time 

when Colebrooke came to Lanka was that the officers required for the administration 

affairs of this country had to be brought from Europe. Hence the government had to 

spend a lot of money on paying salaries to them and on providing accommodation 

and other facilities to them. Therefore Colebrooke proposed that, in order to cut 

down expenses, local official should be employed instead of bringing officers from 

Europe. In order to be able to do so, there arose the need for expanding English 

language  education.  Colebrooke  believed  that  officers  needed  for  administration 

affairs of the government could be provided by way of giving a good education in 

the English medium to local people who could afford to pay for their education. 

5.2  Protests launched by Lankans

After the Colebrooke reforms of 1833 had been implemented, it was the Europeans 

who lived in this country that launched protests first demanding that certain reforms 

should  be  made  to  the  Colebrooke  constitution.  These  Europeans  were  the  rich 

people who had come to Lanka for cultivating crops and had  engaged in plantation 

activities in upcountry areas. By that time there had arisen the need for them to get 

the required funds allocated by the Legislative for developing the road system, postal 

and communication services and other facilities in the areas where their cultivations 

were located. As stated above, three unofficial members had been appointed to the 

Legislative  Council  to  represent  these  Europeans.  However,  they  launched  such 

protests  because  the  number  of  official  members  in  the  Legislative  Council  was 

greater than that of the unofficial members and because the Legislative Council had 

not been given sufficient powers. In order to carry out those protests, they formed 

an organization called Planters’ Association of Ceylon in 1865. Europeans such as 

William Digby and George Wall were the prominent leaders of those protests. 

Consequent to the development of the plantation sector resulting in the creation 

of  an  export-import  economy  after  Colebrooke  reforms  had  been  implemented, 

even Lankans got the opportunity to engage in certain businesses and to generate 

income. During the rule of the British, some Lankans took to businesses such as 

plantation activities, wholesale and retail trade and the graphite industry, and they 

earned  profits  through  such  businesses.  The  Lankans  who  became  rich  in  this 

manner provided their children with higher education in this country and also by 

sending them to foreign countries thereby giving rise to an educated middle class.

 ² Expanding English Education

One of the main reasons for the increase of the government expenditure at the time 
when Colebrooke came to Lanka was that the officers required for the administration 
affairs of this country had to be brought from Europe. Hence the government had to 
spend a lot of money on paying salaries to them and on providing accommodation

5.2  Protests launched by Lankans

After the Colebrooke reforms of 1833 had been implemented, it was the Europeans 
who lived in this country that launched protests first demanding that certain reforms 
should  be  made  to  the  Colebrooke  constitution.  These  Europeans  were  the  rich

even Lankans got the opportunity to engage in certain businesses and to generate

earned  profits  through  such  businesses.  The  Lankans  who  became  rich  in  this 
manner provided their children with higher education in this country and also by 
sending them to foreign countries thereby giving rise to an educated middle class. 

 
108

At the beginning of the 20th century, this middle class launched protests demanding 
constitutional reforms. That is considered to be the beginning of political protests 
of Lankans.  

Out of  the educated middle classes who led the political protests at the early stage, 
leaders  such  as  Ponnambalam  Ramanathan,  Ponnambalam  Arunachalam,  Sir 
James  Peiris,  and  H.G.C.  Perera  were  prominent.  Out  of  the  organizations  that 
were formed to handle the protests that were launched at the early stage under the 
leadership of the educated Lankans, Low Country Products Association of Ceylon, 
Chillaw Association, and Jaffna Association were some of the leading ones.   

Out of the Educated Lankans, it was Sir James Peiris who first submitted a formal 
memorandum to the Colonial Secretary in 1909 explaining in detail the need for 
constitutional reforms. After that, several other petitions were submitted by various 
organizations and persons. Some of the reforms that the Lankans proposed through 
such petitions were as follows:
 ² increasing the number of unofficial members in the Legislative Council
 ² electing representatives to the legislative
 ² abolishing the communal representation system

Crewe – McCallum Constitutional Reforms of 1910

Based on the recommendations made by Governor Henry McCallum, who had been 
the Governor of Ceylon by 1910, Lord Crewe, the Colonial Secretary, introduced new 
constitutional reforms to this country in November 1910. It was called the Crewe 
– McCallum constitution. Under this constitution, the number of members in the 
constitutional council was increased up to 21. The number of official members was 
11 and that of the unofficial members was 10. Out of these 10 unofficial members, 
6  were  appointed  by  the  Governor  on  communal  representation  basis  and  the 
remaining 4 were elected (2 Europeans, 1 Burgher and 1 educated Lankan).

As far as Crewe - McCallum reforms are taken into consideration, it can be noted that 
providing space for electing representatives to the Legislative Council and giving 
opportunity to select one member to represent the educated Lankans are significant 
features of these reforms.

The provision for selecting one representative from the educated Lankans provided 
the opportunity for the middle classes of this country to represent the Legislative 
Council. It was Ponnambalam Ramanathan who was first appointed to this office.

5.4  Ceylon National Association

As mentioned above, when submitting requests 
to the Colonial Secretary before the time when 
Crewe  McCallum  reforms  were  implemented, 
various organizations and persons had submitted 
their requests separately. The educated people of 
the  middle  classes  understood  that,  submitting 
petitions  separately  as  small  organizations 
would have no impact on the colonial rulers and 
therefore,  all  those  groups  had  to  get  together 
and  form  one  common  organization  with  the 
cooperation  of  all  groups  in  order  to  raise  a 
strong voice. How the Indians formed the Indian 
National  Association  and  worked  in  unity  was 
an example to the Lankans at this point. It was as 
a result of such initiatives that Ceylon National 
Congress  was  formed  in  1919.  Ponnambalam 
Arunachalam,  who  was  an  outstanding  leader 
of the constitutional reform protest campaign of 
that time, was the founding president of Ceylon 
National Congress. 

Figure 5.1 Sir Ponnambalam

Some  of  the  smaller  organizations  that  joined  together  to  form  Ceylon  National 
Congress were as follows:

Jaffna   
  Association

Chillaw 
Association

Ceylon 
National 
Congress

Ceylon National 
Association

Ceylon Reform 
League

A  number  of  organizations  that  represented  the  different  ethnic  communities  in 

this country such as the Sinhalese, the Tamils and the Muslims joined together for a 

common purpose with a common objective and formed Ceylon National Congress 

(Lanka Jathika Sangamaya) which is a Landmark event in the political history of 

this country. 

The  main  objective  of  Ceylon  National  Congress  was  to  launch  a  very  forceful 

protest  campaign  with  the  view  of  gaining  political  power  into  the  hands  of  the 

Lankans. The key expectations of the Lankans in doing so were to get the number of 

Lankan members in the Legislative Council increased through future reforms, get 

the powers vested in the Legislative Council increased, get the opportunity to elect 

more members, and to get more opportunities for local leaders to get involved in 

administration affairs.   

The measures adopted by Ceylon National Congress to achieve the above mentioned 

objectives  were  not  at  all  aggressive  and  was  of  a  very  peaceful  nature.  Those 

measures included petitioning to the British government, petitioning to the Colonial 

Secretary,  holding  meetings  to  raise  awareness  among  people,  presenting  various 

arguments in the legislature, making efforts to gain the favour of the Governor, and 

writing to newspapers explaining the need for reforms.

5.5 Manning Constitutional Reform of 1920

The  Lankans  who  were  not  satisfied  with  the  constitutional  reforms  of  1910 

continued  to  protest  and  as  a  result  of  such  protests  constitutional  reforms  were 

introduced again in 1920. This constitution was drawn up on the recommendations 

of the Governor of Ceylon, William Manning, and therefore was called Manning 

constitution.

Legislative Council under Manning Reforms

Under the Manning constitution the number of members in the Legislative Council 

was increased up to 37. Out of them 14 were official members while 23 were unofficial 

members. Out of the 23 unofficial members, 7 were nominated by the Governor. 

The other 16 were elected, which was a very significant feature of this constitution. 

The composition of the 1920 Legislative Council was as shown in the chart below:

this country. 

The  main  objective  of  Ceylon  National  Congress  was  to  launch  a  very  forceful

arguments in the legislature, making efforts to gain the favour of the Governor, and 
writing to newspapers explaining the need for reforms.

5.5 Manning Constitutional Reform of 1920

The  Lankans  who  were  not  satisfied  with  the  constitutional  reforms  of  1910 
continued  to  protest  and  as  a  result  of  such  protests  constitutional  reforms  were 
introduced again in 1920. This constitution was drawn up on the recommendations 
of the Governor of Ceylon, William Manning, and therefore was called Manning 
constitution.

Legislative Council under Manning Reforms

Under the Manning constitution the number of members in the Legislative Council 
was increased up to 37. Out of them 14 were official members while 23 were unofficial 
members. Out of the 23 unofficial members, 7 were nominated by the Governor. 
The other 16 were elected, which was a very significant feature of this constitution. 
The composition of the 1920 Legislative Council was as shown in the chart below:

According to this chart, it seems at a glance that the number of unofficial members 
in the Legislative Council was greater than that of the official members, but when 
there  was  a  division,  the  seven  members  who  were  nominated  by  the  Governor 
joined the official members and therefore the Governor had more votes as against 
the 16 elected members.

Manning – Devonshire Constitutional Reforms of 1924

The expectations of the Lankans were not fulfilled through the constitutional reforms 
of  1920.  Therefore,  Ceylon  National  Congress  was  against  these  reforms.  The 
Congress was also making arrangements to boycott the election that was to be held 
under the 1920 reforms. During this period, severe public agitations were growing 
in India against the rule of the English. The English feared that a similar situation 
would occur in Sri Lanka, too. Therefore, Governor Manning gave the promise to 
the Ceylon National Congress that another reform would be introduced very soon 
if the National Congress agreed to the 1920 reforms and acted accordingly. It was 
as a result of this promise that constitutional reforms were introduced once again 
in  1924.  These  reforms  were  drawn  up  by  the  Colonial  Secretary  Devonshire  on 
the recommendation of the Governor William Manning and therefore were called 
Manning – Devonshire reforms.

 
113

Under Manning – Devonshire reforms, the membership of the Legislative Council 
was increased up to 49 members. Out of them, 12 were official members and 37 
were unofficial members. Out of the 37 unofficial members, 29 were elected and 8 
were nominated by the Governor. Out of the 29 members who were elected, 23 were 
elected  on  a  territorial  basis  and  6  were  appointed  on  communal  representation 
basis.

According to these reforms, the total of the 12 official members and the 8 nominated 
members formed a minority as against the 23 elected members. Therefore, within 
the  Legislative  Council  there  was  no  majority  vote  for  the  governor.  When  this 
constitution  was  put  into  operation,  this  situation  put  the  Governor  in  a  very 
difficult situation. 

Lankans  were  dissatisfied  about  the  requirements  that  a  person  had  to  fulfill  in 
order to become eligible to cast vote at elections to elect members to the Legislative 
Council  under  the  1924  reforms  as  well  as  under  the  1920  reforms.  In  order  to 
become a voter, one should have got the ability to read or write in some language 
and should also have possessed property or some means of income. This had greatly 
limited the number of eligible voters.

 
114

5.7  Donoughmore Constitutional Reforms 1931

As Lankans got the majority of seats in the Legislative Council under Manning – 
Devonshire constitution, the Governor had to act very strategically. The Governor of 
Lanka complained about this situation to the Colonial Secretary and consequently 
the  Donoughmore  commission  was  appointed  in  1927  to  study  the  situation  in 
Lanka  and  to  submit  necessary  recommendations.  This  commission  which  was 
headed by Lord Donoughmore arrived in Lanka, collected evidence from Lankans 
and submitted its recommendations after carrying out extensive investigations. The 
constitutional reforms that were made based on those recommendations are called 
the Donoughmore Constitution.   

Let us now study some of the Donoughmore reforms separately.

Establishment of a State Council

The Legislative Council that was established under the Donoughmore constitution 
was called the State Council. The number of members in the State Council was 61. 
Out of them, 50 members were elected by the public on territorial basis and 8 were 
nominated by the Governor to represent the minority communities that were not 
represented through vote. The remaining 3 members were state officers, namely the 
State Secretary, the Finance Secretary and the Legal Secretary.

The Chair of the State Council went to the Speaker who was elected by the members 
of the Council. Accordingly, A.F. Molamure was elected as the first Speaker of the 
State Council. The term of office of the State Council was 5 years.

Granting of Universal Franchise

Although  people  had  been  enfranchised  for  electing  members  to  the  Legislative 
Council since Crewe – McCallum reforms of 1910, it was limited to a very small 
portion of the population. One needed to have received education up to a certain 
level  and  should  also  have  possessed  wealth  in  order  to  get  qualified  to  vote  at 
elections.  Therefore,  ordinary  people  did  not  have  the  right  to  vote  at  elections; 
thus the number of those who were eligible to vote was as small as 4% of the total 
population. The Donoughmore commission pointed out that, when ordinary people 
were kept out of the political platform in this manner, the attention of the politicians 
would  not  be  directed  towards  the  needs  of  the  ordinary  people.  Therefore,  the 
commission recommended that universal franchise should be granted in order to 
politically empower ordinary people and to make politicians draw their attention 
towards  the  wellbeing  of  ordinary  people.  Accordingly,  both  males  and  females 
over 21 years were given the right to vote at elections. This can be considered as a 
great victory achieved by the ordinary people. In this way, out of all colonies of the 
British Empire, Sri Lanka became the first Asian country to gain universal franchise 
without any difference.

Establishment of Executive Committees

The State Council functioned as a board that carried out legislative and executive 
functions.  Legislative  functions  that  had  been  assigned  to  this  Council  were 
implemented by the Council by meeting as a whole House. For carrying out executive 
functions, the State Council were divided into seven committees. Accordingly, out 
of the 61 members who were appointed to the State Council after a general election, 
except  for  the  Speaker  and  the  3  state  officers,  the  remaining  57  members  were 
divided into 7 committees. The 7 committees were as follows:

 ² Committee on Home Affairs
 ² Committee on Agriculture and Lands
 ² Committee on Local Government
 ² Committee on Health
 ² Committee on Education
 ² Committee on Labour, Industry and Commerce
 ² Committee on Transport and Public Works

 
116

Each committee had to meet separately and select a chairperson for the committee. 
Each of these chairpersons were appointed as the Minister in charge of the relevant 
subject of the committee. 

These  seven  chairpersons  and  the  three  state  officers  were  considered  as 

ministers. 

Because  of 

the  executive  committees 

the 
Donoughmore  constitution,  Lankan  politicians  got  the  opportunity  to  get  some 
training on government affairs. It was a distinctive landmark in the journey towards 
parliamentary government.   

functioned  under 

that 

The Governor and the Three State Officers

In comparison with the constitutions that had been in effect up to this time, the powers 
that had been vested in the Governor were largely reduced through Donoughmore 
reforms. Donoughmore commissioners did not expect to assign the Governor with 
all  responsibilities  of  the  government  and  wished  to  assign  with  Lankans  a  part 
of the responsibility of government. Accordingly, the Governor was assigned with 
responsibilities such as of granting the final approval for the acts passed by the State 
Council, appointing officers to the public service, and making decisions regarding 
affairs that relate to the British Empire.

Under  the  Donoughmore  constitution,  important  aspects  of  government  such  as 
security, finance, and law were assigned to the three state officers, namely the Chief 
Secretary, the Finance Secretary and the Legal Secretary.

Abolishing of Communal Representation System

When selecting members to the Legislative Council, the British had implemented 
the  communal  representation  system.  This  was  a  system  which  led  to  various 
controversies  between  different  ethnic  communities  in  the  country.  Therefore, 
Lankans  had  been  raising  their  voice  until  1931  demanding  that  communal 
representation  system  be  abolished.  It  is  praiseworthy  that  the  communal 
representation  system  was  abolished  and  territorial  representation  system  was 
strengthened under the Donoughmore constitution.

 
 
 
117

5.8  Soulbury Constitutional Reforms of 1947

Appointment of the Soulbury Commission

Although  Lankans  were  granted  powers  with  regard  to  seven  of  the  ten 
ministries that were established under the Donoughmore constitution, they were 
not happy about assigning of three important ministries to the three state officers 
and about the powers that had been vested in the Governor. Therefore, soon after 
the  Donoughmore  constitution  had  been  implemented,  protests  were  launched 
demanding that this constitution be reformed and a new constitution be introduced. 
Some of the key objectives of such protests were as follows:

 ² vesting in Lankans the powers of the ministries that had been assigned to the 

state officers

 ² increasing the powers that had been granted to the Lankan ministers
 ² getting a system of cabinet established instead of the executive council system

The board of ministers and representatives of the people in the State Council played 
a leading role in carrying out these protests. Organizations such as Ceylon National 
Congress supported the board of ministers.

Figure 5.2 – Lord Soulbury

 
 
118

As World War II broke out in 1939, the British needed the support of the Lankans 
for fighting in the war. Britain played a prominent role among the countries that 
fought against Germany in this war. In this difficult situation, the board of ministers 
extended the cooperation of this country to the British. The objective of the Lankans 
in extending their cooperation to the British was to get implemented constitutional 
reforms through which Lankans got more powers. While the war was being fought, 
the Ministers of this country got the opportunity to work in close collaboration with 
the Governor and other British officers. Consequently, the British officers seemed to 
have developed a more flexible attitude towards the political requests of the people. 

In May 1943, the Governor of Ceylon issued a statement explaining the policy of 
the Government of Britain on the constitutional reforms of Sri Lanka. According to 
that statement, the British were making arrangements to introduce reforms through 
which Lankans would be given the responsibility of handling the internal affairs of 
the country. Accordingly, the board of ministers was given the powers to prepare 
a suitable draft constitution. When preparing the draft constitution, the board of 
ministers took steps to get the assistance of Sir Ivor Jennings, who was an expert in 
the field of constitutional law. 

Preparing  of  the  draft  constitution  of  the  board  of  ministers  was  completed  in 
February  1944.  In  July  1944,  the  Government  of  Britain  appointed  a  special 
commission to study the draft constitution prepared by the board of ministers, to 
discuss that constitution with the minority communities and other parties, and to 
submit a report to the Government of Britain. This commission was headed by Lord 
Soulbury and therefore was called Soulbury Commission. 

  In  December  1944,  Soulbury  Commission  arrived  in  this  country  and,  having 
studied  the  necessary  areas,  issued  its  report  in  1945.  The  constitution  that  was 
prepared  based  on  the  recommendations  of  that  report  was  implemented  in  this 
country from 1947. It was called the Soulbury constitution.  

Key Features of the Soulbury Constitution

 ² abolishing the office of Governor and establishing the office of Governor General

 ² establishing a bicameral parliament (House of Commons and the Senate)

 ² establishing a Cabinet of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister

 ² establishing the Public Service Commission and the Judicial Service Commission

 
119

Governor General

The office of the Governor that had existed up to that time was abolished under the 
Soulbury constitution. Even under this constitution, the Queen of Britain was ac-
cepted as the head of state of Ceylon, and therefore, the office of Governor General 
was created to represent the Queen. The Governor General was appointed by the 
Queen. Although the Governor General was granted a lot of legislative, executive 
and judicial powers, he had to act on the advice of the Prime Minister and therefore 
this  became  merely  a  nominal  executive  position.  The  then  Governor  Sir  Henry 
Monck Mason Moore was appointed as the first Governor General of Lanka. 

Figure 5.3 – Sir Henry Monck Mason Moore

Parliament

Under  the  Soulbury  constitution,  the  legislative  or  the  institution  that  is 
responsible for making laws was called ‘parliament’. As the parliament consisted of 
both the House of Commons and the Senate, it was called a bicameral parliament.   

House of Commons, which was the first House of the parliament, consisted of 101 
members. Out of them 95 were elected by the people on a constituency basis and 
the remaining 6 were appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime 
Minister to represent the minority communities that were not represented through 
the election. The term of office of Parliament was 5 years.  

The second House of the parliament was the Senate or the Upper House. This House 
consisted of 30 members. Out of them, 15 members were appointed by the Governor 
General on the advice of the Prime Minister. The remaining 15 were elected by the 
House of Commons. The term of office of the Senate was 6 years.

Under the Soulbury Constitution, the Cabinet 
of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister was 
vested with executive powers or the powers of 
implementing laws. The Prime Minister was the 
Head of the Cabinet of Ministers. The member 
who  won  the  confidence  of  the  majority  of 
members was appointed to the office of Prime 
Minister  by  the  Governor  General.  Further, 
the Governor General appointed the cabinet of 
ministers on the recommendation of the Prime 
Minister. The Cabinet of Ministers was selected 
from among the members who represented the 
government  in  the  House  of  Representatives 
and 
the 
Senate.  In  terms  of  the  Soulbury  constitution, 
two members of the senate had to be appointed 
to the cabinet of ministers and one of these two 
should be the Minister of Justice. Maintaining 
the independence of the judiciary was the objective of setting out such provisions. 
Collective responsibility to Parliament was a significant feature of the Cabinet of 
Ministers.

Introduction

As  Sri  Lanka  gained  independence  in  1948,  a  system  of  government 

with  parliament  democracy  was  established  in  the  country.  Introduction  of  a 

republican constitution in 1972 in place of the Soulbury constitution that had been 

in effect up to that time and implementation of a new constitution with executive 

presidency in 1978 were landmark events in the political history of this country. 

This chapter discusses the nature of the governments that came into power during 

the period of about three decades after gaining independence, policies adopted by 

those governments and some of the key sectors in the development of the country. 

Further, this chapter also focuses on the key features of the constitutions that were 
introduced in 1972 and 1978.   

 
124

6.1 The Election of 1947

The election for electing 95 members to the Parliament that was established under 
the Soulbury constitution was held in August 1947. It was the first parliamentary 
election  that  was  held  in  Sri  Lanka.  At  this  election,  the  United  National  Party 
(UNP)  was  able  to  win  42  seats  in  Parliament.  After  the  UNP,  it  was  the  Lanka 
Sama Samaja Party that won the highest number of seats; it won 10 seats. The total 
number of seats that all the other parties won was 22. It is significant to note that 
21  independent  candidates  who  contested  at  this  election  won  their  seats.  D.S. 
Senanayake, who was the leader of the UNP, the party that won the highest number 
of seats, formed a government with the support of several independent candidates. 
Accordingly, D.S. Senanayake became the first Prime Minister of Sri Lanka.

Even  before  the  election  of  1947,  D.S.  Senanayake  had  had  discussions  with  the 
Government  of  Britain  regarding  gaining  independence  for  Sri  Lanka.  By  this 
time, the Government of Britain was making arrangements to grant independence 
to India. D.S. Senanyake’s representatives explained to the Government of Britain 
that, as a country that supported Britain in its difficult times during the World War 
II,  Sri  Lanka,  too,  has  the  right  to  get  independence. The  English,  who  admitted 
that the arguments put forward by the Lankans were reasonable, stated even before 
the election of 1947 that action would be taken by the Government of Britain to 
give independence to Sri Lanka after the election was over. Even the British were 
pleased that the UNP won in the election of 1947 and that D.S. Senanayake became 
the  Prime  Minister  of  the  country.  As  the  newly  elected  Prime  Minister,  D.S. 
Senanayake entered into an agreement with Britain on security matters. In terms 
of  this  agreement,  Britain  agreed  to  take  necessary  action  to  ensure  the  security 
of Lanka and Sri Lanka agreed to allow Britain to use the harbours, airports and 
other places in Sri Lanka for military activities if Britain required. After the said 
agreement had been signed, in November 1947, the Parliament of Britain passed 
the Ceylon Independence Act which contained provisions for giving independence 
to Sri Lanka. As per the order issued by the King, this act came into effect from 4th 
February 1948. With the enactment of this Act, Sri Lanka once again became an 
independent country.

6.2 General Elections that were held in Sri Lanka after gaining 
Independence and the Polices implemented by the Governments 
that came into Power after that

General Election of 1952

D.S. Senanayake, the first Prime Minister of independent Sri Lanka, died in March 
1952. In order to fill this vacant position, the Governor General appointed Dudley 
Senanayake, the son of D.S. Senanayake, as the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. By this 
time, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike had left the UNP and had formed a new political party 
named Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). On the advice of Dudley Senanayake, the 
Governor General dissolved Parliament even before the due date, and this resulted 
in holding the general election of 1952. 

Results of the General Election of 1952

 ² The number of seats to be elected through the election    
     - 95
 ² The number of  seats won by the UNP 
     - 54
 ² The number of seats won by the SLFP 
     - 09
 ² The number of seats won by the other parties and independent groups       - 32

The UNP, which won the majority of the seats in Parliament through the election 
of 1952, formed a government and Dudley Senanayake, who was the leader of the 
UNP, became the Prime Minister.

The following are some of the significant events that took place in the political arena 
of this country during the period from 1952 – 1956: 

 ² eruption  of  a  Hartal  campaign  in  1953  against  Dudley  Senanayake's  
government in response to the increase of the price of food items including rice,
 ² executing  of  this  Hartal  campaign  with  the  support  of  the  leftist  parties  and 

trade unions,

      
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
126

 ² resignation  of  Dudley  Senanayake  as  Prime  Minister  and  appointment  of  Sir 
John Kotelawala, who was a senior member of that party, as the Prime Minister,
 ² Sri Lanka getting the membership of the United Nations Organization in 1955 

during the rule of Sir John Kotelawala,

 ² dissolving the parliament before the due date,
 ² accordingly, holding an election in 1956.

General Election of 1956

It is significant to note that, at the 
general election of 1956, the UNP 
contested  as  a  single  party  while 
the  SLFP,  together  with  a  number 
of parties such as the Sama Samaja 
the 
(revolutionary)  and 
Party 
Sinhala  Language  Front  (Bhasha 
Peramuna),  and  with  the  support 
independent 
of  a  number  of 
candidates, contested as Mahajana 
Eksath  Peramuna.  By  this  time, 
Mahajana  Eksath  Peramuna  was 
supported  by  five  forces,  namely 
the  Bhikkus,  doctors,  teachers, 
farmers and workers.

 ² The number seats won by the UNP 
    - 08
 ² The number of seats won by the other parties and independent groups      - 36

Having won the majority of seats in Parliament, Mahajana Eksath Peramuna formed 
a government and S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, who was the leader of Mahajana Eksath 
Peramuna became the Prime Minister.

Policies of the Government formed in 1956

 ² taking steps to develop local industries and agriculture
 ² nationalization  of  the  harbour,  nationalization  of  the  privately  owned  bus 

services and starting nationalized enterprises
 ² making Sinhala language the official language 

In 1956, Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike was assassinated by a gunman. After 
his death, Wijayananda Dahanayake was appointed as the Prime Minister. However, 
before long, there erupted internal conflicts within the government and therefore 
the government had to be dissolved. Consequently, an election was held again in 
March 1960.

General Election of 1960

By year 1960, the deliminatation commission which determines the bounderies of 
constituencies had decided that the number of seats in the Parliament that are elected 
through the general election should be 151. It was a significant feature of this election 
that the parties that had been organized as Mahajana Eksath Peramuna in the 1956 
election contested at the 1960 election as separate parties and individuals.

General Election of July 1960

By  the  time  of  the  election  of  July  1960,  Mrs.  Sirimavo  Bandaranaike  had  been 
appointed as the leader of the SLFP. It was a significant event that the SLFP contested 
in this election having entered into a non-compete agreement with the Lanka Sama 
Samaja Party and the Communist Party.  

Results of the General Election held in July 1960

 ² The number of seats to be elected through the election

Sri  Lanka  Freedom  Party,  together  with  the  Lanka  Sama  Samaja  Party  and  the 
Communist Party, organized themselves as the United Front (Samagi Peramuna) 
and  formed  a  government  after  this  election.  Mrs.  Sirimavo  Bandaranaike  was 
appointed as the Prime Minister of this government. Accordingly, she became the 
first woman Prime Minister in the world. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
129

Policies  of  the  government  that  was  formed  through  the  election  of  July 
1960:
 ² Going ahead with the programme of nationalizing enterprises that was started 
by S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike government in 1956. Under this programme all the 
schools were taken over by the government.

 ² Adopting reforms that were focused on developing the local economy. 
 ² Under these reforms, People’s Bank was established in 1961.

Through  these  measures  the  farmer  communities  got  the  opportunity  to  obtain 
loans for agricultural purposes. 

General Election of 1965

The  government  that  came  into  power  in  1960  had  to  be  dissolved  before  the 
completion  of  its  term  of  office  due  to  several  reasons  such  as  the  resignation  of 
14  members  led  by  C.P.  Silva  and  because  of  the  severe  economic  crisis  that  the 
government had to face. Accordingly, an election was held in 22 nd March 1965.

Results of the General Election of 1965

 ² The number of seats to be elected through the election    
    - 151
 ² The number of seats won by the UNP 
    - 66
 ² The number of seats won by the SLFP 
    - 41
 ² The number of seats won by the Federal Party 
    - 14
 ² The number of seats won by Lanka Sama Samaja Party   
    - 10
 ² The number of seats won by the other parties and independent groups      - 20

In this election no party won a majority of seats to form a government. However, 
the United National party, together with the Federal Party and a number of other 
small  parties,  formed  a  coalition  government.  Dudley  Senanayake,  the  leader  of 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
130

the  United  National  Party,  became  the  Prime  Minister  for  the  third  time.  It  is  a 
significant feature that this government ruled the country until the completion of 
its entire term of office.   

6.3 Introduction of the First Republican Constitution in 1972 and Sri 

Lanka’s becoming a Republic

Soulbury constitution, which was introduced by the British, was implemented in this 
country from 1948 to 1972. However, it was the view of Lankans that the freedom 
given to Sri Lanka was not complete because the Queen of England continued to 
be  accepted  as  the  head  of  state  of  this  country  and  because  there  were  various 
limitations with regard to making of laws by the Parliament. Therefore, the need for 
making a new constitution for the country was pointed out by various sections of 
society such as politicians, scholars and critiques. However, since there were legal 
restrictions with regard to replacing of Soulbury constitution, it could not be done 
until 1972.

Key Features of the First Republican Constitution of 1972

National State Council

In terms of the first republican constitution of 1972, the legislative or the institution 
that  is  responsible  for  making  laws  was  called  the  National  State  Assemble.  This 
was an institution that consisted only of representatives that were elected by people. 
Therefore it can be called as a unicameral legislature. The National State Assembly 
consisted of 168 members. This Assemble had full powers to make laws. The term 
of office of this Assembly was 6 years. The following are some of the functions of the 
National State Assembly. 
 ² creating laws
 ² financial management
 ² controlling the executive

Office of President

The office of President was introduced under the constitution of 1972 in place of 
the  office  of  Governor  General  that  had  been  in  effect  in  terms  of  the  Soulbury 
constitution. Until that time, the Governor General had acted as the representative of 
the Queen of England, but under the 1972 constitution, the President was the leader 
of the people of Sri Lanka. The President was appointed 
by the Prime Minister and the person appointed as the 
President  had  to  be  a  citizen  of  Sri  Lanka.  Under  the 
new constitution, the President was granted most of the 
powers that had been previously granted to the Governor 
General.  The  President  had  to  exercise  those  powers 
on  the  advice  of  the  Prime  Minister.  Therefore,  under 
the  1972  constitution,  the  President  held  a  nominal 
executive  position. The  term  of  office  of  the  President 
was  4  years.  William  Gopallawa,  who  had  been  the 
Governor General until that time, was appointed as the 
first President of this country.

133

Cabinet of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister

Under  the  first  republican  constitution  of  1972,  executive  powers  or  the  power 
to  implement  laws  was  vested  in  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers  headed  by  the  Prime 
Minister. This was also called the true executive. The Prime Minister was the head 
of the Cabinet of Ministers. The member who gained the highest confidence of the 
National State Assembly was appointed as the prime minsiter by the President. The 
President appointed the other Ministers on the advice of the Prime Minister. It was 
a significant feature that the Cabinet of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister was 
collectively accountable to the National State Assembly.

134

The Judiciary

Under  the  first  republican  constitution  of  1972,  a  system  of  courts  had  been 
established in order to dispense justice. It was consisted of a numbers of courts as 
follows:

supreme Court

high court

district court

magistrate court

constitutional court 

The  Supreme  Court  and  the  high  court  were  the  two  higher  courts  that  were 
established under the first republican constitution of 1972. Although the power to 
hear appeal cases of this country was granted to the British Privy Council under 
the Soulbury constitution, that power was vested in the Supreme Court under the 
constitution of 1972.

 ² The district court was given the power to hear civil cases of all types while the 
power to hear criminal cases of all types was vested in the magistrate court.

 ² The  constitutional  court  was 
established  to  examine  whether 
the  bills  presented  to  parliament 
were 
the 
in  consistence  with 
constitution. 

Second Republican Constitution of 

1978

After the death of Dudley Senanayake 
in  1973,  J.R.  Jayawardane  became  the 
leader  of  the  United  National  Party. 
The  United  National  Party  contested 
in the 1977 general election under the 
leadership  of  J.R.  Jayawardane  and 
won  a  5/6  majority  in  the  National 
State  Assembly.  Tamil  United  Front 
had  won  18  seats,  but  the  Sri  Lanka  Fig. 6.6  Mr. J.R. Jayawardane – The first 

Executive President of  Sri Lanka

 
 
 
 
 
135

Freedom Party was able to win only 8 seats. Because of the strong mandate given 
to the UNP, the UNP government took steps to get a new constitution passed. This 
new  constitution  was  adopted  since  1978  and  was  called  the  Second  Republican 
constitution.     

According  to  the  constitution  of  1978,  Sri  Lanka  is  called  the  Democratic 
Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka,  and  the  constitution  also  states  that  Sri  Lanka 
is  a  unitary  state.  It  is  a  special  feature  that,  unlike  in  the  constitutions  that  had 
previously been in effect, this new constitution states that the parliament is not the 
only institution that exercise legislative powers, even people have such powers in a 
referendum. 

Key Features of the 1978 Constitution

Executive Presidency

The most significant  feature  of the  1978 constitution  was  the introduction  of  the 
office of Executive President, which had full executive powers, in place of the titular 
executive presidency. 

In terms of the constitution of 1978, the 
President  is  the  head  of  the  state,  the 
head  of  the  executive,  the  head  of  the 
government  and  the  commander-in-
chief  of  the  armed  forces  of  Sri  Lanka. 
Accordingly, the office of President is the 
highest executive position of the country 
with full executive powers. The President 
is  directly  elected  by  the  people  and  a 
separate Presidential election is held for 
electing  the  President.  Originally  the 
term of office of the executive President 
was  6  years,  but  through  the  19th 
amendment  to  the  constitution,  it  was 
reduced to 5 years.

The  President  is  conferred  with  a  lot  of 
powers in the fields of the legislative, the 
executive and the judiciary. Although the 

Fig 6.7 Opposition Leader 

Mr. A. Amirthalingam

136

President is not a member of the parliament, he has a lot of powers related to the 
parliament. Some of those powers are as follows:     
 ² calling the parliament to convene, and proroguing and dissolving the parliament
 ² presiding over the first meeting of the parliament
 ² presenting the manifesto of the government to the parliament
 ² attending the meetings of the parliament and addressing the parliament on any 

occasion 

Some of the executive powers vested in the President are as follows:
 ² appointing the Prime Minister
 ² appointing  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers  and  assigning  subjects  and  tasks  to  the 

ministers

 ² appointing officers to high posts of the government
 ² acting as the head of the Cabinet of Ministers
 ² appointing the Chief Justice and other judges of the Supreme Court
 ² appointing the president and the other judges of the court of appeal
 ² appointing the Judicial Service Commission
 ² granting pardon to offenders

In  addition  to  these,  the  President,  as  the  head  of  the  state,  has  been  assigned  a 
number of tasks. The following are some of them:
 ² taking the Chair of national celebrations
 ² keeping the Public Seal of the republic and signing the documents which need 

to be signed putting the public seal
 ² representing the republic internationally
 ² appointing diplomats and receiving diplomats appointed to this country

Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers

In  terms  of  the  constitution  of  1978,  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers  also  functions  as 
a part of the executive in addition to the Executive President. The President acts 
as the head of the Cabinet of Ministers and appoints the Prime Minister and the 
other ministers. It is a significant feature that the powers that had been vested in 
the Prime Minister under the constitution of 1972 have been given to the executive 
President under the constitution of 1978. Implementing the laws that are passed by 
the parliament and being responsible for the relevant subjects assigned are examples 
for the functions of the ministers of the cabinet.

137

Parliament 

The legislative or the law making institute that was established under the second 
republican constitution of 1978 was called the parliament. As the parliament consists 
of  a  house  of  representatives  only,  it  is  a  unicameral  legislative.  The  parliament 
consists of 225 members. Out of the 225 members, 196 members are elected by the 
people under the proportional representation system and 29 members are appointed 
from  the  national  list.  Members  are  selected  from  the  national  list  based  on  the 
proportion  of  the  total  number  of  votes  that  each  party  obtained  at  the  general 
election. The term of office of the Parliament was 6 years (It was reduced to 5 years 
through the 19th amendment to the constitution). 

The following are some examples for the functions of the parliament:
 ² formulation of laws
 ² financial management
 ² moving impeachments against the President
 ² presenting grievances of the public 

The Judiciary

A  judiciary  system  has  been  introduced  under  the  1978  constitution  to  dispense 
justice. It is as follows:

Supreme Court

court of appeal

high court

district court

family court

magistrate court

primary court  

Except for the Supreme Court and the court of appeal, all the other courts are courts 
of  first  instance.  Courts  before  which  cases  that  are  not  referred  to  the  Supreme 
Court or the court of appeal are called first instance courts. 

In Sri Lanka, the highest court of law and the court of final appeal is the 
Supreme Court. This consists of the Chief Justice, who is the head, and a number of 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
138

judges that is not less than six and not more than ten. The Chief Justice and the other 
judges of the Supreme Court are appointed by the President. 

The following are some of the functions of the Supreme Court:  

 ² hearing of cases related to fundamental rights
 ² hearing of impeachments that are presented to parliament against the President
 ² hearing of cases related to election petitions
 ² acting as the court of final appeal

The court of appeal has the power to hear the appeal cases that are filed against the 
determinations issued by lower courts.

Fundamental Rights

Chapter III of the constitution relates to fundamental rights. It is significant that 
the fundamental rights have been comprehensively set out when compared to the 
constitution of 1972. The following are some of the rights set out in the constitution: 

 ² freedom of speech and expression

 ² freedom of religion

The constitution of 1972 did not specify the action that could be taken in case of a 
violation of rights due to some cause. Correcting this shortcoming, the constitution 
of 1978 provides that, in case of a violation of fundamental rights, justice can be 
sought through the Supreme Court or through the ombudsman.  

Development Programmes of Sri Lanka after Independence

During the rule of the British, the economy of Sri Lanka had been organized with 
the  objective  of  fulfilling  the  needs  of  the  English.  The  politicians  who  came  to 
power after gaining independence in 1948 carried the responsibility of managing 
the economy of the country in a way that the needs of the local people could be 
fulfilled. Therefore, every government that came to power after 1948 took steps to 

139

implement various measures to improve the living conditions of the people of this 
country. Accordingly, various policies and programmes have been drawn up and 
implemented for the purposes of developing the agriculture and other industries, 
for developing the education sector and for improving social welfare, etc.

Developing Paddy Cultivation 

Under the rule of the British, there was a severe decline in paddy cultivation since 
the  central  focus  of  the  government  was  on  export  agriculture  that  was  centred 
round  estate  plantations.  Because  of  this  reason,  by  the  time  the  Donoughmore 
reforms were introduced, a considerable amount of food items including rice had to 
be imported from other countries.  

D.S. Senanayake, who was the Minister of Agriculture during the period from 1931 
to 1947 at the time of the State Council, had realized the importance of developing 
paddy  cultivation  and  acted  accordingly.  After  1948,  the  responsibility  of  solving 
issues  of  this  country  was  assigned  to  Lankans  themselves  and  therefore,  every 
government that came into power took steps to develop paddy cultivation. Some 
of  the  policies  that  have  been  implemented  with  the  view  to  developing  paddy 
cultivation and improving the wellbeing of farmer communities are as follows:
 ² establishing Govi Janapadas (farmer’s colonies) in the Dry Zone
 ² implementing the Mahaweli development project
 ² establishing  the  Paddy  Research  Institute  and  introducing  new  varieties  of 

paddy to farmers

 ² establishing  Agrarian  Service  Centres  and  introducing  a  guaranteed  price 

system

 ² taking steps to provide loan facilities to farmers through state owned banks 

Govi Janapada movement that had been launched by D.S. Senanayake during the 
period  of  the  State  Council  was  continuously  implemented  even  after  gaining 
independence. Under this project, people were selected from the Wet Zone of the 
country and they were provided with lands from the Dry Zone so that they could 
settle there and cultivate those lands. There were several objectives in establishing 
such colonies:
 ² increasing the food production of the country
 ² restoration of the old tanks and irrigation systems in the Dry Zone and utilizing 

the lands in those areas for the economic development of the country

140

 ² reducing the escalating population density and lack of employment opportunities 

in the Wet Zone 

 ² A number of farmers’ colonies were established in this country before and after 
gaining independence. Some of them include the colonies in Devahuwa, Gal 
Oya, Kanthale, Iranamadu, Minneriya, Minipe, Padaviya, and Rajanganaya.

After  the  establishment  of  farmers’  colonies,  there  awakened  a  great  interest  in 
restoration  of  old  tanks  and  bunds  and  construction  of  irrigation  systems.  Gal 
Oya development project, which was started in 1949, is an example for such newly 
constructed irrigation schemes. This project, which was implemented for achieving 
a  number  of  objectives,  is  the  first  multi-purpose  development  project  of  this 
country.

Mahaweli Development Project

The Mahaweli Development Project is an outstanding one among the projects that 
were implemented with the objectives of developing the paddy cultivation and the 
agriculture of this country by the governments that came into power after gaining 
independence. Mahaweli project was implemented with the objective of utilizing for 
the economic development of the country the waters of the Mahaweli river, which is 
nourished by a large number of tributaries. The following are some of the objectives 
of implementing the Mahaweli project:

141

 ² providing a regular water supply to the agricultural lands in the Dry Zone,
 ² generating electricity,
 ² providing  lands  through  new  settlements  to  people  who  did  not  own  lands 
and expanding the cultivation of food crops thereby creating a satisfied farmer 
community,

 ² breeding freshwater fish,
 ² generating employment opportunities.

As the first phase of the Mahaweli project, the Polgolla project was commenced in 
1970 by constructing a dam across the Mahaweli river. It was planned to provide 
water to Kala Oya, Nachchaduwa Tank, Nuwara Wewa and a number of other tanks 
through this scheme.

Originally it had been planned to complete the construction of the Mahaweli project 
in 30 years, but J.R. Jayawardane government, which came into power in 1977, took 
measures to complete it within a period of 6 years. A number of projects such as 
Victoria, Randenigala, Rantembe, Kotmale, Ulhitiya, Rathkinda and Maduru Oya 
were implemented and under these projects vast extents of lands were agriculturally 
developed. The waters of the Mahaweli river were collected in the reservoirs and, 
having utilized for generating electricity, were then sent to the Dry Zone to provide 
water  to  the  lands  that  had  already  been  cultivated  and  also  to  bring  new  lands 
under cultivation.  

Development in the Industrial Sector

Before  1931,  the  industries  of  Sri  Lanka  had  been  limited  to  the  production  or 
processing of tea, rubber, coconut and other crop-related products. Producing tea 
from tender tea leaves, producing sheet rubber from latex, and producing copra or 
coconut oil from coconut are examples for such industries. There were factories for 
weaving cloth and for making implements necessary for plantations, etc. and there 
also were several industries. In addition to that, there were a number of traditional 
cottage industries such as blacksmith’s work, pottery, and making cane furniture as 
well as handicrafts. However, as there was no significant progress in the industrial 
sector,  industrial  goods  required  for  the  country  had  to  be  imported  from  other 
countries.

During  the  period  from  1939  to  1945,  in  which  World  War  II  was  being  fought, 
importation  of  goods  from  other  countries  became  difficult. Therefore  industries 
were established in this country itself in order to produce goods such as crockery, 
paper, soap and perfume required for the people of this country. However, after the 

142

war  had  ended,  there  were  no  obstacles  for  the  shipping  industry  and  therefore, 
foreign products began to be imported to this country once again. As the imported 
goods were produced using the latest technology, they were of higher quality, and 
local products could not compete with the imported ones. This resulted in a gradual 
decline in the local industries.  

Under  the  first  government  that  came  into  power  after  independence,  a  separate 
ministry for industry and fisheries, and a department of industry were established. 
Because of the policy adopted by the government of that time, it was accepted that 
large-scale  industries  such  as  cement,  paper,  chemical  fertilizer,  sugar,  iron  and 
steel  had  to  be  established  as  public  enterprises. Therefore,  there  were  minimum 
opportunities for the private sector to establish large-scale industries. Further, even 
the  government  lacked  sufficient  funds  to  start  large-scale  industries.  For  these 
reasons, there was no substantial progress in the industrial sector until the lapse of 
about five years since independence. 

However, the government was able to set up the cement factory in Kankasanturai 
during this period. 

A group of representatives from the World Bank arrived in Sri Lanka, and having 
examined the development activities that had been implemented in this country, 
they  presented  a  report  in  1952.  Through  that  report  they  had  recommended 
that  the  government  should  go  into  small  and  medium  scale  industries  rather 
than establishing large-scale ones. The report of another commission, which had 
been  appointed  by  the  government  to  examine  and  report  the  situation  of  the 
commercial  enterprises  of  the  government,  was  published  in  1953.  This  report 
also included recommendation regarding some of the principles that should be 
followed  by  the  government  in  developing  the  industrial  sector.  These  reports 
were very helpful in developing the government policy on industry. Accordingly, 
the government policy on  industries was  declared  in  year  1954. It  included  the 
policy of making government intervention in setting up small industries rather 
than  large-scale  ones  and  encouraging  the  private  sector  to  establish  other 
industries.  The  government  policy  that  was  prepared  based  on  these  facts  for 
attracting  foreign  investments  into  the  country  was  explained  through  a  White 
Paper that was presented to parliament in 1955. Accordingly, doors were opened 
for the private sector, too, to invest in setting up industries in this country. Some 
of  the  significant  events  that  took  place  in  the  industrial  sector  of  this  country 
after 1956 were as follows:
 ² establishment of the first industrial estate in Ekala in 1959, and the establishment 

of Ratmalana industrial estate in 1960,

143

 ² setting  up  of  industries  such  as  iron  and  steel,  plywood,  and  sugar  with  the 
intervention of the government under the ten-year project of 1958 – 1968,
 ² development of cottage and small-scale industries during the period from 1970 
to 1977 because there was more focus on making alternative products in place 
of imported ones. 

There was a rapid development in the garment industry sector and in export oriented 
industries because of the policies adopted by the government after 1977 to attract 
investors and to encourage the private sector to develop export oriented industries.

Development of the Education Sector

When compared with the other countries of the South Asian region, there has been 
a remarkable development in the education sector and the literacy of this country 
during the period of about four decades after independence. The main factor that 
contributed to this development was the free education policy of the government or 
the policy of providing free education from Grade 1 of school up to completion of 
university education. The free education policy, which was introduced by C.W.W. 
Kannangara during the period of State Council, was continuously implemented by 
all the governments that came into power after independence.

Fig. 6.9 University of Peradeniya

The following are some of the steps taken by the government to develop the education 
sector of this country:  
 ² providing funds for the establishment of government schools and expansion of 

education

 ² development of curricula and modernizing of teacher training activities
 ² expansion of school laboratory facilities and library facilities

144

 ² developing students’ welfare – Under this, steps have been taken to provide all 
students  with  the  mid-day  meal,  school  textbooks,  school  uniform  material, 
and medical and dental facilities free of charge. Action has also been taken to 
provide transport facilities at concessionary rates.

 ² expanding the education sector by establishing vocational education institutes,
 ² establishing the University of Ceylon in Colombo in 1942,
 ² shifting the University of Ceylon to Peradeniya in 1952, 
 ² establishing the University of Moratuwa in Katubedda in 1972,
 ² establishing the University of Jaffna in 1974,
 ² awarding the Mahapola Scholarship and the bursary to university students
 ² establishing the open university for school leavers and for those who were not 

qualified to enter the university to receive higher education  

Social Welfare

Under the rule of the British, sufficient attention was not paid towards the social welfare 
of this country. During that period measures were taken to develop the education 
and health sectors. Further, the government paid its attention towards prevention of 
diseases, improvement of the nutrition of people, and renovation of the irrigation 
systems in order to address the issues that arose from time to time. However, more 
attention was drawn towards improving public welfare during the period of State 
Council (1931 – 1947) due to reasons such as granting of universal franchise in 1931 
and the appointment of Lankan Ministers for a numbers of ministries related to the 
fields of welfare. After gaining independence in 1948, powers of government were 
vested in Lankans and the politicians got the opportunity to develop and implement 
policies to improve the welfare of people. Although the governments changed from 
time to time after gaining independence, every government that came into power 
has continued to implement the welfare policy. The following are some of the key 
features of the welfare activities that were implemented after 1948: 

Improving healthcare facilities;
 ² establishing new medical colleges in order to produce the doctors required for 

the country, developing the services of the specialist doctors and nurses.

 ² developing hospitals, developing operation theatre facilities, establishing new 
hospitals, implementing immunization and disease prevention programmes

 ² developing the midwifery and maternal care services
 ² expanding the dentists’ service
 ² appointing health inspectors covering all areas of the country 

145

Providing subsidies

From  the  time  of  the  colonial  rule,  a  considerable  part  of  the  population  of  this 
country has been low income earners due to reasons such as inequality in income 
distribution,  dearth  of  lands,  lack  of  sufficient  employment  opportunities,  and 
indebtedness  of  people  in  rural  areas.  Therefore,  there  arose  the  need  to  provide 
subsidies to improve the living conditions of the low income earners. Some of the 
programmes implemented for that were as follows:
 ² providing the rice subsidy,
 ² implementing a ration card system to provide food items,
 ² providing housing aid and constructing new houses for low income earners,   
 ² providing financial aid to small land owners to cultivate crops such as tea and 

rubber.

Development of Facilities in Rural Areas

By the time when Sri Lanka gained independence, a majority of the population had 
been living in rural areas and, when compared to urban area, the facilities available 
in rural areas were minimal. Therefore, every government took steps to improve the 
living conditions of rural people. The following are some of the examples of such 
steps:

 ² developing the road system in rural areas and commencing new bus services in 

those areas,

 ² providing electricity supply to rural areas,
 ² implementing various programmes to provide drinking water to rural people,
 ² expanding postal and telecommunication facilities to rural areas, and
 ² introducing co-operative shops and banking services to rural areas.

Being innovative, changing with right knowledge 
Be a light to the country as well as to the world. 

Message from the Hon. Minister of Education 

The past two decades have been significant in the world history due to changes that took 
place  in  technology.  The  present  students  face  a  lot  of  new  challenges  along  with  the  rapid 
development of Information Technology, communication and other related fields. The manner 
of  career  opportunities  are  liable  to  change  specifically  in  the  near  future.  In  such  an 
environment,  with  a  new  technological  and  intellectual  society,  thousands  of  innovative  career 
opportunities would be created. To win those challenges, it is the responsibility of  the Sri Lankan 
Government and myself, as the Minister of Education, to empower you all.  

This book is a product of free education. Your aim must be to use this book properly and 
acquire  the  necessary  knowledge  out  of  it.  The  government  in  turn  is  able  to  provide  free 
textbooks to you, as a result of the commitment and labour of your parents and elders. 

Since we have understood that the education is crucial in deciding the future of a country, 
the  government  has  taken  steps  to  change  curriculum  to  suit  the  rapid  changes  of  the 
technological  world.  Hence,  you  have  to  dedicate  yourselves  to  become  productive  citizens.  I 
believe that the knowledge this book provides will suffice your aim.  

It  is  your  duty  to  give  a  proper  value  to  the  money  spent  by  the  government  on  your 
education.  Also  you  should  understand  that  education  determines  your  future.  Make  sure  that 
you reach the optimum social stratum through education. 

I  congratulate  you  to  enjoy  the  benefits  of  free  education  and  bloom  as  an  honoured 

citizen who takes the name of Sri Lanka to the world.

Foreword

The educational objectives of the contemporary world are becoming more complex 
along  with  the  economic,  social,  cultural  and  technological  development.  The 
learning  and  teaching  process  too  is  changing  in  relation  to  human  experiences, 
technological  differences,  research  and  new  indices.  Therefore,  it  is  required  to 
produce  the  textbook  by  including  subject  related  information  according  to  the 
objectives in the syllabus in order to maintain the teaching process by organizing 
learning experiences that suit to the learner needs. The textbook  is  not  merely a 
learning  tool  for  the  learner.  It  is  a  blessing  that  contributes  to  obtain  a  higher 
education along with a development of conduct and attitudes, to develop values and 
to obtain learning experiences.

The government in its realization of the concept of free education has offered you 
all the textbooks from grades 1-11. I would like to remind you that you should make 
the maximum use of these textbooks and protect them well. I sincerely hope that 
this textbook would assist you to obtain the expertise to become a virtuous citizen 
with a complete personality who would be a valuable asset to the country.

I would like to bestow my sincere thanks on the members of the editorial and writer 
boards as well as on the staff of the Educational Publications Department who have 
strived to offer this textbook to you.

Computer specifications

What are computer specifications?

Before purchasing an item, it is important to be aware of the value and the 
quality of the item. Specifications are generally about the common features of an 
item. 

For example, length, width and paper thickness, etc. determine quality of an 

exercise book. Basic specifications for an exercise book are as shown. 

Basic specifications for an exercise book 

    : 210 mm
    : 148 mm

Length    
Width 
Number of pages     : 40
Thickness of paper   : 60 GSM
Type  

    : Single ruled 

Similar to the specification of a book, a computer also has its specification.

Specifications to suit different user requirements

Consider a situation where two students use two types of books for different 
purposes. For example, a square ruled exercise book for mathematics and a large 
size drawing book for art. Specifications for the two types mentioned above are as 
follows: 

Specifications for an exercise book 

Specifications for a drawing book

Length

Width  
Number of pages    : 20
Thickness of paper    : 70 GSM
Type   

        : Blank

Different specifications for different purposes may result in price differences 

as well. 

The  specifications  change  according  to  user  requirements  in  the  above 
example.  Similarly  depending  on  the  use  of  a  computer  its  specifications  also 
differs.

1.5

Specifications of computers and peripheral 
devices 

The following shows some important factors of computer specifications;

Important  -  One  can  generally  assure  the  quality  of  an  item 
through its specifications.

1.5.1 The processor 

Humans  are  considered  the  most  intelligent 
among all living beings. The brain (Figure 1.4) helps 
man to make decisions for actions taken. The brain 
also has the ability to swiftly respond to all sensations.

Much  as  the  brain  is  most  important  for  humans,  the  processor  (Central 
Processing  Unit)  (Figure  1.5)  is  the  most  important  part  of  a  computer.  The 
processor processes data swiftly. As such, the processor is considered the "Brain" 
of the computer. 

The side that connects to the mother 
board

View from above

Figure. 1.5 : Central Processing Unit

Speed of the processor 

A machine functions at a slower speed takes a longer time to complete a 
task while a machine functions at a higher speed takes a shorter or a lesser time 
to complete a task. Therefore, the amounts of work that could be carried out using 
these machines during a unit time differs.

 Blender working at slower speed

Figure  1.6  shows  two  blenders  working  simultaneously.  The  blender 
working at higher speed processes a larger quantity of fruit juice per unit time. A 
machine working at a higher speed provides better results.

The performance of a computer depends on the speed of the processor. A 
processor running at high speed is able to process more data during a unit time. 
That is, the performance of the computer is increases. Then the software can be run 
faster. Therefore, when selecting a processor, it is advisable to select one with a 
greater speed. 

The  speed  of  the  processor  is  measured  by  the  number  of  instructions 

executed per second. 

Important  -  The  speed  of  a  computer  is  determined  by  the 
number of instructions execute per second. 

The speed is measured in Hertz (units such as MHz or GHz).

1000 MHz = 1 GHz

Processor manufacturers

Several  processor  manufacturing 
Intel  and  AMD 

companies,  Apple, 
(Advanced Micro Devices) exists.

Types of processors

Figure 1.7 : Different processors

Generally, the number of processors  in a central processing unit is used to 
classify the Central Processing Unit. The following table shows examples of some 
Intel Central Processing Units with multiple processor units.

1.5.2 Hard disk

The  hard  disk  provides  permanent  storage  space  for  storing  data  and  to 
installing  all  software.  The  hard  disk  is  the  main  secondary  storage  device  in  a 
computer.

For example, an exercise book with 160 pages provide more writing space 
than a book with 40 pages. Similarly, more data can be stored in a hard disk with a 
greater storage capacity. (see figure 1.8).

1.5.3 The monitor display

The main output device of a computer is its monitor display. Most often, a 

user interacts with a computer via its monitor/ display.

Monitor size

For examples, a wall clock is larger than a wrist watch. Time is easily seen on 

a wall clock because of its size. Similarly, larger monitors have better visibility.

A larger monitor size is useful in viewing a larger picture. The monitor size 

is measured in terms of its diagonal length in inches. (Figure 1.9).

19 inch

Figure. 1.9 : Monitor Size

Monitor technology

Monitors  can  be  classified  into  the  following  types  according  to  the 

technology used by them:

 ² CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) Monitor
 ² LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) Monitor
 ² LED (Light Emitting Diode) Monitor

CRT monitors consume more electricity than the other two types. Further 
they are heavier and occupy more space due to its size. Hence, light weight LED 
and LCD monitors which consume less electricity are commonly used today. (See 
figure 1.10).

1.5.4

Main memory

Let us consider a shelf which is used to keep books and bags when entering 
a library (See figure 1.11). Students who enter the library keep their school bags in 
compartments. They takes their bags as they leave the library. 

In a similar manners data and instructions are stored temporarily in the main 
memory (See figure 1.12) when the computer functions. A bigger rack for storage 
in  a  library  can  hold  more  school  bags.  Similarly,  a  higher  capacity  in  the  main 
memory  stores  more  data  and  instructions.  Therefore,  a  computer  with  a  higher 
main memory capacity is better.

units of bits. (Mega Bite (MB) or Giga Bite (GB) etc).

1024 MB = 1 GB

Refer to workbook for activity 1.5.

1.5.5 Video Graphic Adapter (VGA)

The  Monitor  is  the  main  output 
device  of  a  computer.  The  output  is  fed  to  
the  monitor  via  the Video  Graphic Adapter 
(VGA).  There  are  two  types  of  Video 
Graphic  Adapter  (VGAs).  On  board  VGA  
is  fixed  to  the  mother  board  and  Separate 
VGAs  card  can  be  fixed  to  mother  board 
manually.  The  separate  VGA  card  has  a 
separate video memory and a processor. Separate VGA cards are useful for playing 
computer games.

Figure 1.13 : VGA card

Modern  computers  use  DV1  or  HDMI  ports  instead  of  VGA  port  (See  Figure 
1.14).

Figure 1.14 : Types of video ports

When  HDMI  cables  are  connected  to  a  computer,  a  television  screen  or 
multi media projector, both sound and video signals are transmitted. When a VGA 
is used for the same purpose, only images are transmitted and a separate cable is 
required for sound.

1.5.6 Sound cards

Many  computer  are  widely  used  for  entertainment  today. A  sound  card  is 
required for listening to music and recording audio. A microphone connected to the 
sound card can be used to record (input) sounds while a speaker connected to the 
sound card can be used to play (output) sounds.

Most computers have the sound card built into the motherboard (See figure 

1.15). A user can also connect external sound card to the computer if necessary.

1.5.7 Pre-Installed software

An  operating  system  provides  the  interface  between  the  user  and  the 
hardware. The operating system is essential to run application software. Once the 
operating system is installed in a computer, the necessary application software can 
be installed.

Free  and  open  source  operating  systems  such  as  Linux,  Ubuntu  can  be 
obtained free of charge. Licensed operating systems such as Windows 8, Windows 
10  to  purchase. A  trial  version  of  an  operating  systems  such  as  trail  version  of 
Windows 10 can be used only for a limited period. Required application software 
depends on the requirement of the user. 

In buying a desktop computer or a laptop computer it is important to check 
whether an operating system has been pre-installed. Most often only DOS or LINUX 
computer systems are pre-installed. A computer with licensed software installed is 
more expensive than a computer with a free and open source operating system.

1.6

Non-technical features to be considered in 
purchasing a computer

Non-technical specifications such as manufacturer, type of book and price 
are considered in purchasing an exercise book. This applies to the purchase of a 
computer as well. Therefore, in purchasing a computer, non-technical specification 
must also be considered.

1.6.1

Warranty 

Warranty  is  an  important  factor  to  be  considered  when  purchasing  a 
computer. Warranty given by the vendor and the manufacturer assurers to cover the 
defects for a certain period. Customer can get this warranty in many different ways.

a. Manufacturer warranty

The  warranty  which  is  given  by  the  manufacturing 
company  is  known  as  the  manufacturer  warranty.  If  the  device 
malfunctions  during  the  warranty  period,  it  is  either  repaired  or 
replaced with a new one.

b. Extended warranty

Extended  warranty  is  a  prolonged  warranty  given  to 
customers in addition to the standard warranty. Customer needs 
bearing additional cost for extended warranty.

c. On-site warranty

If  a  customer  obtains  an  on-site  warranty,  technicians 
from the respective company visit the place of work to repair the 
product. They generally maintain, replace faulty parts and examine 
the operations of the machine. 

There is a standard warranty when purchasing a computer. 
but, the warranty for the parts of the computer may differ from the 
standard.  

For  instance,  a  laptop  computer  with  standard  warranty  for  3  years,  may 

have only one year warranty for the battery.

1.6.2

Price

The price of a computer can vary according to the customer requirements.  

e.g.

1.  The price of a computer is rather high with a high speed processor.

2.  A computer with a large monitor is comparatively high in price.

3.  Price is low of a computer with a lesser memory capacity.

4.  A computer inclusive high capacity hard disk drive is high in price.

It is advisable to compare prices to suit one’s requirements from different 

places and select the computer with the lowest price.

Refer to workbook for Activities 1.6 and 1.7

Important - It is not advisable to purchase a computer considering 
only its price.

1.6.3 Services after-sale

Computer sales centers provide the following after-sales services to customers;

1. Technical advice

2. Technical assistance

3. Telephone, e-mail and website information (i.e. contact information) of the 
    vendor

It is advisable for a user to consider the given information in purchasing a 
computer.  Customer  needs  preparing  specifications  first. Then,  a  computer  must 
be  bought  from  a  vendor  with  a  reputed  name  and  must  be  from  a  recognized 
manufacturer.

3.1

Simple selection

You learnt in programming chapter of Grade 
8, ICT textbook that a simple selection is selecting 
one option out of two given options under a certain 
condition.  For  example,  one  such  choice  is  the 
selection of “head” or “tail” with the toss of a coin. 

Head and tail of a coin

Start

Toss the coin

Is it head?

No

Show it is 'tails'

End

Yes 

Show it is 
'head'

Simple selection has one condition with two options. A selection is made 
out of the two conditions. If the condition is true, one option is selected and if not, 
the other option gets selected.

Refer to workbook for Activity 3.1.

3.2

Selection out of many options

Selection out of many options is about selecting one out of more than two 

options.

Example   Tossing a dice for values of 1 to 6

Start

Toss the dice

Get the value

Is value 1?

No

Is value 2?  

No

Is value 3?

In  the  above,  a  number  will  be  displayed  if  one  of  the  five  conditions  is 

satisfied or if non of the five conditions is satisfied.

3.3

Control structure with repetition 

Repetition  is  about  an  action  getting 

repeated again and again.

With  repetition,  both  beginning  and 

end is based on a condition.

Example 1   Displaying numbers 1 - 5

Begin

Number = 1

Is the 
number 5 or 
less than 5? 

Yes 
Show number

No

End

Add 1 to number

   Flowchart 3 : Display numbers 1 - 5

In  this  flowchart  the  condition 
is,  “Is  the  number  equals  5  or 
less than 5”?

At  the  beginning,  condition  is 
checked and since the condition 
is  true,  the  repetitive  work 
commences.

Once the number is shown, 1 is 
added to it and the condition is 
checked again. 

When the number exceeds five, 
condition  is  not  satisfied  and 
the repetition ends.

Programming with arrays

What is an array?  

In  Grade  7,  we  learnt  that  to  store  values  in  programming,  variables  are 
needed. We need a number of variables that is equivalent to the number of values to 
be stored. 

For example, consider storing marks gained by a student for five question 

papers on general knowledge.

Five variables are required to store marks for the five question papers. 

Name the variable as marks _ 1, marks _ 2, marks _ 3. marks _ 4 and marks 
_ 5. Marks earned by a student can be stored in these variables. Consider 78, 85, 69, 
93, 87 to be the marks scored. 

78

85

69

93

87

marks_1

marks_2

marks_3

marks_4

marks_5

Each variable needs giving a name when variables are used to store values. 
This is difficult when a large number of variables are used. Further, the program 
become complicated and large with large number of variables. In such instances, 
arrays are used to get over this problem.  

An array is a data structure that can store any number of items using a single 
variable name. By using arrays, programs become less complex and the number of 
instructions can be reduced.

Building up arrays

Lists are used for arrays in Scratch. Lists can be built as follows in Scratch. 

e.g. - Using arrays to enter names of animals:

1.  Select ‘Make a List’ from data

2.  Give array a name

3.  Select ‘For this sprite only’

4.  Click 'OK'

After  following  the  steps  above,  instructions  blocks  for Animal  array  appear  as 
shown below;

Assigning items into arrays

For example, after building an array named 'Country' to enter the names of 

five countries, the following code can be used to enter items to it.

 Scratch program 13

Displaying items in an array

After entering data into an array named ‘Country’, the following program 

can be used to display its content to produce the output.

Scratch program 14

In the above program, v_con is a variable and ''Country'' is the name of the array.

Let us consider an example where two Scratch programs to store the names 
and the marks of five students are processed. The first one uses multiple variables 
whereas the second one uses two arrays.

With the arrays in use, it is possible to use a repetition construct. This helps reduce 
the size of the program.  

Note - An array is termed a list in Scratch programming.

Let us consider another example;

A  school  conducted  a  competition  to  select  students  for  a  general  knowledge 
contest. The principal decided to select students who gained over 15 marks for the 
interview.

Five students are to face the interview. In the code shown below, using two arrays 
named 'Name' and 'Marks' the names of students having marks greater than 75 are 
shown.

Programming with problem analysis

Dividing a problem into sections makes it easier to solve. 

For  example,  Let  us  consider  finding  the  average  of  ten  numbers.  This 

problem can be divided into sections as shown below;

1. Input ten numbers.

Summary

 ² Repetition is about repeating a statement or a set of statements.
 ² A condition is necessary to begin and end a repetition.
 ² There are Scratch repetition control structures.
 ² There are three repetition control structures in Scratch:

i.  Control structure for repetition a set number of  

times (e.g. for 10 times)

ii.  Control  structure  for  repetition  based  on  a  

condition

iii.  Control structure for endless repetition

 ² Repetition  within  a  repetition  is  called  a  nested 

repetition.

 ² There are a few nested repetition types:

i  Repetition to satisfy a given condition

ii.  Continuous repetition a fixed number of times

iii.  Continuous  repetition 

to  satisfy  a  given 

condition

 ² An array is a data structure to store many items using a single name.
 ² Dividing  a  problem  into  smaller  selections  makes  problem  development 

easier.

Identifying devices that use sensors
Introducing the control of processing and output of data collected from 
sensors and developing codes for the purpose.

Microcontrollers

The sun is up. Yet, the 
street lights are on.
Isn’t it a crime to waste 
electricity?

True. We can minimize the 
loss. To do so, we could use 
a light sensor to detect sun 
rise and sun set and based 
on that the lights could be 
automatically switched on 
and off. 

I haven’t heard of 
such light sensors. 
How are they 
controlled?

For free distribution

47

 
There are sensors to measure 
things like soil conditions, 
temperature and environmental 
conditions and many such. 
Specialized computer programs 
could be used to control them. 

Use of sensors to identify environmental changes

To  use  sensors  to  detect  environmental  conditions  and  to  set  related 

information, they must be connected to a computer.  

The basic functions of a computer are to input or collect data, process data 

according the given instructions and to output necessary information.

Components of microcontroller

A microcontroller consists of four basic components;

1. Central Processing Unit - CPU

    This processes data into information in order to provide the output.

2. Memory

    There are two types; 

i.  Non-volatile memory

The data in the non-volatile memory does not get erased even if 
there is no electricity. The program that the microcontroller should execute 
is stored in it.
       ii. Volatile memory

Data in the volatile memory gets erased if there is no electricity. 
It functions as the Random Access Memory (RAM). This is used to store 
data as well as other results that are related when the microcontroller is at 
work. Data and instructions for the CPU are also held here.

3. System clock

The  system  clock  is  an  electronic  device.  It  synchronizes  all 

components.

4. Peripheral devices

Small pins used to input data or output information belong to this 
category. Data is collected in both in analog and digital forms. Output is 
released in digital form.

Use of sensors and micro controllers

Solar lamp

This  contains  solar  cells,  sensors  and 
microcontroller.  Solar  cells  microcontroller  and 
light sensors cooperate to light the lamp. The solar 
lamp turns on automatically with the dark and turns 
off when there is light. Use of such solar lamps can 
minimize the waste of electricity. 

Washing machine

Pressing buttons, the user gives instructions to 
the microcontroller for the wash. The microcontroller 
operates accordingly.

Microwave oven 

The microcontroller in the microwave oven 
holds  the  heat  for  a  specified  period  and  stops.  
The  user  has  to  instruct  regarding  the  required 
temperature and the duration.

Important: 

Single Board Computer (SBC) 

A single-board computer has a single circuit board with memory, 

input, output and microcontroller. 

e.g. - Raspberry pi

The  server  manages 
the 
hardware,  the  files  and  communication  in 
the network. Any ordinary computer with the 
necessary software installed can be used as a 
server.

The switch acts as the mediator between two 
or  more  computers.  The  switch  recognizes 
the  destination  computer  or  the  device  when 
messages  are  sent  from  one  computer  to 
another in the network. 

e.g.-  when  printing  command  is  given  from 
one  computer  that  message  is  sent  to 
the  relevant  device  i.e.  the  printer  via 
switch.

Advantages of using peripherals in common

 ² Ability to use common hardware with several computers
 ² Saving money
 ² Saving time

e.g. 2 - Sharing software 

Each  stand-alone  computer  may  need  individual  software  licenses.  This 
is  very  expensive.  However,  buying  multiuser  software  licenses  for  a  computer 
network is relatively low. This saves a lot of money.

e.g. 3 - Sharing data and information

Sharing data and information helps save time, money and storage capacity 

while increasing the efficiency and productivity.

File folder

When a folder is shared in a network, all the files in 
the folder can be accessed by the users in the network.

This provides an opportunity to share images, photos, 
songs and videos, etc. among friends.

Note - Command Line Interface (CLI)

The  command  Line  Interface  is  an 
interface  that  could  be  used  to  give  typed 
commands to computer sequentially in the form 
of texts. Before the introduction of the Graphical 
User  Interface,  the  operating  system  of  the 
computer, had the command line interface. This 
interface can be used to send messages to the network users.

In addition, the third party software such as LAN messages, Net send 

GUI, POP Messenger, also could be used for network user communications.

Foreword  

The  educational  objectives  of  the  contemporary  world  are  becoming  more  complex  along 

with the economic, social, cultural and technological development. The learning and teaching 

process too is changing in relation to human experiences, technological differences, research 

and new indices. Therefore, it is required to produce the textbook by including subject related 

information  according  to  the  objectives  in  the  syllabus  in  order  to  maintain  the  teaching 

process by organizing learning experiences that suit to the learner needs. The textbook is not 

merely  a  learning  tool  for  the  learner.  It  is  a  blessing  that  contributes  to  obtain  a  higher 

education along with a development of conduct and attitudes, to develop values and to obtain 

learning experiences. 

The  government  in  its  realization  of  the  concept  of  free  education  has  offered  you  all  the 

textbooks from grades 1-11. I would like to remind you that you should make the maximum 

use of these textbooks and protect them well. I sincerely hope that this textbook would assist 

you  to  obtain  the  expertise  to  become  a  virtuous  citizen  with  a  complete  personality  who 

would be a valuable asset to the country. 

I would like to bestow my sincere thanks on the members of the editorial and writer boards as 

well as on the staff of the Educational Publications Department who have strived to offer this 

textbook to you.

Using functions    
To calculate the values in a range of cells, functions are used. After the ''='' 
symbol, to begin a formula, the function is included. Then the cell range is 
included within brackets. To indicate that it is a cell range, the names of the 
ﬁ rst cell and the last cell are written within and the symbol '':''.

Let us identify a few such functions;

To calculate the total sum in a cell range
= sum(ﬁ rst cell:last cell).

To ﬁ nd the average in a cell range,  
= average(ﬁ rst cell:last cell).

To count the cells with numbers only 
= count(ﬁ rst cell:last cell).

To count cells with data in a cell range, use 
= counta(ﬁ rst cell:last cell).

Foreword 

The educational objectives of the contemporary world are becoming more 
complex along with the economic, social, cultural and technological development. 
The learning and teaching process too is changing in relation to human experiences, 
technological  differences,  research  and  new  indices.  Therefore,  it  is  required  to 
produce  the  textbook  by  including  subject  related  information  according  to  the 
objectives in the syllabus in order to maintain the teaching process by organizing 
learning  experiences  that  suit  to  the  learner  needs.  The  textbook  is  not  merely 
a  learning  tool  for  the  learner.  It  is  a  blessing  that  contributes  to  obtain  a  higher 
education along with a development of conduct and attitudes, to develop values and 
to obtain learning experiences.

The government in its realization of the concept of free education has offered 
you all the textbooks from grades 1-11. I would like to remind you that you should 
make the maximum use of these textbooks and protect them well. I sincerely hope 
that  this  textbook  would  assist  you  to  obtain  the  expertise  to  become  a  virtuous 
citizen with a complete personality who would be a valuable asset to the country.

I would like to bestow my sincere thanks on the members of the editorial 
and writer boards as well as on the staff of the Educational Publications Department 
who have strived to offer this textbook to you.

Number Patterns

By studying this lesson you will be able to;
²  develop the general term of a number pattern with the same difference between 

adjacent terms,

²  develop the number pattern when the general term is known,
²  solve problems associated with number patterns.

Introduction to number patterns 
Introduction to number patterns 

Several number patterns are given below.

i.   3, 3, 3, 3, 3, ...

ii.   2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...

iii.   5, 8, 11, 14, 17, ...

iv.   2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...

v.   1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, ...

vi.   1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, ... 

The first number pattern is very simple. Every number of this number pattern is 3.
While the first number of the second number pattern is 2, all the numbers thereafter 
are obtained by adding 2 to the previous number.

While the first number of the third number pattern is 5, all the numbers thereafter 
are obtained by adding 3 to the previous number.

While the first number of the fourth number pattern is 2, all the numbers thereafter 
are obtained by multiplying the previous number by 2.

The fifth and sixth number patterns have characteristics which are inherent to them.

The numbers of a number pattern are called “terms”. 

For example, each term of the first number pattern is 3.

1

                        for free distribution 
 
The first term of the second number pattern is 2, the second term is 4, the third term 
is 6, etc. In this pattern, each term which comes after the first term is obtained by 
adding 2 to the previous term.

The first term of the third number pattern is 5, the second term is 8, the third term 
is 11, etc. In this pattern, each term which comes after the first term is obtained by 
adding 3 to the previous term.

In the fourth number pattern, each term which comes after the first term is obtained 
by multiplying the previous term by 2.

The ways in which the terms of the fifth and sixth number patterns are obtained can 
also be described as above. However, the descriptions will be more complicated.

Observe that the terms of the number patterns given above are separated by commas 
and that there are three dots (ellipsis) at the end of each number pattern. This is how 
number patterns are usually written. The three dots indicate that the number pattern 
continues. 

In mathematics, the word “sequence” is used for the word “pattern”. 
Accordingly, six “number sequences” (or simply “sequences”) are given above. 
The order of the terms of a sequence is important. 

For example, although the sequence 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, ... 
and the sequence 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 6, ... consist of the same numbers, they 
are two different sequences.

In the above examples of sequences, only a few initial terms are given. However, it 
is incorrect to presume the pattern of the sequence by considering only a few initial 
terms.
For example,

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...

is a number pattern; that is, a sequence. If only the first five terms of the sequence 
are given (that is, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, …), and a person is asked what the next term is, one 
may be provided with the incorrect answer 6. Hence, asking for the next term (or 
next few terms) after giving only the first few terms of a sequence is mathematically 
incorrect. 

A method of describing a sequence accurately is by providing a rule by which each 
term of the sequence can be calculated. 

2

  for free distributionThe  uniqueness  (or  characteristic)  of  the  second  and  third  sequences  of  the  six 
sequences given above can be explained as follows.

In the second sequence, every term which comes after the first term is obtained by 
adding the constant value 2 to the previous term. This can be illustrated as follows.

4

6

8

10

+2

+2

+2

In the third sequence, every term which comes after the first term is obtained by 
adding the constant value 3 to the previous term. This can be illustrated as follows.

11

14

17

+3

+3

+3

+3

Here, the meaning of “constant value” is “the value remains unchanged”. 

The  characteristic  which  is  common  to  both  these  patterns  can  be  described  as 
follows.

“The value obtained by subtracting the previous term from any term (except the 
first term) is a constant (that is, a constant value).”

The value of this constant is 2 for the sequence 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, …
(since 4 − 2 = 6 − 4 = 8 − 6 = 10 − 8 = 2).

The value of this constant is 3 for the sequence 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, …
(since 8 − 5 = 11 − 8 = 14 − 11 = 17 − 14 = 3).

Let us study further about sequences of which the difference between every pair of 
consecutive terms is a constant value. 

This constant value is known as the common difference of the sequence. Accordingly, 

common difference = any term except the first term – the previous term

3

                        for free distribution 
It can be seen that the first sequence 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, … also has the same characteristic.

Here, the constant value added (that is the common difference) is 0. 

Another sequence with the same characteristic is given below.

12

7

2

− 3...

−5

−5

−5

−5

The first term of this sequence is 17. Every term which comes thereafter is obtained 
by subtracting 5 from the previous term. That is, by adding −5 to the previous term. 
Accordingly, the common difference of this sequence is −5. 

Common difference = 12 − 17 = 7 − 12 = 2 − 7 = −3 − 2 = −5.   

If  the  value  of  the  common  difference  and  the  first  term  of  a  sequence  with  a 
common difference are known, the first few terms of the sequence can be written 
easily. A couple of examples of such sequences are given below.

Example 1  

The first three terms of the sequence with first term 4 and common difference 3 are 
4, 7 and 10. 

Example 2  

The first five terms of the sequence with first term 7 and common difference − 4 
are 7, 3. −1, −5 and −9.

The first few terms of a sequence with a common difference can be written easily, 
when the first term and common difference are given. But it is not so easy to find, 
say the 50th term or the 834th term. The reason is because 50 and 834 are fairly 
large numbers.  
It is important to know the general term of a sequence to be able to find any term of 
the sequence easily. Now let us see what is meant by the general term.

  for free distributionThe general term of a number pattern
The general term of a number pattern

First, let us introduce a specific notation to denote the terms of a sequence. For a 
given sequence, let us denote

the first term by T1,
the second term by T2,
the third term by T3, etc.

For example, with regard to the sequence

5, 11, 17, 23, ...

we can indicate the terms as follows:

the first term, T1 = 5
the second term, T2 = 11
the third term, T3 = 17
the fourth term, T4 = 23

It is very important to consider the nth term of a sequence, as is usually done in 
mathematics. Here, n represents any positive integer. The reason for this is that the 
values n can assume are positive integers such as 1, 2, 3, ... . The   1
th term, the 
2
−4th term, the 3.5th term, etc., have no meaning. When considering a value n, the 
corresponding  nth  term  is  denoted  by  Tn. This  is  called  the  general  term  of  the 
sequence. Accordingly,

the general term (nth term) of a sequence is denoted by  Tn.

1.1 Developing the number sequence when the general term is
1.1 Developing the number sequence when the general term is
      given
      given

In the previous section we learnt the notation that is used to denote the terms of a 
sequence, in particular, the general term. Now, through a couple of examples, let us 
consider how to develop the number sequence and how to find a named term of the 
sequence, when the general term is given.

5

                        for free distributionExample 1  
Consider the number sequence with general term Tn =  2n + 3.
(i) Write the first three terms of this sequence.
(ii) Find the 20th term. 
(iii) Which term is equal to 123?
(iv) Find the (n + 1)th term in terms of n.

(i) Since the general term Tn = 2n + 3,
when n = 1; the first term T1= (2 × 1) + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5,
when n = 2; the second term T2 = (2 × 2) + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7,
when n = 3; the third term T3 = (2 × 3) + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9.
Therefore, the first three terms of this number pattern are 5, 7, 9.

(ii) The 20th term is obtained by substituting n = 20 in 2n + 3.

The 20th term, T20 = (2 × 20) + 3 = 40 + 3

= 43

Therefore, the 20th term is 43.

(iii) Let us assume that the nth term is 123.

Then, 2n + 3 = 123 

2n + 3 – 3 = 123 – 3

2n = 120
120
n =  2
= 60

Therefore, 123 is the 60th term of the number pattern.

(iv) In order to obtain the (n + 1)th term, let us substitute (n + 1) for n.
The (n + 1)th term, 

Tn + 1  = 2 (n + 1) + 3

= 2n + 2 + 3
= 2n + 5

Therefore, the (n + 1)th term, in terms of n, is 2n + 5.

Example 2  
Consider the number pattern with general term Tn = 56 – 4n.
(i) Write the first three terms of this number pattern.
(ii) Find the 12th term.
(iii) Show that 0 is a term of this number pattern.
(iv) Show that 18 is not a term of this number pattern.

(i) Since the general term  Tn = 56 – 4n,
when n = 1; the first term T1 = 56 – (4 × 1)  = 56 – 4 = 52
when n = 2; the second term T2 = 56 – (4 × 2) = 56 – 8 = 48
when n = 3; the third term  T3 = 56 – (4 × 3)  = 56 – 12 = 44
Therefore, the first three terms of the number pattern are 52, 48, 44.

(ii)The 12th term = 56 – 4 × 12

= 56 – 48
= 8

(iii) If 0 is a term of the number pattern, then for some integer n, we have

56 – 4n = 0. 

∴ 56 – 4n + 4n = 4n (adding 4n to both sides)

4n
56
 =  4
4
14 = n

n = 14     

The  14th  term  of  the  number  pattern  is  0.Therefore  0  is  a  term  of  this  number 
pattern.

(iv) If 18 is a term of this number pattern, then for some integer n, we have                   

        56 – 4n = 18. 
Then, 56 – 4n + 4n = 18 + 4n

56 – 18 = 18 – 18 + 4n 

38 = 4n 
1
 = n
9 2

If 18 is a term of this number pattern, the value of n should be a whole number. 
1
Since n = 9 2

, 18 is not a term of this number pattern.

1.2  Obtaining an expression for the general term (Tn) 

In the previous section an expression was given for the general term Tn. Our objective 
in this section, is to obtain an expression for Tn in terms of n. Then, any term of the 
sequence can easily be found by using the obtained expression. Now let us consider 
how we can develop such an expression, through an example. 
Suppose we want to find the 80th term of the sequence 5, 11, 17, 23…, which is a 
sequence with a common difference. That is, we want to find the value of T80. First, 
examine the pattern given in the following table.

n

1
2
3
4
5

Tn

5
11
17
23
29

How Tn can be written in terms of n and 
the common difference 6.
6 × 1 − 1  or 5 + 0 × 6 
6 × 2 − 1  or 5 + 1× 6 
6 × 3 − 1  or 5 + 2 × 6
6 × 4 − 1  or 5 + 3 × 6 
6 × 5 − 1  or 5 + 4 × 6

You may be wondering why the expressions 6 × 1 − 1, 6 × 2 − 1, 6 × 3 – 1, etc., 
given in the 3rd column of the table have been written. Especially, the reason why 
1 is subtracted from each term may be unclear to you. This can be explained as 
follows. 

Since the common difference of the given sequence 5, 11, 17, 23, … is 6, let us 
write the given sequence first and several multiples of 6 below it. 

5, 11, 17, 23, 29, ...

6, 12, 18, 24, 30, ...  

It  is  clear  that  the  given  sequence  can  be  obtained  by  subtracting  1  from  each 
multiple of 6.

That is,

the first term of the sequence = the first multiple of 6 – 1
the second term of the sequence = the second multiple of 6 –1
the third term of the sequence = the third multiple of 6 – 1

Accordingly, 
the nth term of the sequence = the nth multiple of 6 – 1 

∴ Tn = 6n − 1

9

                        for free distributionAccordingly, 

T80 = 6 × 80 − 1 = 479.

Therefore, the 80th term is 479.

Moreover, an expression for the general term Tn of this sequence was found above 
as Tn = 6n − 1.
We can find any term of the sequence using this expression. For example, in order 
to find the 24th term of this sequence, n has to be substituted with 24.

T24 = 6 × 24 −1 = 143 

Therefore, the 24th term of the sequence is 143. 

Let us consider another example.

Example 1  
Given that the sequence with first four terms15, 19, 23, 27 has a common difference, 
let us find an expression for the nth term. 

The common difference  = 19 − 15 = 4' 
Let us write the first few terms of the given sequence, and several multiples (positive 
integer multiples) of 4 below them.

15, 19, 23, 27, ... 
4, 8, 12, 16, ...
It is clear that the given number pattern is obtained by adding 11 to each multiple 
of 4.

Therefore, the expression for the general term Tn is given by Tn = 4n + 11. 
Let us find the 100th term using this expression. 

 T100 = 4 × 100 + 11 = 411

Now let us consider a sequence with a negative common difference, which therefore 
consists of terms which are decreasing in value.

Example 2  
Let us find an expression for the general term Tn of the sequence with a common 
difference, of which the first four terms are 10, 7, 4, 1.

The common difference of the sequence 10, 7, 4, 1, … = 7 − 10 = − 3.

10

  for free distributionTherefore, let us write the first few terms of the given sequence and a few multiples 
of −3 (integral), one below the other.

10, 7, 4, ...
− 3, − 6, − 9, ...

It  can  be  seen  that  the  terms  of  the  sequence  are  obtained  by  adding  13  to  the 
multiples of −3. Therefore, the general term can be written as 

Tn = − 3n + 13

(Or else, it can be written as Tn = 13 − 3n with the positive term first.)

For  example,  in  order  to  find  the  30th  term,  n  =  30  should  be  substituted  in  the 
expression for Tn.

 T30 = − 3 × 30 + 13 = − 77

Therefore, the 30th term is − 77.

1.3 Solving mathematical problems involving number patterns
1.3 Solving mathematical problems involving number patterns

We can solve various mathematical problems by developing number patterns using 
information that is given.

Example 1  
A long distance runner trains every day. On the first day he runs 500 m and on each 
day thereafter he runs 100 m more than on the previous day. 

 i.  Write separately the distances he runs on the first three days.
ii.  Find the general term Tn for the distance he runs on the nth day, in terms of n.
iii. Find the distance he runs on the 20th day.
iv. On which day does he run 3km?  

i.          The distance run on the first day  = 500 m

The distance run on the second day = 500 m + 100 m = 600 m

The distance run on the third day = 500 m + 100 m + 100 m = 700 m

∴ The first three terms of the number pattern are 500, 600, 700

12

  for free distributionii. Let us take the day as n.

The number pattern of the distance run by the athlete is built up by multiples 
of 100.
Therefore, the general term Tn = 100n + 400

iii. It is clear that the distance run on the 20th day is represented by the 20th term.

     The 20th term, T20 = (100 × 20) + 400

= 2000 + 400
= 2400 m
= 2.4 km

∴ The distance run on the 20th day is 2.4 km.
iv. Let us assume that 3000 m are run on the nth day.

Then, 100n + 400 = 3000
100n + 400 – 400 = 3000 – 400

100 n = 2600 
2600
100

∴ n = 

= 26
Therefore, 3km are run on the 26th day.

  Introduction

Let us recall how numbers are written in the Hindu - Arabic number system, which 
is the number system we use. 

As an example, let us consider the number 3 725. According to what we have learnt 
in previous grades,
5 denotes the number of 1s (that is, the number of 100s), 
2 denotes the number of 10s (that is, the number of 101s), 

7 denotes the number of 100s (that is, the number of 102s),

3 denotes the number of 1000s (that is, the number of 103s).

The above can be represented on an abacus as shown below.

     1000 

      100

     10 

     1 

103

102

101

100

Observe  that  the  number  3  725  can  also  be  written  in  terms  of  powers  of  10  as 
shown below.

 3 725 = 3 × 1000 + 7 × 100 + 2 × 10 + 5 × 1 

That is, 3 725 = 3 ×103 + 7 × 10 2 + 2 ×101 + 5 × 100
16

  for free distribution 
 
 
 
 
  
 
If we consider 603 as another example, we can write it as shown below.

603 = 6 × 10 2 + 0 × 10 1 + 3 × 10 0 

In the Hindu - Arabic number system which we use, the place values are powers of 
ten such as 1, 10, 100 and 1000. Moreover, we use the 10 digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 
7, 8 and 9 to write numbers in the Hindu - Arabic number system. The method of 
writing numbers using these 10 digits and assigning place values which are powers 
of ten, is called writing the numbers in “base 10”. When studying about number 
bases, these numbers are called “decimal numbers”. 

Note : 100 = 1. Similarly, any nonzero base raised to the power zero is always 
              equal to one. Accordingly, 20 = 1.

2.1  Expressing numbers in the binary number system

We can use number bases other than base ten to express numbers. For example, we 
can express numbers in “base two” by using only the digits 0 and 1, and assigning 
place values which are powers of two. To do this, let us first identify several powers 
of two. 
We can write them as;

20 = 1 
21 = 2 
22 = 4 
23 = 8 
24 = 16 

25 = 32
26 = 64
27 = 128
28 = 256
29 = 512

To understand the method of writing numbers in base two, let us first consider the 
base ten number 13 as an example. Let us see how we can write 13 as a sum of 
powers of two. 
The first few powers of two are;

1, 2, 4 and 8.

Using these numbers which are powers of two, we can write,

13 = 8 + 4 + 1

i.e., 13 = 23 + 22 + 20 

i.e., 13 = 1 × 23 + 1 × 22 + 0 × 21 + 1 × 20.

17

  for free distribution 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Here, we have written all the non - negative powers of two in descending order, 
starting  from  23 and  continuing  with  22,  21  and  20.  Also,  since  the  power  23  is 
included, it is written as 1 × 23 and since the power 21 is not included, it is written as 
0 × 21. Recall that we use only the digits 1 and 0 when writing base two numbers. 
Considering the above facts, we can write 13 as a base two number as follows. 

The digits 0 and 1 appearing in this base two number can be described as follows.

1101

1  1  0  1

23

22 21

20

We can also express it using an abacus as follows.

1

0

1

       23

      22

     21

    20

To indicate that 1101 is a base two number, we usually write “two” as a subscript 
and express the number as 1101two. In this lesson, whenever necessary, we indicate 
base  ten  numbers  with  the  subscript  “ten”  to  differentiate  the  base  two  numbers 
from  the  base  ten  numbers.  For  example,  the  decimal  number  603  is  written  as 
603ten.

Let us consider another example. Let us write the base ten number 20 ten as a base 
two number.

By recalling the powers of two, we can write; 

20 = 16 + 4 
= 24 + 22 
= 1 × 24 + 0 × 23 + 1 × 22 + 0 × 21 + 0 × 20.  

Hence,

20ten = 10100two.

There  is  an  important  fact  to  remember  here.  There  is  only  one  way  of  writing 
any  number  as  a  sum  of  distinct  descending  powers  of  two.  For  example,                                          
20 = 16 + 4 can only be written as 24 + 22 as a sum of distinct descending powers 
of two. There is no other way. You can see this for yourself by attempting to find 
a different way. Moreover, any number can be written as a sum of powers of two. 
You can verify this too by writing different decimal numbers as a sum of distinct 
powers of two.

The above method of writing a decimal number as a sum of distinct descending 
powers of two, cannot be considered as a precise method. The reason for this is 
because it is difficult to decide what powers of two add up to a number, when the 
number is large. For example, it is not easy to determine the powers of two that add 
up to the decimal number 3905ten. 

Therefore,  let  us  now  consider  another  method  that  can  be  used  to  convert  any 
decimal number to a binary number fairly easily.

Consider 22ten as an example. To write this as a binary number, we need to first 
divide 22 by 2 and write the remainder also.

222

11  remainder 0

Next we need to divide the quotient 11 which we obtained by dividing 22 by 2, 
again by 2.

      222

2 11 remainder  0
5 remainder  1

We need to continue dividing the quotient by 2  and noting down  the remainder, 
until  we  get  0  as  the  quotient  and  1  as  the  remainder.  The  complete  division  is 
shown below.

2
2

11  remainder  0
5  remainder  1
2  remainder 
1
1  remainder  0
0  remainder  1

When  the  highlighted  remainders  are  written  from  bottom  to  top,  we  obtain  the 
required base two number. 

1 0 1 1 0 two

22ten = 10110two

Let us see whether we can verify this answer using the method we discussed earlier 
of writing the number as a sum of powers of two.

22 = 16 + 4 + 2 = 24 + 22 + 21 = 1 × 24 + 0 × 23 + 1 × 22 + 1 × 21 + 0 × 20  
  = 10110two

The answer is verified.

2.2 Converting binary numbers into decimal numbers

Decimal  numbers  were  converted  into  binary  numbers  in  the  above  section  2.1. 
In this section we consider the inverse process; that is, converting binary numbers 
into decimal numbers. This can be done fairly easily.  Let us learn how to do this 
by considering an example.

In  section  2.1,  when  we  wrote  the  decimal  number  13  as  a  binary  number,  we 
obtained 1101two. Let us recall what the digits 1, 1, 0 and 1 represent.
1  1  0  1

number 
of 23s

number 
of 22s

 number 
of 21s

number 
of 20s

Therefore,  by  adding  all  the  values  of  the  powers  of  two  in  1101two  we  get  the 
corresponding decimal representation.

1 × 23 + 1 × 22 + 0 × 21 + 1 × 20 = 1 × 8 + 1 × 4 + 0 × 2 + 1 × 1 

= 8 + 4 + 1 = 13.

  for free distribution     
      
                                                     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
By simplifying, we obtain the corresponding decimal number 13.

Example 1

Write 101100two as a decimal number.

First, it should be noted that the place value of the leftmost digit of this base two 
number is 25 and that the other place values are obtained by reducing the index by 
one (starting from 5) for each move from left to right. Then the required decimal 
number can be found by multiplying each power of two (place value) by the relevant 
co-efficient and adding all the terms together.
101100two= 1× 25 + 0 ×  24 + 1 ×  23 + 1 ×  22 + 0 ×  21 + 0 ×  20 

= 25 + 23 + 22 = 32 + 8 + 4
= 44ten

Therefore, when 101100twois written in base 10 we obtain 44ten. 

Note: This answer can be verified by converting 44ten back into a binary 
           number.

2.3 Adding binary numbers

When representing binary numbers on an abacus, the maximum number of counters 
that can be placed on a rod is 1. Moreover, instead of placing two counters on a rod, 
we always place one counter on the rod to the left of it. 

Let us learn how to add binary numbers with the aid of two abacuses. 

Let us simplify 101two+ 10two .

        22

C

21

  for free distribution  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Let us represent the sum of the numbers represented on the abacuses A and B on 
the abacus C. 
When we consider the two abacuses A and B;

the sum of the counters on the 20 rods is 1,

the sum of the counters on the 21 rods is 1,

the sum of the counters on the 22 rods is 1.

Therefore, 101two + 10two = 111two

Now, let us obtain the value of 101two + 1two using the abacuses. 

         22

        A   

B 

C

The counter on the 20 rod in A and the counter on the 20 rod in B, cannot both be 
placed on the 20 rod in C, because there cannot be two counters on any rod of an 
abacus used to represent a binary number. Instead, one counter should be placed on 
the rod to the left of the 20 rod. This is shown on the rod 21 in C.

Therefore,  101two +  1two = 110two' 

This is clarified further by adding the numbers vertically.

101two
1two
+
110two

Adding from right to left; first, one 20s + one 20s = one 21s and zero 20s. 
Then, one 21s + zero 21s = one 21s. Finally, one 22s  + zero 22s = one 22s.

2.4 Subtracting binary numbers

particular position, we replaced it with 1 in the position left of it.

Now  let  us  find  the  value  of  110two−  1two  . According  to  the  above  addition,  the 
answer should be 101two . Let us consider how this answer is obtained.

We cannot subtract 1 from 0 in the rightmost column. Therefore, let us take 1 from 
the 21 column which is to the left of it.The value of this is 2 in the 20 column. Now 
we subtract 1 from this 2 to obtain 1 in the rightmost column. Now there is 0 instead 
of 1 in the column 21.

Therefore,110two− 1two= 101two'

Let us check the accuracy of the answer by considering 110two + 111two.

2.5 Applications of binary numbers

The fundamental digits in the binary number system are 0 and 1. Many modern 
digital instruments are made based on this feature. When designing lighting system 
circuits, “current off” and “current on” conditions are represented by 0 and 1.

  is used to represent the current “on” condition and    

   to represent the

     is represented by 1001two. 
current “off” condition, then the combination 
The storing of data and computations done in computers and calculators are based 
on this concept. Any number system can be developed under the same principles 
used to develop the binary number system. Storing of data can be done using other 
number systems too.

Note: If a number system is developed using base four, only the fundamental digits 

0, 1, 2 and 3 are used.
For  example,  the  decimal  number  4  is  expressed  as  10four  in  this  number 
system.
In the base five number system, the fundamental digits are 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, 
and the decimal number 5 is expressed as 10five in this system.

Summary

Summary 

²   In the binary number system, the fundamental digits are 0 and 1.

Fractions

By studying this lesson, you will be able to;
• simplify expressions of fractions which contain “of”,
• simplify expressions of fractions which contain brackets,
• identify the BODMAS method and solve problems involving fractions. 

Fractions 

Let us recall the facts that were learnt about fractions in previous grades. The circle 
shown below is divided into five equal parts of which three are shaded. 

The shaded region can be expressed as    3
5
this in terms of the area of the circle too. That is, the shaded area is   3
5
of the whole figure. If the total area of the circle is taken as 1 unit, then the shaded 
area is   3
5

  of the whole region. We can express 
 of the area 

 units.

When an object is divided into equal portions, one portion or several portions can 
be  expressed  as  a  fraction. A  portion  of  a  collection  can  also  be  expressed  as  a 
fraction.
For example, if we consider a team consisting of three boys and two girls, then the 
boys in the team can be considered as   3
 of the team. Here, if the whole team is 
5
considered as a unit, then the boys in the team can be expressed as   3
5

.

Let us now recall the facts that have been learnt previously about mixed numbers 
and improper fractions. 
Two identical circles are given below. One is shaded completely and three parts of 
the other (which is divided into equal parts) are shaded. 

If a circle is considered as one unit, the shaded fraction is 1 +  3

We can obtain a fraction equivalent to a given fraction by multiplying or dividing 
both the denominator and the numerator by the same number (which is not zero).

The addition and subtraction of fractions can be performed easily if the denominators 
of the fractions are equal.

If the denominators of the fractions are unequal, then we convert the fractions into 
equivalent fractions with equal denominators.

•  When  multiplying  two  fractions,  the  numerator  of  the  product  is  obtained  by 
multiplying the numerators of the two fractions and the denominator is obtained 
by multiplying the denominators of the two fractions.

3.1 Simplifying expressions of fractions containing “of” 

We know that 1
2

  of 100 rupees is 50 rupees.

We also know that this is one half of 100 rupees and that its value can be obtained 
by dividing 100 by 2.

 (multiplying by the reciprocal).

This can be written as 100 ÷ 2.
That is,  100 × 1
2
  of 100  = 100 × 1
2
 of 100 can be written as  1
2

Accordingly, 1

According to the above facts, 1

Let us similarly determine how much 1

This  amount  can  be  considered  as  one  part  from  5  equal  parts  into  which  20 

  of 20 kilogrammes is. 

kilogrammes is divided.

We can write this as 20 ÷ 5.
That is, 20 × 1
5

  (multiplying by the reciprocal).

1

  =   × 20  
5

20 × 1

According to the above facts, 1
5

 = 4'

 of 20 can be written as 1
5

 × 20.

It can be seen from the above instances that we can replace the term “of” by the 
operation “×”.

3.2 Simplifying expressions with brackets according to the
      BODMAS rule

A  numerical  expression  (or  algebraic  expression)  may  involve  several  of  the 
operations addition, subtraction, division, multiplication and raising to the power 
of. There should be agreement on the order in which these operations should be 
performed and a set of rules describing it. In previous grades we learnt these rules 
to some extent. In this section we will discuss the “BODMAS” rule that is used 
when simplifying fractions.

The acronym “BODMAS” stands for brackets, orders/of, division, multiplication, 
addition and subtraction. When simplify numerical expressions, priority is given 
according to the BODMAS order. However, some operations have the same priority. 
Multiplication and division have equal priority and so do addition and subtraction. 
Accordingly, expressions should be simplified as follows. 

1. First, simplify all expressions within brackets. 

35

                For free distribution.   
    
   
  
2. Then simplify powers and roots (expressions with indices) and the expressions 

with “of ” .

* Simplifying expressions with powers and roots is not included in the syllabus.

3. Next,  perform  divisions  and  multiplications.  These  have  equal  priority  and 
hence if both these operations are involved, priority is given from left to right.

4. Finally perform addition and subtraction. Since these too have equal priority, 

precedence is given from left to right, as in 3 above.

The BODMAS rule can be used to simplify expressions with fractions too. In some 
expressions of fractions the term “of” is used. 
For example,

5
12  of 

6
25

As learnt in the previous section, this means 

5
12 ×

is  needed  on  how  a  fairly  complex  expression  such  as                                               
 ×  1
 is to be simplified. Here, precedence is given to “of” over ÷  
2

Note:    Since “of” and “raising to the power of” have the same priority, the “O” 

in BODMAS is considered to stand for both “of” and “order”. However 

in this syllabus only  “of” is considered.

Now, let us consider how the BODMAS rule is used in simplifying the expression

There are disadvantages in using brackets too. When brackets are used, the expression 
will seem long and complex. Moreover, when simplifying an expression with the aid 
of a calculator, we have to insert brackets carefully because there is a greater chance 
of making an error. Therefore, it is important to decide on a convention to simplify 
expressions without using brackets. Such a convention is necessary especially when 
writing software for computers and calculators. However, a common convention 
accepted worldwide has not been agreed upon yet. There are several conventions 
which are accepted by different countries. Similarly, manufacturers of computers 
and calculators also have their own conventions.

Now  let  us  consider  some  examples  of  expressions  with  fractions  which  are 
simplified using the BODMAS convention.

Let us consider the expression 

8 − 3 × (4 + 1) + 12 ÷ 3 × 32  ÷ 4  as an example.

How  the  above  expression  is  simplified  using  the  BODMAS  rule  is  described 
below.

²  First the expression 4 +1 which is within brackets is simplified. This is equal 

to 5. Therefore we obtain

8 − 3 × 5 + 12 ÷ 3 × 32  ÷ 4

² Next the power 32 is simplified. This is equal to 9. Hence we obtain

8 − 3 × 5 + 12 ÷ 3 × 9  ÷ 4

²    Next  the  multiplications  and  divisions  are  performed  from  left  to  right. 
Therefore, 3 × 5 is simplified first. This is equal to 15. Therefore we obtain

8 − 15 + 12 ÷ 3 × 9  ÷ 4

² Next, 12 ÷ 3 is simplified. This is equal to 4. Hence we obtain

8 − 15 + 4 × 9  ÷ 4

² Next, 4 × 9  is simplified. This is equal to 36. Now the expression is 

  8 − 15 + 36 ÷ 4

39

                For free distribution. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
² Then  36 ÷ 4 is simplified. This is equal to 9. Therefore we obtain

8 − 15 + 9

² Now, since addition and subtraction have equal priority, simplification is done 

from left to right. Therefore we obtain 

− 7 + 9

²  Finally we get − 7 + 9 = 2 as the answer. According to the BODMAS order, 

8 − 3 × (4 + 1) + 12 ÷ 3 × 32 ÷ 4 = 2.

       Percentages

By studying this lesson you will be able to;

 ² calculate the profit earned or loss incurred through a sale,
 ² calculate the profit percentage or loss percentage,
 ² identify what commissions and discounts are,
 ² perform calculations in relation to commissions and discounts.

4.1 Profit and Loss

Most of the items that we use in our day to day lives are bought from supermarkets.
People who sell these items are known as sellers whereas people who buy them are 
known as customers.

The goods sold by sellers are either produced by them or are bought from someone 
else. In producing or buying goods, a cost is incurred. An item produced or purchased 
at a cost is generally sold at a price which is greater than the incurred cost. When 
selling goods at a price which is greater than the cost, it is said that the seller has 
earned a profit from the sale.

A seller will not always be able to sell his goods at a profit. For example, when 
goods are damaged or about to expire, they may have to be sold at a price which 
is less than the cost. In such a situation, it is said that the seller has incurred a loss.
When a seller sells an item at the price at which he bought it, he neither earns a 
profit nor incurs a loss. 

Accordingly, if
the selling price > the cost,
then a profit is earned, and

42

For free distribution 
 
 
 
             
profit = selling price – cost.

Similarly, if 
the cost > the selling price, then a loss is incurred and
loss = cost – selling price.

Example 1

A company which produces shoes incurs a cost of Rs 1000 in manufacturing a pair 
of shoes. The company sells each pair of shoes at Rs 2600. Find the profit earned 
by the company in selling one pair of shoes.

The manufacturing cost of a pair of shoes = Rs 1 000                  

Selling price = Rs 2 600

∴ Profit earned = Rs 2 600 –  1 000

= Rs  1 600

Example 2

A vendor buys a stock of fifty coconuts at the price of Rs 45 per coconut. If the 
vendor sells all the coconuts at the price of Rs 60 per fruit, calculate his profit.

Method I
The buying price of the stock of coconuts = Rs 45 × 50                                      

 =

 Rs  2 250

Income generated by selling the stock  = Rs 60 × 50
of coconuts 

= Rs 3 000

∴ The profit earned by selling the stock  = Rs 3 000 – 2 250

of coconuts  

       = Rs 750

Method II

The purchase price of a coconut  = Rs 45
The selling price of a coconut  = Rs 60
The profit earned by selling one coconut = Rs 60 – 45        

= Rs 15

The profit earned by selling the whole stock of coconuts = Rs 15 × 50

= Rs 750

Example 3

A  vendor  buys  a  stock  of  100  mangoes  at  the  price  of  Rs  20  each  and  decides 
to  sell  them  at  the  price  of  Rs  18  each  due  to  the  fruits  being  damaged  during 
transportation. Calculate the loss incurred by the vendor.

Method I

The purchase price of the stock of mangoes  = Rs  20 × 100            

= Rs 2 000                 

The amount made by selling the stock  = Rs 18 × 100
of mangoes 

= Rs 1 800

The loss incurred in selling the whole stock = Rs 2 000 – 1 800
of mangoes 

= Rs 200

Method II

The purchase price of a mango = Rs 20
The selling price of a mango = Rs 18

The loss incurred in selling a mango = Rs 20 – 18

= Rs 2

The loss incurred in selling the whole stock of mangoes = Rs 2 × 100

= Rs 200

Example 4

A vendor buys 60 kg of manioc from a farmer at the price of Rs 50 per kilogramme. 
He initially sells 20 kg at Rs 70 per kilogramme. Of the remaining manioc he sells 
15 kg at Rs 60 per kilogramme, 5 kg at Rs 50 per kilogramme and finally 10 kg at 
Rs 40 per kilogramme. The vendor discards the remaining 10 kg of manioc due to 
his inability to sell it. Determine whether the vendor earned a profit or incurred a 
loss from selling the manioc and calculate the profit earned or loss incurred by him.

The cost incurred in buying the manioc  =  Rs 50 × 60

=  Rs 3 000

The amount made by selling the first 20 kg of manioc  =  Rs 70 × 20

     =  Rs 1 400

For free distribution                       
                       
 
 
 
 
       
The amount made by selling the next 15 kg    =  Rs 60 × 15  
of manioc 
The amount made by selling 5 kg of manioc  =  Rs 50 × 5

      =  Rs 900

The amount made by selling 10 kg of manioc = Rs 40 × 10

      =  Rs 250

The amount made by selling the whole  
stock of manioc  

      =  Rs 400
      =  Rs 1400 + 900 + 250 + 400

      =  Rs 2 950

Since 3000 > 2950, a loss is incurred by the vendor. 

      The loss incurred by the vendor =  Rs 3000 − 2950

kilogramme.

 i.   Calculate the profit earned by the vendor on each day and determine on 

which day he earned a greater profit. 

 ii.  Calculate his total profit.

5.  The production cost of a cane chair is Rs 650. A manufacturer produces 20 
such chairs. He expects to earn a profit of Rs 7 000 by selling all the chairs. In 
order to do this, what should be the selling price of a chair?

6.   A vendor, who sells apples by the roadside after buying them from a wholesaler, 
buys 200 apples on a certain day at the price of Rs 25 per fruit. He expects to 
earn a profit of Rs 1000 by selling the whole stock of apples. In order to do 
this, determine the price at which he should sell a fruit.

7.  A vendor bought a stock of 50 kg of onions at the price of  Rs 60 per kilogramme 
and sold 30 kg of it at the price of Rs 80 per kilogramme. He had to sell the 
remaining stock of onions at a lesser price because they were close to getting 
spoilt. Due to this, the vendor neither made a profit nor incurred a loss from 
selling the whole stock of onions. Find the price at which the vendor sold each 
kilogramme of the remaining stock of onions.

4.2 Profit percentage/loss percentage

Ramesh and Suresh are two vendors. Ramesh owns a clothing store. He sells a pair 
of trousers which he bought for Rs 800, at the price of Rs 900. Suresh owns an 
electrical items store. He sells an electric kettle which he bought for Rs 2500, at the 
price of Rs 2600.

46

For free distribution 
 
 
  
The items sold by Ramesh and Suresh are not the same, and the buying prices and 
selling prices of the items are also different. However, the profit earned by them 
from selling the items is equal. 

The profit earned by Ramesh from selling a pair of trousers = Rs 900 – 800

= Rs 100

The profit earned by Suresh from selling an electric  kettle = Rs 2600 – 2500

= Rs 100

Can you identify which of these two sellers engaged in the more profitable sale if 
both had Rs 5000 each?

Even though the profit earned by Ramesh and Suresh is equal, it is clear that the 
amount of money each person spent in order to earn that profit is not equal. In order 
to find out which was the more profitable sale, the amount of money spent by each 
person has to be considered. The below given calculation is performed in order to 
determine this.

The profit earned by Ramesh after spending Rs 800 = Rs 100

The profit earned by Ramesh as a fraction of the amount he spent  =  

100
800

The profit earned by Suresh after spending Rs 2500 = Rs 100

 The profit earned by Suresh as a fraction of the amount he spent =  

100
2500

It  is  easy  to  compare  the  fractions 
100
2500 

fractions are equal. Since 

100
800

 > 

100
800

  and 

100
2500

since  the  numerators  of  both 

 Ramesh's transaction was more profitable.  

Even when the numerators are not equal, the more profitable business is determined 
using a similar method. Since the comparison of fractions when the denominators 
are  different  could  be  difficult,  these  fractions  are  most  often  converted  into 
percentages to facilitate comparison. Let us calculate these percentages as follows.

Since 12.5%  >  4%, it can be said that Ramesh’s transaction was more profitable. 

The meaning of the percentages calculated above can be described as follows.
100  × 100 is the profit Ramesh earns from spending Rs 100.

The  profit  earned/loss  incurred  by  a  vendor  when  the  buying  price/production 
cost of the item is Rs 100, is known as the profit/loss percentage. Therefore, by 
representing  the  profit/loss  as  a  fraction  of  the  buying  price/production  cost  and 
multiplying that fraction by 100%, the profit/ loss percentage can be calculated. 

Profit percentage =

Example 1

A vendor buys exercise books at Rs 25 each, and sells them at Rs 30 each. Calculate 
the profit percentage earned by the vendor from selling one exercise book.

Profit = Rs 30 – 25
= Rs 5

Profit percentage =   25
= 20%

× 100%

Example 2

A vendor buys a pair of trousers for Rs 500. Due to a damage, he sells it for Rs 450. 
Determine the loss percentage.

Loss  = Rs 500 – 450
= Rs 50

50
Loss percentage = 500
= 10%

 × 100%

Example 3

A carpenter incurs a cost of Rs 4000 in making a table which he sells at Rs 5600. A 
blacksmith  incurs  a  cost  of  Rs  250  in  making  a  knife  which  he  sells  at  Rs  360. 
Determine who has engaged in the more profitable sale. 

The profit earned by the carpenter as a percentage 
of the cost incurred 

=

If  a  vendor  buys  an  almirah  for  Rs  30  000  and  earns  a  profit 
percentage of 15% (of the purchase price) by selling it, calculate 
the selling price of the almirah.

Method I
Here, what is meant by a profit percentage of 15% is that, if Rs 100 is invested, 
then a profit of Rs 15 is earned. In other words, if Rs 100 is invested, then the item 
is sold at the price of Rs 115. 

Therefore, the selling price of the item when Rs 30 000 is  

invested 

Method II
As in method I above, 
since the profit is Rs 15 when Rs 100 is invested,

 115
=  100

  ×  30 000

= Rs 34 500

the profit earned when Rs 30 000 is invested  = 

  × 30 000 

 15
100
 Rs 4 500

Therefore, the selling price of the item = cost + profit 

 30 000 + 4 500

=  Rs 34 500

Example 5

A vendor buys a pair of shoes for Rs 1500 and sells it at a loss of 2%. What is the 
selling price of the pair of shoes?                                              

Method I
Since the pair of shoes is sold at a loss of 2%,                           

the selling price if the item is worth Rs 100 = Rs 98
 98
100

∴ The selling price of the item worth Rs 1 500 = Rs 

 × 1 500

= Rs 1 470

Method II

2
The loss incurred = Rs 1 500 × 100

= Rs 30

∴ The selling price = Rs 1 500 – 30

= Rs 1 470

Example 6

If  a  vendor  earns  a  profit  of  10%  by  selling  a  television  set  at  the  price  of                                     
Rs 22 000, find the price at which the vendor bought the set. 

Method I
In order to earn a profit of 10% when the purchase price of the item is Rs 100, the 
item should be sold for Rs 110.
Therefore, the purchase price of an item sold for Rs 110 at a profit = Rs 100
of 10% 

∴ The purchase price of an item sold for Rs  22 000 at a  = Rs 
    profit of 10%  

100
110

 × 22 000

= Rs 20 000

Method II
If the purchase price of the item is Rs x, then                          

10
the profit earned = Rs x ×  100

x

The selling price of the item = Rs x +

If the purchase price is Rs x,

the selling price = Rs x  ×

∴ x  × 

110

x = 20 000

Therefore, the purchase price of the set is Rs 20 000.

Example 7

A vendor had to sell a sports item for Rs 6 800 due to a manufacturing defect, which 
caused him a loss of 15%. Find the purchase price of the item.
Method I
The selling price of an item which is bought at Rs 100 and sold at a loss of 15%, is 
Rs 85. 
 ∴The purchase price of an item sold at Rs 85 at a loss of 15% = Rs 100
100
85

Hence, the purchase price of an item sold at Rs 6 800 at a = Rs 
loss of 15%

 × 6 800

 =

 Rs 8 000

Method II
If the purchase price of the item is Rs x,
 15
the loss incurred  = Rs x × 100

∴ The selling price of the item 

 3x
= Rs 20

 3x
Then, x −  20
20x −3x

x = 6 800 ×

x = 8 000

20

∴The purchase price of the item is Rs 8000.

4.3  Discounts and Commissions

Discounts

A discount of 20% is given on 
every book

The  price  at  which  an  item  is  expected  to  be  sold  is  called  the  marked  price. 
According to the Consumer Affairs Authority Act, the price of an item that is for 
sale needs to be marked on the item.

A  notice  displayed  in  a  bookshop  is  given  in  the  picture  shown  above.  What  is 
mentioned in the notice is that a discount of 20% is given when a book is bought. 
This means that, when the book is purchased, 20% will be reduced from the price 
mentioned on the book. The amount that is reduced is called a “discount”. Most 
often, a discount is indicated as a percentage of the marked price. 

Since  customers  usually  tend  to  buy  goods  from  shops  which  offer  discounts, 
there is an increase in sales in these shops. Due to this, the profits of the shop also 
increase. Discounts result in direct benefits for customers while the shop owners 
too gain long term benefits.

Example 1

Kaveesha buys books which are worth Rs 1500 from a bookshop which offers a 
discount of 20%. Calculate the discount that Kaveesha receives.

 20
Discount = Rs 1 500 × 100
= Rs 300

Example 2

The production cost of a mobile phone is Rs 9000. The price of the phone has been 
marked keeping a profit of Rs 3000. If the phone is sold at a discount of 10% on the 
marked price, find the selling price.

Method I
The marked price = Rs 9000 + 3000

= Rs 12 000

 10
Discount  = Rs 12 000 × 100
= Rs 1 200

∴ Selling price = Rs 12 000 – 1 200

= Rs 10 800

Method II
Since an item of marked price Rs 100 is sold for Rs 90 when the discount is 10%,
the selling price of an item of marked price Rs 100, sold at a  = Rs 90
discount of 10%  

 90
∴ The selling price of an item of marked price Rs 12 000,  = Rs 100
     sold at a discount of 10% 

× 12 000

= Rs 10 800

Note:      In  the  above  example,  two  methods  of  solving  the  problem  have  been 
given. Since the second method presented is shorter than the first, it is 
important to practice this method.

Commissions

A notice issued by a company which facilitates the sale of properties, vehicles and 
houses  is  shown  in  the  above  picture. While  such  companies  find  customers  for 
these kinds of sales, once the deal is over, a certain percentage of the value of the 
transaction is charged by the company. Such companies are known as brokerages. 
The amount that is charged by such companies for facilitating the sale is known as 
the commission. This is usually a percentage of the value of the transaction.

Example 5

What is the commission charged by a company for facilitating the sale of a motorcar 
worth Rs 3 000 000, if a commission of 5% is charged?

The commission charged = Rs 3 000 000 × 

 =  Rs 150 000

5.1 Substitution

In grade 8, you learnt to find the value of an algebraic expression by substituting 
integers for the unknown terms. Let us now find out how to obtain the value of an 
algebraic expression by substituting directed numbers. 

♦  20 adults and 16 children went on a trip. Each adult was given x amount of bread 

and each child was given y amount of bread for breakfast. 

Let us write the total amount of bread that was distributed as an algebraic expression.

Amount of bread given to the 20 adults = 20x
Amount of bread given to the 16 children = 16y
Total amount of bread that was distributed = 20x + 16y 

Let us find out the total amount of bread that was distributed, if an adult was given 
half a loaf of bread and a child was given a quarter loaf of bread.

.  To  find  out  the  total  amount  of  bread  that  was 

  should  be  substituted  in  the  expression

5.2 The product of two binomial expressions

Let us first recall what is meant by algebraic symbols, algebraic terms, algebraic 
expressions and binomial expressions. The letters x, y, z, a, b, c, …are considered 
as algebraic symbols. 

Algebraic symbols such as x, y and z are also considered as algebraic terms.

When an algebraic symbol is multiplied or divided by a number, as for example, 2x, 

5y, –2a and  

x , it too is considered as an algebraic term.
3

Similarly, when an algebraic symbol is multiplied or divided by another algebraic 
b  , it is also called an algebraic term. The 
symbol, as for example,  xy, ay and 
z
products and quotients of algebraic symbols and numbers such as 2xy, –3zab and 
2  xy are also called algebraic terms. 
5

63

For free distribution 
 
 
 
 
Algebraic terms can also be considered as algebraic expressions (expressions with 

one term).

A  sum  or  a  difference  of  algebraic  terms  is  called  an  algebraic  expression.  For 
example,  x  +  y,  2a  +  xyz,  4xy2  –  yz  and  –  2x  +  3xy  are  algebraic  expressions. 
Similarly, when a number is added to or subtracted from an algebraic term, it is 
also called an algebraic expression. For example, 4 + x and 1– 3ab are algebraic 
expressions. 

All the algebraic expressions we have considered thus far have consisted of two 
terms. A “binomial algebraic expression” (or simply a “binomial expression) is an 
expression which is a sum or difference of two terms. 

However, there can be any number of terms in an algebraic expression.               
3 + ax – 2xyz + xy is an algebraic expression with four terms. It has three algebraic 
terms and a number (constant term). 

In this lesson we will be studying binomial expressions. Now let us consider the 
product of two binomial expressions.

Let us take the length of a side of the square shaped flower bed shown in the figure 
below as x units. If a larger rectangular flower bed is made by increasing the length 
of one side by 3 units and the length of the adjacent side by 2 units, let us consider 
how an algebraic expression can be constructed in terms of x, for the area of the 
larger flower bed.

x

x × x = x2

x

2

x × x = x2

x × 3 = 3x

x × 2 = 2x

3 × 2 = 6

The length of the larger flower bed  = x + 3 units
The breadth of the larger flower bed  = x + 2 units

According to the figure, 
the area of the larger flower bed = length × breadth= (x + 3) (x + 2) square 
                          units 

(1)  

64

For free distribution 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Observe that (x + 3) (x + 2) is a product of two binomial expressions.

The area of the larger flower bed can also be found by using a different method, 
that is, by adding the areas of the four smaller sections of which it is composed. The 
four sections are, the initial square shaped section and the three smaller rectangular 
sections in the figure. 

Accordingly,
the area of the larger flower bed = the sum of the areas of the four smaller sections

= x2 + 2x + 3x + 6  square units
= x2 + 5x + 6 square units 

(2) 

Irrespective of the method used to find the area, the expressions obtained for the area 
should be equal to each other.  Therefore, from (1) and (2) the following equality 
is established.

 (x + 3) (x + 2) = x2 + 5x + 6 

Let us now consider how this equality can be obtained without the aid of a figure.

Let us multiply the terms within the second pair of brackets by the two terms within 
the first pair of brackets.

                      (x + 3) (x + 2)  =  (x + 3) (x + 2)

= x (x + 2) + 3 (x + 2)
= x2 + 2x + 3x + 6
= x2 + 5x  + 6
Accordingly, the product of two binomial expressions can be obtained in the above 
manner without the aid of a figure.

Let us consider another activity similar to the one above.

Factors of Algebraic 
Expressions

By studying this lesson, you will be able to;
•  factorize algebraic expressions with four terms when the factors are binomial 

expressions,

•  factorize trinomial quadratic expressions of the form x2 + bx + c,
•  factorize algebraic expressions written as a difference of two squares.

Factors of algebraic expressions

The meanings of many algebraic terms were explained in the previous lesson. In 
this lesson we will consider what is meant by the factors of an algebraic expression 
(or an algebraic term).

Consider the term 2xy. It is formed by the product of 2, x and y. Therefore, 2, x and 
y are all factors of 2xy.

2x + 2y is a binomial expression. It is the sum of two algebraic terms. 2 and x are 
factors of 2x. Similarly, 2 and y are factors of 2y. Accordingly, 2 is a factor of both 
the terms 2x and 2y. You have learnt in grade 8 that the above binomial expression 
can be written as 2 (x + y) by factoring out the common factor 2. Hence;

2x + 2y = 2 (x + y)

What is important here is that the algebraic expression 2x + 2y, which is the sum 
of 2x and 2y, is expressed as a product of 2 and x + y. We say that 2 and x + y are 
factors of 2x + 2y. That is, the algebraic expression 2x + 2y can be expressed as a 
product of its factors 2 and x + y.

One factor of the above algebraic expression 2x + 2y is the number 2 and another 
factor is the algebraic expression x + y. However, an algebraic expression could 
also  be  expressed  as  a  product  of  algebraic  terms  or  algebraic  expressions.  For 
example, since the expression xy + 5xz can be written as x(y + 5z), x and y + 5z are 
factors of it.

69

For free distribution 
 
 
 
 
According to the facts learnt in lesson 5, when the algebraic expression x(y + 5z)
which is a product is expanded, we obtain the algebraic expression xy + 5xz, which 
is a sum of algebraic terms. In this lesson we will study the inverse of the process 
that was learnt in lesson 5. That is, we will learn how to write a given algebraic 
expression as a product of factors.

Observe how each algebraic expression given below has been written as a product 
of factors as learnt in grade 8. 

 ² 3x + 12 = 3 (x + 4)
 ² 6a + 12b –18 = 6 (a + 2b – 3)
 ² – 2x – 6y = –2 (x + 3y) 
 ² 3x – 6xy = 3x (1 – 2y)

In the second example above, the common factor of the terms of the expression                      
6a  +12b  −18  is  6.  Observe  that  this  is  the  highest  common  factor  of  6,  12  and 
18. When  a  number  is  a  common  factor,  we  should  always  consider  the  highest 
common factor. Furthermore, when factorizing algebraic expressions, the numbers 
need not be factorized further. For example, 6x + 6y is written as 6(x + y) and not 
as 2 × 3 (x + y).

Do the following review exercise to establish these facts further.

The length of the large rectangle = a + b
The breadth of the large rectangle = x + y
Hence, the area of the large rectangle = (a + b) ( x + y)

Now, since the total area of the 4 small rectangles = the area of the large rectangle,             
ax + ay + bx + by = (a + b)  (x + y).

We can verify the total above equality by expanding the product (a + b)(x + y) by 
using the method learnt in the previous lesson.

Let us expand it as follows.

(a + b)(x + y) = a (x + y) + b (x + y)

= ax + ay + bx + by 

The validity of the equality is verified.

In  this  lesson  we  expect  to  learn  how  to  write  an  expression  of  the  form                                      
ax + bx + ay +by as a product of two factors as (a + b) (x + y). First, we need to 
observe that the four terms ax, ay, bx and by have no common factors. Therefore, the 
factoring out of a common factor cannot be done directly. However, if we consider 
the four terms pairwise, the expression can be factored as follows.

71

For free distribution 
     ax + bx + ay  + by = (ax + bx) + (ay  + by)   

= x (a + b) + y (a + b) 

The final expression is the sum of the two expressions x(a + b) and y(a + b).
Now  observe  that  the  two  expressions  x  (a  +  b)  and  y  (a  +  b)  have  a  common 
factor (a + b). Therefore, by factoring out this expression, we can rewrite the given 
expression as a product of two factors as (a + b) (x + y). 

ax + bx + ay  + by = x (a + b) + y (a + b)

=  (a + b) (x + y)

Example 1

Factorize 3x + 6y + kx + 2ky.

3x + 6y + kx + 2ky = 3 (x + 2y) + k (x + 2y)    

= (x + 2y) (3 + k)

Example 2

Factorize a2 – 3a + ab – 3b. 

    a2 – 3a + ab – 3b = a (a – 3) + b (a – 3)    

= (a – 3) (a + b)

Example 3

Factorize x2  + xy – x – y. 

x2  + xy – x – y = x2  + xy – 1 (x + y)

= x (x + y) – 1 (x + y)
= (x + y) (x – 1)

6.2 Factors of trinomial quadratic expressions of the form of                      

x2 + bx + c

Recall how we obtained the product of the two algebraic expressions (x + 3) and 
(x + 4).

(x + 3) (x + 4) = x (x + 4) + 3 (x + 4)

= x2 + 4x + 3x + 12

= x2 + 7x + 12

Since  we  have  obtained  x2  +  7x  +  12  as  the  product  of  (x  +  3)  and  (x  +  4),  the 
expressions (x + 3) and (x + 4) are factors of x2 + 7x + 12. Expressions of the form 
x2 + 7x + 12 consisting of three terms of which one is a quadratic term are called 
trinomial quadratic expressions.  

Note:
The trinomial quadratic expressions we consider here can in general be written 
in  the  form  x2  +  bx  +  c.  Here  b  and  c  are  numerical  values.  For  example,                                          
x2 +  7x  +  12  is  the  trinomial  quadratic  expression  that  is  obtained  when  b  =  7 
and    c = 12. In general, bx is called the middle term and c is called the constant 
term. The expression x2 + 7x + 12 can be written as a product of two factors as 
(x + 3)(x + 4). However, there are some trinomial quadratic expressions which 
cannot be written as a product of two such factors, as for example, the expression                             
x2 + 3x + 4. 

Here,  we  only  consider  how  to  find  the  factors  of  those  trinomial  quadratic 
expressions that can be written as a product of two factors.

To  find  out  how  to  write  a  trinomial  quadratic  expression  as  a  product  of  two 
binomial terms, let us analyze the steps we carried out in obtaining the product of 
two binomial expressions, in the opposite direction. 

• In the trinomial quadratic expression x2 + 7x + 12, the middle term 7x has been 

written as a sum of two terms as 3x + 4x.

  There  are  many  ways  of  writing  7x  as  a  sum  of  two  terms.  For  example,                                 
7x = 5x + 2x and 7x = 8x + (−x ). The importance of 3x and 4x can be explained 
as follows. 

• The product of 3x and 4x =  3x × 4x = 12x2.

•  Moreover,  the  product  of  the  first  and  last  terms  of  the  trinomial  quadratic 

expression x2 + 7x + 12 is also x2× 12 = 12x2.

73

For free distribution 
 
The  observations  from  the  above  analysis  can  be  used  to  factorize  trinomial 
quadratic expressions. The middle term should be written as a sum of two terms. 
Their  product  should  be  equal  to  the  product  of  the  first  and  last  terms  of  the 
expression to be factorized. 

Let us factorize x2 + 6x + 8. The middle term is 6x. It should be written as a sum of 
two terms, and their product should be equal to x2 × 8 = 8x2.

Based on the above facts, we have to find a pair of linear terms of which the product 
is 8x2 and the sum is 6x. The table below shows the possible ways of writing 8x2 as 
a product of two linear terms.

Pair of linear terms
x, 8x
2x, 4x

Product
x × 8x = 8x2 
2x × 4x = 8x2

Sum 
x + 8x = 9x
2x + 4x = 6x

According to the table, it is clear that the middle term 6x is obtained from 2x + 4x. 
Let us factorize the expression x2 + 6x + 8.

x2 + 6x + 8 = x2 + 2x + 4x + 8

= x (x + 2) + 4 (x + 2)
=  (x + 2) (x + 4)

∴ x + 2 and x + 4 are factors of x2+ 6x + 8.

Instead of writing the middle term as 2x + 4x, let us write it as 4x + 2x and factorize 
to see whether we obtain different factors.

x2 + 6x + 8 = x2 + 4x + 2x + 8

= x (x + 4) + 2 (x + 4)
=  (x + 4) (x + 2)

The same pair of factors are obtained. Therefore, we see that the order in which the 
selected pair is written does not affect the final answer. 

Example 1

Factorize x2 + 5x + 6.
In this expression, 
the product of the first and last terms = x2 × 6 =  6x2   
The middle term = 5x

74

For free distributionWe can factorize this expression as below, because 2x + 3x = 5x and (2x) (3x) = 6x2 
x2 + 5x + 6 = x2 + 2x + 3x + 6

= x (x + 2) + 3 (x + 2)
=  (x + 2) (x + 3)

Example 2

Factorize x2 – 8x + 12.
The product of the first and last terms of the expression is x2 × 12 = 12x2  and the 
middle term is  (– 8x). Here we have a negative term. The table given below shows 
the various ways in which two terms in x can be selected such that their product is 
12x2.

    x,   12x
  2x,   6x
  3x,   4x
 −2x,  −6x
 −3x, −4x
−x,   −12x

According  to  the  table,  if  we  write  –  8x  =  (−2x)  +  (−6x),  then  we  obtain                         
(−2x)(−6x) = 12x2.  

Hence,  x2 – 8x + 12 = x2 – 2x – 6x + 12

= x (x – 2) – 6 (x – 2)
=  (x – 2) (x – 6)

Example 3

Factorize y2 + 2y – 15.

The product of the first and last terms of the expression = y2 × – 15  = – 15y2 
The middle term = 2y  
By writing –15y2 = (5y) (−3y), the middle term is obtained as (5y) + (−3y) = 2y 

Therefore,

    y2 + 2y – 15 = y2 – 3y + 5y – 15

= y (y – 3) + 5 (y – 3)
=  (y – 3) (y + 5)

Factorize a2 – a – 20.
The product of the first and last terms of the expression is = a2 × (– 20) = – 20a2 and 
the middle term is (– a).

Since –20a2 = (–5a) (4a) and (–5a) + (4a)  = −a, the expression can be factored as 
follows.
a2 – a – 20 = a2 + 4a – 5a – 20

= a (a + 4) – 5 (a + 4)
=  (a + 4) (a – 5)

Note:
When  factorizing  trinomial  quadratic  expressions,  writing  the  middle  term  as 
a sum of two suitable terms is an important step. Although a specific method 
has  been  given  above  to  find  the  two  terms,  an  easier  method  is  to  write  the 
middle  term  as  a  sum  of  two  terms  and  check  whether  their  product  is  equal 
to the product of the first and last terms of the given expression. This skill can 
be mastered with practice. However, once the two terms have been written, we 
have to be careful when simplifying the expression. In example 4 above, when 
the common factor −5 is factored out from the expression −5a −20, we obtain 
−5(a + 4) This is often mistakenly written as  −5(a − 4). 

6.3 Factors of an expression written as a difference of two 
      squares

Consider the product of the two binomial expressions (x – y)  and (x + y). 
(x – y) (x + y) = x (x + y) – y (x + y)

= x2 + xy – xy – y2
= x2  – y2 

76

For free distribution 
 
 
Accordingly, (x + y) (x – y) is equal to the expression x2 – y2. The expression x2 – y2 
is said to be a difference of two squares. 

The fact that (x + y) (x – y) = x2 – y2 means that x + y and x – y are factors of x2 – y2 .

Let us see whether we can find the factors of x2 – y2  by considering it as a quadratic 
expression in x. We can rewrite it as a trinomial quadratic expression in x by writing 
the middle term as 0. We then obtain the expression x2 + 0 – y2. Now consider its 
factorization. 

The product of the first and last terms of the expression is = x2 × (– y2) = – x2 y2 and 
the middle term is 0.
Now,

–x2 y2 = (– x y) × (x y) and  – x y + xy = 0

Therefore, x2 + 0 – y2 = x2 – xy  + xy – y2 

= x  (x – y) + y (x – y) 
= (x – y) (x + y)

Again we obtain x2 – y2 = (x – y) (x + y).

Now  let  us  consider  how  to  find  the  factors  of  the  difference  of  two  squares  by 
considering areas.

Consider a square of side length a units.

The area of the remaining portion according to figure II  is  (a – b) (a + b).
Accordingly, a2 – b2 = (a – b) (a + b).

Now let us consider some examples of the factorization of expressions which are 
the difference of two squares.

x2 – 25 = x2 – 52

4a2 – 49 = 22a2 – 72

Example 5

Factorize 2x2  – 72' 
2x2 – 72 = 2 (x2 – 36)

Axioms

By studying this lesson, you will be able to;
² identify five fundamental axioms of mathematics,
²  develop  geometrical  relationships  and  solve  problems  involving  calculations           

using the five fundamental axioms.

Axioms 

Statements which are considered to be self-evident and are accepted without proof 
are  called  axioms.  In  mathematics,  axioms  are  used  to  explain  facts  logically, 
develop relationships and reach conclusions. 

Euclid, who is considered to be  the father of geometry lived in Greece around 300 
B.C. He introduced certain axioms related to mathematics in his book “Elements”. 
Some of them are unique to geometry. Others are common axioms which can be 
used in other areas including algebra. 

We consider five common axioms in this lesson. They can be summarized as given 
below. 

1.   Quantities which are equal to the same quantity, are equal.
2.    Quantities which are obtained by adding equal quantities to equal quantities, 

 are equal.

3.   Quantities which are obtained by subtracting equal quantities from equal 

 quantities, are equal.

4.  Products which are equal quantities multiplied by equal quantities, are equal.
5.   Quotients which are equal quantities divided by nonzero equal quantities, 

are equal.

By  “quantities”  we  usually  mean  lengths,  areas,  volumes,  masses,  speeds, 
magnitudes of angles, etc. 

These five axioms are very important because we can derive many results related to 
algebra and geometry by using them. Let us study these axioms in detail.

Axiom 1

We can write this axiom briefly as given below. 

If b = a and c = a, then b = c.

According to this axiom,

‘If Hasith’s age is the same as Kasun’s and Harsha’s age is also the same as Kasun’s, 
then Hasith’s age is the same as Harsha’s.’

How Axiom 1 is used to obtain geometrical results is seen in the simple example 
given below.

In the quadrilateral ABCD shown below BC = AB and CD = AB .

B

C

A

D

According to the above axiom, 
BC = CD.

Example 1

In the triangle ABC, AB = AC and AB = BC  If AC = 5 cm then determine the perimeter 
of the triangle ABC.

A

B

C

Since AC = 5 cm and AC = AB, according to Axiom 1, AB = 5 cm.
Since AB = 5 cm and AB = BC, according to Axiom 1, BC = 5 cm. 
The perimeter of the triangle ABC = AC + BC + AB 

   = 5 cm + 5 cm + 5 cm 
   = 15 cm

Quantities which are obtained by adding equal quantities to equal quantities, 
are equal.

If x = y and p = q, then x + p = y + q.

According to this axiom,

“If  the  cost  incurred  in  purchasing  vegetables  is  equal  to  the  cost  incurred  in                       
purchasing  milk  and  the  cost  incurred  in  purchasing  fruits  is  equal  to  the  cost 
incurred in purchasing eggs, then the cost incurred in purchasing vegetables and 
fruits is equal to the cost incurred in purchasing milk and eggs.”

axiom.

located  on  the  straight  line  XY,  such  that  XA  =  AB  =  BC  =  CD  =  DY. 
The  points  K,  L,  M  and  N  are  located  on  the  straight  line  PQ,  such  that

Let us show that XY = PQ.

Since XA =  AB = BC = CD = DY, it is clear that 5 XA = XY.
Similarly, since PK = KL = LM = MN = NQ, we obtain that 5 PK = PQ.
Since XA = PK, by applying Axiom 4 we obtain 5 XA = 5 PK.
...  XY = PQ.         

Although it is important to understand how results are derived by using axioms, in 
practice, when deriving geometrical results, the relevant axioms are not mentioned. 
This is because, as implied by the word “axiom”, the validity of the derivation is 
obvious. 

Now, let us consider how this axiom is applied in algebra. 

If x = 5 and y = 2x, let us find the value of y.
Since x = 5, applying the above axiom and multiplying both sides by 2 we obtain 
2x = 2 × 5.
But 2 × 5 = 10. 
Hence by Axiom 1 we obtain

y = 10.

Example 1  
The points X and Y are located on the side AB of the triangle ABC such that AX = XY = YB. 
The points P and Q are located on the side AC such that AP = PQ = QC. If AX = AP, find 
the relationship between AB and AC.

Further applications of the axioms

Example 1  

Solve the equation given below using the axioms.
2x + 5 = 13

Here,  solving  the  equation  means  finding  the  value  of  x.  Since  the  quantity                             
2x + 5 is equal to the quantity 13, according to Axiom 3, the quantities obtained by 
subtracting 5 from these two quantities are also equal. 
∴ 2x + 5 − 5 = 13 − 5.
Simplifying this we obtain,
2x = 8.
Since the quantity 2x is equal to the quantity 8, the quantities that are obtained by 
dividing these two quantities by 2 are also equal. Therefore, 2x
2

8

 =

When we simplify this we obtain x = 4. That is, the solution of the equation is 4.

Theorem:
The sum of the adjacent angles formed by a straight line meeting

The values of these angles in degrees have been denoted by a, b, c and d. In a situation 
such as this too, we say that the angles are on the straight line AB. Furthermore, 
since AOB

a + b + c + d = 180.
It is also clear that this relationship holds true for any number of angles on a straight 
line. Therefore,

“The sum of the magnitudes of the angles on a straight line is 180°.”

Therefore AOD

>

>

 and  BOC

 are also a pair of vertically opposite angles. 

Accordingly, it is clear that two pairs of vertically opposite angles are formed by the 
intersection of two straight lines. 
Let us now consider a theorem related to vertically opposite angles. 

Theorem:
The vertically opposite angles formed by the intersection of two straight lines 
are equal. 

By considering the figure, it can clearly be seen that ‘vertically opposite angles are 
equal’. However, by using the fact we learnt earlier, that ‘the sum of the angles on a 
straight line is 180’, and also the axioms learnt in the previous lesson, this theorem 
can be proved as follows.

Proof:
Since AB is a straight line,

AOC

 + BOC

 = 180o (angles on the straight line AB)

Similarly, since CD is a straight line,

 = 180o (angles on the straight line CD)

(iii) c1 and c2 

(iv) d1 and d2

Each of these pairs of angles is a pair of corresponding angles. 

To be a pair of corresponding angles, the following characteristics should be there 
in the two angles. 

  1.  Both angles should lie on the same side of the transversal.

According  to  the  above  figure,  both  the  angles  a1  and  a2  are  on  the  left  side  of 
the  transversal.  Similarly,  both  the  angles  b1  and  b2  are  on  the  right  side  of  the 
transversal. Also, the two angles c1 and c2 are on the left side of the transversal and 
the two angles d1 and d2 are on the right side of the transversal.

2. Both  angles  should  be  in  the  same  direction  with  respect  to  the  two 

straight lines. 

According to the given figure, the angles a1 and a2 lie above the lines AB and CD 
respectively. The angles b1 and b2 also lie above the lines AB and CD respectively. 
Similarly, the angles c1 and c2 lie below the lines AB and CD respectively, and the 
angles d1 and d2 also lie below the lines AB and CD respectively.

The characteristics common to these pairs of angles that can be used to identify 
pairs of alternate angles are the following. 

1. The two angles should be on opposite sides of the transversal.

According  to  the  above  figure,  the  angles  a2  and  d1  lie  on  opposite  sides  of  the 
transversal. Similarly, c1 and b2 also lie on opposite sides of the transversal.

2. The line segment of the transversal, which lies between the two straight 

lines, should be a common arm of the two angles.

(i) a pair of corresponding angles are equal or
(ii)  a pair of alternate angles are equal or
(iii) the sum of a pair of allied angles is equal to 180o,

then the straight lines AB and RC are parallel. 

This result which is true in general, can be expressed as a theorem as follows.

Theorem : When two straight lines are intersected by a transversal, if

(i)  a pair of corresponding angles are equal or
(ii)   a pair of alternate angles are equal or
(iii)  the sum of a pair of allied angles is 180o, then the two  

straight lines are parallel to each other.

Activity 2

Step  1:  On  a  sheet  of A4  paper,  draw  two  straight 
lines  AB  and  CD  parallel  to  each  other  (the 
parallel lines can be drawn using a set square 
and  a  straight  edge),  and  a  transversal  PQ 
such that it intersects the lines AB and CD at R 
and S respectively, as shown in the figure.

(i) Measure the magnitudes of the pair of corresponding angles SRB

and PSD

and check whether they are equal. Similarly, measure the magnitudes of the 
other pairs of corresponding angles and check whether they too are equal.

>

(ii) Measure the magnitudes of the pair of alternate angles CSR

and 
check whether they are equal. Similarly, measure the magnitudes of the 
other pair of alternate angles and check whether they too are equal. 

and SRB

(iii)  Measure  the  magnitudes  of  the  pair  of  allied  angles  DSR

>

>

and  SRB

and  check  whether  they  are  supplementary.  Similarly,  measure  the 
magnitudes of the other pair of allied angles and check whether they too 
are supplementary.

Step  3:  Change  the  inclination  of  the  transversal  PQ  and  repeat  the  above  two 

steps.

You  would  have  observed  in  the  above  activity  that  when  two  parallel  lines  are 
intersected by a transversal,

(i) each pair of corresponding angles is equal, 
(ii) each pair of alternate angles is equal, 
(iii) each pair of allied angles is supplementary.

This result is true in general and can be expressed as a theorem as follows.

 i. the corresponding angles formed are equal,
ii. the alternate angles formed are equal,

           iii. the sum of each pair of allied angles formed equals two right 

    angles.

Observe that the above theorem is the converse of the theorem learnt earlier.

i.  a pair of corresponding angles are equal or
ii.   a pair of alternate angles are equal or
iii.  the sum of a pair of allied angles is 180o, then the two    

straight lines are parallel to each other.

² When a transversal intersects a pair of parallel lines,

  Liquid Measurements

 By studying this lesson, you will be able to;
²  determine the relationship between 
  milllilitres (ml) and cubic centimetres (cm3),

litres (l) and cubic centimetres (cm3),
litres(l) and cubic metres (m3), as units which are used to measure liquid  

volumes, and

² 

solve problems involving units which are used to measure liquid volumes.

Volume and capacity

We know that the amount of space occupied by a solid or a liquid is known as its 
volume. 
A solid has a definite shape and a definite volume. Although a liquid has a definite 
volume, it does not have a definite shape. A liquid always takes the shape of its 
container.
The below given pictures show 200 ml of drink in different shaped containers

200 ml

200 ml

200 ml

200 ml

When  that  quantity  of  drink  is  poured  into  the  different  shaped  containers,  even 
though the liquid takes the shape of the container, its volume of 200 ml remains 
unchanged. In the first picture, the container is completely filled with the 200 ml 
of  drink.  Therefore,  the  capacity  of  that  container  is  200  ml.  The  capacity  of  a 
container is the maximum volume that it can hold.

Do the following review exercise to recall the facts that you have learnt earlier in 
relation to volume and capacity.

9'1 The relationship between a cubic centimetre and a millilitre

A  syringe  used  by  doctors  is  given  in  the  above  figure.  The  amount  of  liquid 
medicine injected into a patient can be identified using the scale indicated on the 
syringe.

The units of measurement are indicated as cc/ ml.
cc means “cubic centimetre”. It consists of the initial letters of these two words. A 
cubic centimetre is the volume of a cube of side length 1 cm.  

The  back  slash  (/)  means  “or”.  It  indicates  that  the  amount  of  medicine  can  be 
expressed  in  terms  of  either  cc  or  ml. The  question  which  arises  immediately  is 
whether 1 cc is equal to 1 ml. In the metric system, 1 ml is defined such that it is 
equal to1 cc. Accordingly,

1 cubic centimetre = 1 millilitre

1  cm3 = 1 ml

Based on the activity the following equalities are obtained.

10 cm3 = 10 ml
           20 cm3 = 20 ml
Accordingly, it is clear that 1 cm3 = 1 ml.

This relationship can be used when solving problems related to liquid volumes in 
containers.

A cuboid shaped glass container of length 20 cm, width 15 cm and height 10 cm is 
filled with a liquid medicine.

    i.  Find the volume of the container in cubic centimetres.
   ii.  What is the capacity of the container in litres?
  iii.   If the liquid in the container is to be stored in phials of capacity 50 ml each, 
find the number of phials required to store all the liquid in the container.

  i.      The volume of the container  = 20 cm   15 cm   10 cm

= 3000 cm3

  ii.    The capacity of the container = 3000 ml

= 3 l 

  iii.         The total amount of liquid  = 3000 ml

The number of phials of capacity 50 ml each that are required = 3000   .. 50

= 60

Example 2  

800 l of water is in a cuboid shaped concrete tank consisting of a base of length 2 m 
and width 1 m. Find the height to which the water is filled in the tank.
Let us construct an equation, assuming that the tank is filled up to a height of x cm, 
and by solving it find the height to which it is filled.
Let us first convert all the measurements into centimetres. 

The length of the tank = 2 m = 200 cm 

The width of the tank  = 1 m = 100 cm

It is given that the volume of water in the tank is 800 l.

∴Volume of water in the tank = 800 l

Since the volume of water represented above in two ways is equal,

= 800 000 ml

9.2 The relationship between a litre and a cubic metre

The  need  for  a  unit  which  is  larger  than  ml  or  l  arises  when  it  is  necessary  to 
measure large volumes of liquid such as the quantity of liquid in an oil tank or a 
swimming pool. In such instances a large unit called cubic metre is used.

In order to identify a cubic metre, let us calculate the capacity of a cube shaped 
container of side length 1 m.

1 m

1 m

1 m

The capacity of the container shown in the figure = 1 m   1 m   1 m = 1 m3

   However, since 1 m = 100 cm,
the capacity of the container, 1 m3 = 100 cm   100 cm   100 cm

          = 1 000 000 cm3

= 1 000 000 ml (Since 1 cm3 = 1 ml)

 l  (Since 1000 ml = 1 l)

 =  1000 000
1000

= 1 000 l

123

For free distribution 
 
 
 
 
 
       
 
   
 
 
 
Accordingly,

one cubic metre is equal to 1000 l.

1 m3 = 1000 l

Example 3  
The internal length, width and height of a cuboid shaped tank in which water is 
stored for the daily use of a household are 1.5 m, 1 m and 1 m respectively.

  (i) What is the capacity of the tank in litres?
 (ii) If the residents use 300 l per day, for how many days will a completely filled 

tank be sufficient?

(i) The capacity of the tank = 1.5 m   1 m   1 m

= 1.5 m3
= 1 500 l (Since 1 m3 = 1000 l)

(ii)                              The volume of water used per day = 300 l

The volume of water in the tank = 1 500 l
...  The number of days for which the water is sufficient = 1 500
300

= five days

Being innovative, changing with right knowledge
Be a light to the country as well as to the world.

Message from the Hon. Minister of Education

The past two decades have been significant in the world history due to changes that 
took place in technology. The present students face a lot of new challenges along 
with the rapid development of Information Technology, communication and other 
related fields. The manner of career opportunities are liable to change specifically in 
the near future. In such an environment, with a new technological and intellectual 
society,  thousands  of  innovative  career  opportunities  would  be  created.  To  win 
those challenges, it is the responsibility of  the Sri Lankan Government and myself, 
as the Minister of Education, to empower you all. 

This book is a product of free education. Your aim must be to use this book properly 
and acquire the necessary knowledge out of it. The government in turn is able to 
provide free textbooks to you, as a result of the commitment and labour of your 
parents and elders.

Since  we  have  understood  that  the  education  is  crucial  in  deciding  the  future  of 
a country, the government has taken steps to change curriculum to suit the rapid 
changes  of  the  technological  world.  Hence,  you  have  to  dedicate  yourselves  to 
become  productive  citizens.  I  believe  that  the  knowledge  this  book  provides  will 
suffice your aim. 

It  is  your  duty  to  give  a  proper  value  to  the  money  spent  by  the  government  on 
your education. Also you should understand that education determines your future. 
Make sure that you reach the optimum social stratum through education.

I congratulate you to enjoy the benefits of free education and bloom as an honoured 
citizen who takes the name of Sri Lanka to the world.  

 Akila Viraj Kariyawasam
 Minister of Education

 Foreword

The educational objectives of the contemporary world are becoming more complex along 
with  the  economic,  social,  cultural  and  technological  development.  The  learning  and 
teaching process too is changing in relation to human experiences, technological differences, 
research and new indices. Therefore, it is required to produce the textbook by including 
subject related information according to the objectives in the syllabus in order to maintain 
the teaching process by organizing learning experiences that suit to the learner needs. The 
textbook  is  not  merely  a  learning  tool  for  the  learner.  It  is  a  blessing  that  contributes  to 
obtain a higher education along with a development of conduct and attitudes, to develop 
values and to obtain learning experiences.

The government in its realization of the concept of free education has offered you all the 
textbooks from grades 1-11. I would like to remind you that you should make the maximum 
use  of  these  textbooks  and  protect  them  well.  I  sincerely  hope  that  this  textbook  would 
assist you to obtain the expertise to become a virtuous citizen with a complete personality 
who would be a valuable asset to the country.

I would like to bestow my sincere thanks on the members of the editorial and writer boards 
as well as on the staff of the Educational Publications Department who have strived to offer 
this textbook to you.

 Direct Proportion

By studying this lesson you will be able to;

² identify direct proportions,

² solve problems related to direct proportion using the unitary method,

² solve problems related to direct proportion using the definition,

² write the relationship between two directly proportional quantities in the   
  form y = kx,

² solve problems related to the conversion of foreign currencies using the    

   knowledge on direct proportions.

10.1 Introduction to direct proportion

The way the price of a certain type of pen varies depending on the quantity of pens 
is given in the following table.  

Number of 
pens
1

2

3

6

Price (Rs)

30

45

60

75

90

It  is  clear  from  the  above  table  that  the  price  increases  as  the  number  of  pens 
increases. Let us consider the number of pens and the price as two quantities.

Based on the above example, a few ratios of different amount  of  pens and the 
ratios of the corresponding prices are shown in the following table. Observe that 
these ratios are equal. 

Ratio of two amounts of 
pens

Ratio of the corresponding 
prices

1 : 2

1 : 3

2 : 3
3 : 5

2 : 5

15 : 30  =  1 : 2

15 : 45  =  1 : 3

30 : 45  =  2 : 3
45 : 75  =  3 : 5

30 : 75  =  2 : 5

Two  distinct  quantities  are  said  to  be  in  direct  proportion  if  they 
increase or decrease in the same ratio.

Therefore,  if  two  quantities  are  in  direct  proportion,  then  when  one  quantity 
increases, the other quantity will also increase in the same ratio. 
Similarly, if two quantities are in direct proportion and one quantity decreases, then 
the other quantity will also decrease in the same ratio.

Exercise 10.1

1. For each of the cases given below, write whether the two quantities are directly 

proportional or not.
 a. The number of books and the price
 b.  The distance travelled by an object moving at a constant speed and the time  

taken for the journey.

 c. The speed of a vehicle and the time taken to travel a certain distance

 d.  The length of a side of a square and its perimeter 

 e.  The length of a side of a square and its area

 f. The number of people needed to finish a task and the number of days taken 
     for it  
 g. The number of units of electricity consumed by a household and the 
  monthly bill

10. 2 Solving problems related to direct proportion using the 
         unitary method

Suppose we want to find the price of 5 cakes of a certain type of soap, given that the 
price of 3 cakes of soap of that type is Rs 120.

As you have learnt in previous grades, we can first find the price of one cake of soap 
and thereby easily find the price of 5 cakes of soap.

Price of 3 cakes of soap  =  Rs 120
Price of 1 cake of soap  =  Rs 120  ÷ 3

=  Rs 40

Price of 5 cakes of soap  =  Rs 40  × 5

=  Rs 200

This method of calculation can also be explained as follows.

There are two quantities. They are  the  number  of  cakes  of  soap  and  the  price. 
Initially the price of one cake of soap is found. It is Rs. 40. To find the price of five 
cakes of soap, the price of one cake of soap is multiplied by 5. Here the price of one 
cake of soap is clearly the constant value of the following fraction.

price of 3 cakes of soap

number of cakes of soap

The method of solving a problem based on the value of a unit is called the 
unitary method.

Let us learn how to solve problems related to direct proportion using the unitary 
method by considering a few examples.

Example 1  
If a person walking at a constant speed takes 5 minutes to walk 800 m, calculate the 
distance he walks in 12 minutes. 

Distance walked in 5 minutes in metres =   800
Distance walked in 1 minute in metres =   800 ÷ 5 

=   160

Distance walked in 12 minutes in metres  =   160 × 12     

∴	The distance walked in 12 minutes is 1920 m.

=   1 920

Example 2  
If the mass of 10 identical balls used in a cricket match is 3 kg, what is the mass of 
3 such balls?

Mass of 10 balls in kilogrammes =  3

Mass of 1 ball in grammes =  3000 ÷ 10 

=  300

Mass of 3 balls in grammes =  300 × 3  

=  900

∴	 The mass of 3 balls is 900g. 

Do the following exercise using the unitary method. 

Exercise 10.2

1.  If the price of 8 oranges is Rs 320, find the price of 5 such oranges.

2.  If the price of 5 m of a certain fabric is Rs 750, find the price of 12 m of that  

fabric.

3.  If the mass of a parcel containing 15 apples is 3.6 kg, find the mass of a parcel 

containing 8 such apples.

4.  If a printing machine makes 240 copies in 5 minutes, determine the number 

of   copies it makes in 12 minutes.

5.  If a motor vehicle moving at a constant speed travels 12 km in 15 minutes,  

calculate the distance it travels in 40 minutes.

6.  If a motorbike can travel 90 km on 2 l of petrol, find the distance it can travel 

on 5 l of petrol.

7.  If the time taken for a tank of capacity 1000 litres to be filled using a pump that 
releases water at a constant rate is 5 minutes, find the time taken in seconds to 
fill a tank of capacity 1600 litres.

10.3 Solving problems related to direct proportion using the definition

In the first section of this lesson it was explained that if two quantities are directly 
proportional, then the ratio of any two values of the first quantity is equal to the ratio 
of the corresponding values of the second quantity. This can be shown algebraically 
as below. Let us assume that the price of an amount a of a certain item is Rs u and 
the price of an amount b of the same item is Rs v.

a

b

u

v

Then we can write a : b = u : v.
This can be expressed in terms of fractions as a
b
By cross multiplication, a × v = b × u
Let us learn how to solve problems related to direct proportion using this  feature 
by considering the following examples.

v  ( or  b
u

v
a = 
u

 ).  

 = 

Example 1  
If the price of 5 mangoes is Rs 75, find the price of 8 mangoes. 

Let us take the price of 8 mangoes as x. Then we can illustrate this information 
using an arrow diagram as shown below. 

Number of mangoes 

       Price (Rs)

5        

8 

      75

      x

Using this as the base, let us write an algebraic equation as shown below and by 
solving it, find the value of x; that is, the price of 8 mangoes. 

5 : 8 = 75 : x

Therefore,  

  = 

75
x

5
8
5x = 75 × 8

x = 

75 × 8
5

x = 120

Accordingly, the price of 8 mangoes is Rs 120.

Example 2  
Find the price at which an item bought for Rs 500 should be sold to earn a profit of 
15%. 

Let us write the information in this problem as follows, so that we can use direct 
proportions. “If the selling price of an item bought for Rs 100 is Rs 115 (since the 
profit is 15%), find the selling price of an item bought for Rs 500.”

Let us assume that the selling price of an item bought for Rs 500 is Rs x.

  Purchase price (Rs) 

 Selling price (Rs)

           100        

           500 

        115

       x

100 : 500 = 115 : x

100
500

= 

115
x

  100 x  = 115 × 500

x = 

115 × 500
100

x = 575

Accordingly, the selling price should be Rs 575.

Exercise 10.3

1. For each of the proportions given below, write the suitable value in the blank 
    space. 

a.   2 : 5 = 8 : ...... 
  c.   5 : 3 = 40 : ...... 
 e.   8 : ...... = 24 : 15 

 b.  3 : 4 = ...... : 20  
d.  4 : 1 = ...... : 8
f.   ...... : 6 = 35 : 30

2.  Solve  each  problem  given  below  using  proportions,  by  first  drawing  an  arrow 

diagram and then writing an algebraic equation. 

a.   If the price of 10 kg of rice is Rs 850, find the price of 7 kg of rice. 

b.    If the mass of 9 cm3 of a certain type of metal is 108 g, find the mass of         

12 cm3 of this metal.

c.  If the distance travelled in 4 hours by a motorbike moving at a constant speed

is 240 km, find the distance travelled by it in 3 hours. 

d.   Find the amount needed to buy an item worth Rs 800 from a shop which 

offers a discount of 3%.

e.   If a commission of 12% is given when an item is sold, what is the 

commission given for an item worth Rs 15 000?

f.   If the price of 4 pencils is Rs 48, find the number of pencils that can be 

bought for Rs 132.

g.   If the price of 12 bottles is Rs 4800, find the number of bottles that can be 

bought for Rs 6000.

10.4 Solving problems related to direct proportion algebraically

If the price of 1 pen is Rs 15, then

² the price of 2 pens is Rs 30.
² the price of 3 pens is Rs 45.
² the price of 4 pens is Rs 60.

If  we  consider  the  above  four  instances,  it  can  be  observed  that  if  the  amount 
of money spent is divided by the number of pens, the value that is obtained is a 
constant. 

That is, 

money spent
number of pens

 = constant value.

This constant value is the price of one pen. Accordingly, if the money spent for x 
pens is y, 

we can write 

y
x  = k ;  here k is a constant.

This equation can also be written as y = kx. 

Let us learn how to solve problems related to direct proportions using the above 
algebraic equation, by considering the following examples.

7

For free distribution.  
 
 
 
 
Example 1  
If the price of 3 exercise books is Rs 75, find the price of 5 such exercise books. 
Let us take the number of books as x and the price as y.  

Then we can write y = kx; where k is a constant. The value of k can be found using 
the information given in the problem.  

Since the price of 3 exercise books is Rs 75, when x = 3, y = 75.

By substituting these values in the equation we obtain, 75 = k × 3.
By solving this we obtain k = 25.

By  substituting  this  value  of  k  in  the  first  equation,  we  obtain  the  relationship 
between x and y as y = 25x.

Now, using this equation, for any value of x the corresponding value of y and for 
any value of y the corresponding value of x can be found.
In this problem, since we need the price of 5 exercise books, y needs to be found 
when x = 5.

By substituting x = 5 in the equation y = 25x we get,

y = 25 × 5 
= 125 

Accordingly, the price of 5 exercise books is Rs 125. 

Example 2  

If a vendor sells an item he bought for Rs 500 such that he earns a profit of 20%, 
determine the selling price of the item.

y
Taking the purchase price of the item as x and selling price as y we can write 
x

  =  k'

Since the selling price is Rs 120 when the purchase price is Rs 100, we obtain
120
100
Let us assume that the selling price of an item bought for Rs 500 is y. Then we 

 =  k.

obtain the equation 

y
500  =  k'

8

For free distribution. 
Since k is a constant, we can write, 

y
500 = 

120
100

. 

Therefore, y = 

120 × 500
100

.

y  = 600.

∴ The selling price of the item is Rs 600. 

Exercise 10.4

Do the problems in this exercise, using the algebraic equation method. 

1. If the price of 3 shirts is Rs 1200, find the price of 5 shirts.

2.  If the daily wage of 8 labourers who are paid equal wages is Rs 7200, find the

number of drink bottles it produces in 7 hours. 

5. A bookstore offers a discount of 8% on every book that is purchased. Find the 

amount a person has to pay if he purchases books worth Rs 1 200.

10.5 Foreign currency

We know that every country has its own currency unit and that the rate of conversion 
of the currency of one country to that of another country varies depending on the 
countries. The rate at which one country exchanges its currency with that of another 
country is called the exchange rate. This rate is not a constant value; it increases 
and decreases daily due to various reasons.

The currency units used by certain countries and their exchange rates with respect 
to the Sri Lankan rupee on a particular day, is given below.

Here the exchange rate given is the value of one foreign currency unit in Sri Lankan 
rupees.

Now  let  us  consider  how  to  solve  problems  related  to  exchange  rates  using 
proportions. 

Example 1  
On a day that the exchange rate is Rs 151 for an American dollar, how many Sri 
Lankan rupees will a person who converts 50 American dollars receive? 

Value of 1 American dollar  = Rs 151 
Value of 50 American dollars = Rs 151 × 50

= Rs 7550

Therefore, the person will receive Rs 7550.
Example 2  
A person visiting England, converted Rs 74 000 into sterling pounds on a day when 
the exchange rate was Rs 185 for a sterling pound. How many sterling pounds did 
he receive?

The value of 185 Sri Lankan rupees  = 1 sterling pound

The value of 1 Sri Lankan rupee =  

 sterling pounds  

The value of 74 000 Sri Lankan rupees = 

 × 74 000 sterling pounds 

=  400 sterling pounds 

1
^ It is easy to simplify this if we keep 
185
a decimal number&. Therefore, the amount of sterling pounds he received is 400.

Do the following exercise by using the exchange rate table given earlier.

1. If the monthly salary of a person working in a foreign country is 1500 American 

dollars, what is his salary in Sri Lankan rupees?

2.  If the price of a television set imported from Japan is 12 500 yen, what is its value 

in Sri Lankan rupees?

3.  A monthly allowance of 2500 sterling pounds is given to a scholarship student 
engaged  in  further  studies  in  Great  Britain.  How  much  is  this  amount  in  Sri 
Lankan rupees?

4.  A sports equipment in a duty free shop is worth 750 euros. How many Sri Lankan 

rupees have to be paid to purchase it?

5.  A pilgrim who travels to India, converts 56 000 Sri Lankan rupees into Indian 

rupees. How many Indian rupees does he receive?

6.  How  many  Singapore  dollars  are  received  when  readymade  garments  worth        

Rs 600 880 are exported from Sri Lanka to Singapore?

The Calculator

By studying this lesson you will be able to"
 ² identify and use the keys of =, %, x2 and  x  in the  scientific calculator.

The Calculator

Since  ancient  times,  humans  have  used  various  devices  to  perform  calculations. 
During the period when animal husbandry commenced, men used pebbles to count 
the number of animals they owned. There is evidence to show that counting was 
done by drawing lines on clay tablets during a later period. The Egyptians started 
using a device known as the abacus for calculations in 1000 B.C. The modern day 
abacus was invented by the Chinese in the 15th century. John Napier who lived 
in the 17th century invented “Napier’s bones” which is a device that was used to 
calculate products and quotients of numbers.   

      Egyptian abacus    

      Modern abacus

The  first  mechanical  calculator  was  invented  by  the  French  mathematician 
Blaise  Pascal(1623-1662).  In  the  year  1833,  the  Englishman  Charles  Babbage                 
(1791-1871) introduced a more advanced calculator. Based on this, the electrically 
operated computer was invented. The production of the modern compact calculators 
commenced with the development of electronics.

calculators  and  the  scientific  calculators.  Ordinary  calculators  can  perform  only 
normal  mathematical  operations  such  as  addition,  subtraction,  multiplication, 
division  and  square  roots.    However,  by  using  a  scientific  calculator,  operations 
such as x2, x3   yx

 The Scientific Calculator 

The scientific calculator, like the ordinary calculator, consists of a key pad to enter 
data and a screen to display results. However, the number of keys on the keypad and 
the number of digits that can be displayed on the screen of a scientific calculator are 
greater than those of an ordinary calculator.

Simplify each of the following using a calculator. Indicate the order in which the 
keys need to be pressed to obtain the correct answer.

a.  45 + 205 
 b.   350 − 74  
  c.   824 × 95

     l.    0.006 ÷ 0.33 × 0.12

Performing  calculations  using  an  ordinary  calculator  or  a 
scientific calculator

Let us consider how simplifications are done using a calculator when more than one 
operation is involved. 

In simplifying 75 + 6 ÷ 3 using an ordinary calculator, when the keys are pressed 
in the order

ON

7

 , the operations are performed 
in the order that they have been entered and 27 is obtained as the answer. That is, a 

+

6

=

÷

5

3

wrong answer is obtained by 75 + 6 ÷ 3 = 81 ÷ 3 = 27. 
(This is wrong according to the “BODMAS Rule”.)

When  we  enter  the  above  data  in  a  scientific  calculator  in  the  same  order, 

the  operations  are  performed    according  to  the  accepted  order  of  performing 

mathematical operations and the answer 77 is obtain by performing the operations 

as follows: 75 + 6 ÷ 3 = 75 + 2 = 77. 

Note:  When  performing  calculations  using  an  ordinary  calculator,  the  order  in  which 
data is entered should be chosen with care. However, the correct answer can be 
obtained  when  data  is  entered  into  a  scientific  calculator  in  the  order  in  which 
they appear. Most manufacturers of calculators follow the BODMAS rule when 
programming  their  products.  However,  there  are  some  calculators  that  do  not 
perform  the  operations  according  to  this  rule.  The  order  in  which  data  should 
be  entered  into  these  calculators  is  indicated  in  the  instruction  booklet  that  is 
provided. If such a booklet is not available, an understanding of how the calculator 
operates can be gained by performing a few simple calculations. Otherwise, the 
operations that need to be performed initially have to be enclosed within brackets. 
For example, if the data in the expression 1  − 5 + 12 ÷ 3 × 2  is entered in the 
given order, some calculators may perform the multiplication before the division.  
However, according to the BODMAS rule, since multiplication and division have 
the same priority, moving from left to right, the division should be peformed first.

                       Indices

By studying this lesson you will be able to;

• 

• 
• 

identify the laws of indices on the product of powers, the quotient of powers 
and the power of a power,
simplify algebraic expressions using the above mentioned laws of indices,
identify the zero index and negative indices and simplify algebraic expressions
containing these.

 Indices

You have learnt about powers of numbers such as 21, 22 and 23 in previous grades. 
The values of these powers can be obtained as follows.

21 = 2
22 = 2   2 = 4 
23 = 2   2   2 = 8
. 
. 
. 

.
.
.

You have also learnt about powers of algebraic symbols such as x1, x2 and x3 .These 
can be expanded and written as follows.

x1 = x
x2 = x   x 
x3 = x   x   x
. 
. 
. 

.
.
.

Moreover, you have learnt how to write the expanded form of a product of powers 
of  algebraic  symbols  and  numerical  values.  For  example,  52a3b2    is  written  in 
expanded form as follows.

52a3b2 = 5   5   a   a   a   b   b'

You have also learnt that a power of a product such as  (xy)2 can be expressed as a 
product of powers as x2 y2 and a power of a quotient such as  x
y
as a quotient of powers as x
y

12.1 Products of  powers with the same base

23 and 25 are two powers with the same base.
They can be expanded and written as follows.

   23 = 2   2   2 and
  25 = 2   2   2   2   2 

Let us obtain the product of these two powers.

  23   25 = (2   2   2)   (2   2   2   2   2)

  = 2   2   2   2   2   2   2   2
  = 28

2 is repeatedly multiplied three times in 23. Furthermore, 2 is repeatedly multiplied 
five times in 25. 
22

For free distribution. 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
          
                                                                     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
           
                                                                   
 
 
 
 
 
 
Therefore, when multiplying 23 by 25, 2 is repeatedly multiplied     3 + 5 = 8 times. 

This can be expressed as 23   25 = 23 + 5 = 28.

It  is  important  to  remember  that  when  two  powers  are  multiplied,  their  indices 
can be added only if they have the same base. Then the base of the power that is 
obtained is also this common base.

Let us obtain the product x3 × x5  accordingly. Since x3 and x5 have the same base, 
the two indices are added to get the product. 
That is, x3   x5   = x3 + 5

 = x8

This can be expressed as a law of indices as follows.

am   an   = am + n

This law can be extended to any number of powers. 
For example,

am   an   ap = am + n + p   

Let us understand how this law is used to simplify expressions by considering some 
examples.

Example 1  

Simplify the following.

i. x2   x5   x 

      ii. a2   b2    a2   b3                 iii. 2x2   3x5  

i. 
    x2   x5   x = x2 +  5 + 1  

        ^ since x = x1&               

  = x8

iii. 

 2x2   3x5  = 2   x2   3   x5 
= 2   3   x2   x5 
= 6x2 + 5
= 6x7 

ii.  
     a2   b2   a2   b3 = a2   a2   b2   b3

= a2 + 2   b2 + 3
= a4   b5
= a4 b5

same base, similar to the one obtained above for the product. 
x5  ..x2 can also be expressed as x5

x2 ' 

Now, x5

x   x   x   x   x
x   x

x2 = 
 = x   x   x
 = x3

...  x5
x2 = x3' When the index of the power in the numerator is 5 and the index of the 
power in the denominator is 2, then the index of the quotient is 5 – 2 = 3. The base 
of the quotient is x, which is the common base of the original two powers.

Therefore, x5  .. x2 can be simplified easily by subtracting the indices as follows. 

 x5  .. x2 = x5 – 2  = x3

When powers with the same base are divided, the index of the divisor is subtracted 
from the index of the dividend. The base remains the same.

am  .. an = am – n

It is important to remember this law of indices too. 
Let us understand how this law is used to simplify expressions by considering the 
following examples.

Example 1  
Simplify the following expressions.

  a. x5   x2  .. x3

   (x5   x2)  .. x3 = x5 + 2   .. x3

= x7 – 3
= x4

b. 4x8  .. 2x2

   4x8  .. 2x2 = 
1

12.3 Negative indices

In the previous section we identified that x5  .. x2 is x3. We know that this can be 
obtained by expanding x5
x2  and simplifying it as follows.

Let us simplify x2  .. x5 in a similar manner.

ii. Using laws of indices,

x2
x5  = x2 – 5
= x – 3 

The  two  simplifications  of  x2  ..  x5 obtained  in  (i)  and  (ii)  above  must  be  equal. 
Therefore,  1
x3  = x – 3. Observe here that the index of the power in the denominator 
changes  signs  when  it  is  brought  to  the  numerator.  This  is  an  important  feature 
related to indices which can be used when we need to change a negative index into 

a positive index. We can similarly write x3 = 

1
x – 3  . 

This law can be expressed as follows.

Accordingly,  a –m

1
am=

,

a m
  =

 a–m
 a–n

=

  (By applying the above feature 
 to both powers simultaneously)

We can use this law of indices to simplify algebraic expressions as shown in the 
following examples.

A power of which the index is zero, is known as a power with zero index. 20 is an 
example of a power with zero index.

When x5  .. x5 is simplified using the laws of indices we obtain,

x5  .. x5 = x5 – 5 = x0

When it is expanded and simplified we obtain,  x5  .. x5 =  x   x   x   x   x
x   x   x   x   x 

Since the answers obtained when x5  .. x5  is simplified by the two methods should 
be the same, we obtain x0 =  1'

=  1

x0 = 1 where, x is any number except 0'

This result is also used when simplifying algebraic expressions.

 Note:

 i. x0   x7

Let  us  improve  our  skills  in  simplifying  expressions  which  contain  powers  with 
zero index by doing the following exercise.

12.5 Power of a power

(x2)3 is the third power of x2 . A power of this type is known as a power of a power.
We can simplify this as follows.

        (x2)3  = x2   x2   x2 

(x2)3  = (x   x)   (x   x)   (x   x) 
= x   x   x   x   x   x
= x6

Therefore, (x2)3 = x6'
Observe  that  the  index  6  is  3  twos;  that  is,  2  ×  3.  Therefore,  we  can  write                            
(x2)3  = x2   3 = x6'
Hence, when simplifying an algebraic expression of a power of a power, the indices 
are multiplied.
This is also a law of indices which can be expressed as follows.

  (am)n = am   n = amn

Example 1  
Simplify the following.

 i.  (a5)2   a 

 ii.  (p3)4   (x2)0  

iii.  (2x2y3)2

                 = p12   x 0 
                 = p12   1 
                = p12

Introduction 

	It	is	the	opinion	of	scientists	that	dinosaurs	are	a	species	of	animals	that	lived	on	

earth	140	000	000	years	ago.

	The	atomic	radius	of	the	Hydrogen	atom	is	0.000	000	000	053	m.

	The	distance	from	the	sun	to	the	earth	is	149	600	000	000	m.

	The	speed	of	light	is	299	790	000	meters	per	second.

The	above	are	four	instances	where	numbers	have	been	used	to	provide	information.	
Using	the	information	in	the	last	two	statements,	let	us	find	the	time	taken	for	a	light	
ray	from	the	sun	to	approach	earth.

Time	=149	600	000	000	÷	299	790	000	seconds.	

Since	there	are	many	digits	in	each	of	these	numbers,	they	are	lengthy.	Therefore	
more	space	is	required	to	write	them	and	computations	such	as	the	above	become	
difficult.	Since	a	calculator	can	display	only	a	limited	number	of	characters,	it	is	
difficult	to	do	such	calculations	even	with	an	ordinary	calculator.	Therefore	the	need	
arises	to	represent	such	numbers	in	a	more	concise	way	to	facilitate	calculations.

In	this	lesson	we	will	learn	a	method	of	writing	these	numbers	in	a	concise	way	so	
that	it	is	easy	to	manipulate	them.	Let	us	first	do	the	below	given	review	exercise	
to	recall	the	facts	that	have	been	learnt	in	previous	grades	which	are	relevant	to	this	
lesson.

Power	of	10

Writing	a	number	with	many	digits	in	this	manner	as	a	product	of	two	numbers,	
where	one	is	between	1	and	10	or	1	and	the	other	is	a	power	of	10,	is	known	as	the	
scientific	notation.	

If A	is	a	number	between	1	and	10	or	1	and	n	is	an	integer,	then	A × 10n 
is	a	number	written	in	scientific	notation	(Here 1 ≤	A	<	10).

Let	us	write	280	000	in	scientific	notation.	

Taking	the	first	couple	of	digits	in	280	000	and	writing	it	as	a	number	between	1	
and	10	we	get	2.8.	

∴	280	000	=	2	80000

=	2.8	×	100	000										
=	2.8	×	105																						  

Therefore	280	000	expressed	in	scientific	notation	is	2.8 ×	105	'

The	total	area	of	Sri	Lanka	is	65	610	km2.

13.2  Writing a number between 0 and 1 in scientific notation

Consider	the	pattern	given	below.	

10	000	=	104																																																															

1000	=	103
100	=	102
10	=	101
1	=	100
1
0.1	=	10

1
		=	 101

	=	10−1 

1
0.01	=	100

1000

1
		=	102
1
		=	 103

0.001	=	

	=	10−2            

It	is	clear	that,

when	writing	0.1	as	a	power	of	10	the	index	is	−1

	=	10−3  

when	writing	0.01	as	a	power	of	10	the	index	is	−2

when	writing	0.001	as	a	power	of	10	the	index	is	
−3.

0.75	 is	 a	 number	 which	 is	 less	 than	 1.	When	 it	 is	 written	 in	 terms	 of	 a	 number	
between	1	and	10,	it	should	be	written	as	7.5	divide	by	10.	The	way	this	is	done	
mathematically	can	be	expressed	as	follows.

36

for free distribution. 
 
 
Since	0.75	×	10	=	7.5,	

7.5
0.75	=	 10

7.5
=	 101

					(Since	10	=	101)	

1
=	7.5	×	10−1							(Since	 101

=	10−1	)

Accordingly,	 the	 number	 0.75	 has	 been	 expressed	 as	 the	 product	 of	 a	 number	
between	1	and	10	and	a	power	of	10.

∴	0.75	expressed	in	scientific	notation	is	7.5	×	10−1 '

In	the	same	manner,	let	us	write	0.0034	in	scientific	notation.	

Since	0.0034	×	1000	=	3.4,

0.0034	=	

=

3.4
1000
3.4
103

=	3.4	×	10−3   

Note: When	a	number	between	0	and	1	is	written	in	scientific	notation,	the	index		

of	the	power	of	10	is	a	negative	integer.

13.3 Converting numbers expressed in scientific notation to 
        general form

As	an	example,	let	us	convert	the	number	5.43	×	104		written	in	scientific	notation	
to	general	form.	

Method I 
5.43	×	104	=	5.43	×	10000														

Method II

Since	it	is	multiplied	by	104,	(that	is	10	000)												
shifting	 the	 decimal	 point	 4	 places	 to	 the	
right,	we	obtain	54300.

=	54	300

∴	5.43	×	104	=	54300

Another	example	is	given	below.	This	is	an	instance	where	the	index	of	the	power	
of	10	is	a	negative	number.	

Method I 

1
5.43	×	10−4 =	5.43	×	 104

Method II 

								Since	it	is	divided	by	104,	shifting	the	decimal	  

=	5.43	÷	10000	

								point	4	places	to	the	left	we	obtain	0.000543.

=	0.000543																								

0	.000543

Example 1

Convert	the	following	numbers	to	general	form.	

(i)	8.9	×	103	

(ii)	8.9	×	10−3

(i)	8.9	×	103	=	8.9	×	1000 

1
(ii)	8.9	×	10−3	=	8.9	× 103

=	8900												8900. 	

=	0.0089											0.0089

Here	for	example,	8.9	×	103	can	be	directly	written	as	8	900.	When	multiplying,	
if	the	index	of	the	power	of	10	is	a	positive	integer,	then	the	decimal	point	should	
be	 shifted	 to	 the	 right,	 the	 same	 number	 of	 positions	 as	 the	 index	 (adding	 zeros	
if	 necessary).	 When	 multiplying,	 if	 the	 index	 of	 the	 power	 of	 10	 is	 a	 nagative 
integer,	then	the	decimal	point	should	be	shifted	to	the	left,	the	same	number	of	
positions	as	the	index.

 Rounding off numbers

The	number	of	tickets	that	were	sold	over	the	weekend	to	those	who	attended	the	
exhibition	mentioned	in	the	news	item	was	2	4	8	3.	Accordingly,	the	actual	number	of	
people	who	attended	the	exhibition	is	2	483.	The	number	2	500	which	is	mentioned	
in	the	news	item	is	a	number	which	is	close	to	2	483,	easy	to	remember	and	has	a	
special	feature.	Moreover	it	is	sufficient	to	communicate	an	idea	of	the	number	that	
attended	the	exhibition.	

Rounding	 off	 a	 number	 means	 representing	 the	 value	 of	 the	 number	 by	 a	 value	
which	 is	 close	 to	 it,	 which	 is	 simple	 and,	 easy	 to	 remember	 and	 communicate.	
There	are	many	ways	of	rounding	off	numbers.	Let	us	consider	a	few	of	them.

13.4 Rounding off to the nearest 10

Representing	 a	 number	 by	 the	 multiple	 of	 10	 which	 is	 nearest	 to	 it	 is	 known	 as	
“rounding	off	to	the	nearest	10”.

Let	us	round	off		2	483,	which	is	the	number	of	people	who	attended	the	exhibition,	
to	the	nearest	10.	The	number	2	483	lies	between	the	two	multiples	of	ten,	2	480 
and	2	490.	However	it	is	closer	to	2	480	than	to	2	490.	Accordingly,	when	2	483 is 
rounded	off	to	the	nearest	10,	we	obtain	2	480.	

We	can	describe	this	more	generally	as	follows.	

When	rounding	off	2	481,	2	482,	2	483	and	2	484	to	the	nearest	10	we	obtain	2	480.	
This	is	because	the	multiple	of	10	which	all	these	numbers	are	closest	to	is	2	480.	
Similarly,	if	we	round	off	2	486,	2	487,	2	488	and	2	489	to	the	nearest	10	we	obtain	
2	490.	The	reason	for	this	is	also	the	same	as	the	above.	Even	though	the	remaining	
number	2	485	is	at	an	equal	distance	from	the	two	multiples	of	ten	2	480	and	2	490,	
when	rounding	it	off	to	the	nearest	10,	the	convention	is	to	round	it	off	to	the	nearest	
10	which	is	greater	than	it,	that	is,	to	2	490.	Finally,	it	is	clear	that	when	2	480	is	
rounded	off	to	the	nearest	10	we	obtain	2	480	itself	and	when	2	490	is	rounded	off	
to	the	nearest	10	we	obtain	2	490	itself.

take.

13.5 Rounding off to the nearest 100 or 1000

“Rounding	off	to	the	nearest	100”	or	“to	the	nearest	1000”	is	defined	in	the	same	
way	that	“rounding	off	to	the	nearest	10”	was	defined.

For	example,	the	number	7	346	is	between	the	two	multiples	of	hundred,	7	300	and										
7	400	and	is	closer	to	7	300	than	to	7	400.	Therefore	when	7	346	is	rounded	off	to	
the	nearest	100,	we	obtain	7	300.	Similarly,	if	we	round	off	7	675	to	the	nearest	100	
we	obtain	7	700.	In	general,	if	we	round	off	a	number	from	7	300	to	7	349	(both	
included)	to	the	nearest	100	we	obtain	7	300,	and	if	we	round	off	a	number	from														
7	350	to	7	400	(both	included)	to	the	nearest	100	we	obtain	7	400.	

Now,	let	us	consider	how	to	round	off	numbers	to	the	nearest	1000.	For	example,	
when	41	873	is	rounded	off	to	the	nearest	1000	we	obtain	42	000.	The	reason	for	
this	is	because	41	873	is	closer	to	42	000	than	to	41	000.

It	must	be	clear	to	you	by	this	time,	what	occurs	when	we	round	off	numbers.	Now	
let	us	consider	a	method	that	can	be	used	to	round	off	numbers	easily.

2425

 The	two	multiples	of	100	between	which	2425	lies	are	2400	and	2500.		The	
value	of	2425	is	less	than	the	value	of	2450	which	is	exactly	at	the	centre	
between	these	two	multiples	of	100.		Therefore,	2425	is	closer	to	2400	than	
to	2500.

Accordingly,	when	2425	is	rounded	off	to	the	nearest	100	we	obtain	2400.

•		Let	us	round	off	2485	to	the	nearest	100.

2485

	The	two	multiples	of	100	between	which	2485	lies	are	2400	and	2500.	The	
value	of	2485	is	greater	than	the	value	of	2450	which	is	exactly	at	the	centre	
between	these	two	multiples	of	100.		Therefore,	2485	is	closer	to	2500	than	
to	2400.

Accordingly,	when	2485	is	rounded	off	to	the	nearest	100	we	obtain	2500.

•		Let	us	round	off	2450	to	the	nearest	100.

2450

 The	two	multiples	of	100	between	which	2450	lies	are	2400	and	2500.		The	
number	2450	is	exactly	at	the	centre	between	these	two	multiples	of	100.		
According	to	the	convention,	the	number	which	is	at	the	centre	is	rounded	
off	to	the	nearest	multiple	of	100	greater	than	that	number. 

Accordingly,	when	2450	is	rounded	off	to	the	nearest	100	we	obtain	2500.

•			Let	us	round	off	2485	to	the	nearest	1000.

2485

 The	two	multiples	of	1000	between	which	2485	lies	are	2000	and	3000.	The	
value	of	2485	is	less	than	the	value	of	2500	which	is	exactly	at	the	centre	
between	 these	 two	 multiples	 of	 1000.	 	Therefore,	 2485	 is	 closer	 to	 2000	
than	to	3000. 

Accordingly,	when	2485	is	rounded	off	to	the	nearest	1000	we	obtain	2000.

for free distribution.•	 Let	us	round	off	2754	to	the	nearest	1000.

2754

  The	two	multiples	of	1000	between	which	2754	lies	are	2000	and	3000.		
The	value	of	2754	is	greater	than	the	value	of	2500	which	is	exactly	at	the	
centre	between	these	two	multiples	of	1000.		Therefore,	2754	is	closer	to	
3000	than	to	2000.

Accordingly,	when	2754	is	rounded	off	to	the	nearest	1000	we	obtain	3000.

•	 Let	us	round	off	12	500	to	the	nearest	1000.

12500

  The	 two	 multiples	 of	 1000	 between	 which	 12	 500	 lies	 are	 12	 000	 and	 
13	 000.	 	 The	 number	 12	 500	 is	 exactly	 at	 the	 centre	 between	 these	 two	
multiples	of	1000.		According	to	the	convention,	the	number	which	is	at	the	
centre	is	rounded	off	to	the	nearest	multiple	of	1000	greater	than	that	number.

Accordingly,	when	12	500	is	rounded	off	to	the	nearest	1000	we	obtain	13	000.

 Rounding off decimal numbers

When	the	mass	of	a	5	year	old	child	was	measured,	it	was	12.824	kg.	If	we	write	
this	in	grammes,	it	is	12	824	g.	This	value	was	obtained	because	the	scale	used	for	
this	purpose	gives	the	mass	to	the	nearest	gramme.	However,	for	practical	purposes	
44

for free distribution. 
 
the	 mass	 is	 usually	 required	 to	 the	 nearest	 kilogramme,	 to	 the	 nearest	 10th	 of	 a	
kilogramme	or	to	the	nearest	100th	of	a	kilogramme.	

It	 is	 useful	 to	 know	 how	 to	 round	 off	 any	 given	 decimal	 number	 to	 the	 nearest	
whole	number,	nearest	first	decimal	place,	nearest	second	decimal	place,	etc.	In	this	
lesson	we	will	learn	how	to	round	off	decimal	numbers.	

Initially,	 let	 us	 consider	 how	 to	 round	 off	 a	 number	 with	 one	 decimal	 digit	 to	 a	
whole	number.	
Let	us	round	off	12.7	to	the	nearest	whole	number.	

12

12.1

12.2

12.3 12.4

12.5

12.6 12.7

12.8

12.9

13

The	whole	numbers	on	either	side	of	12.7	are	12	and	13.	

centre

Since	the	numbers	12.1,	12.2,	12.3	and	12.4	are	closer	to	the	whole	number	12	than	
to	the	whole	number	13,	when	these	numbers	are	rounded	off	to	the	nearest	whole	
number	we	obtain	12.	Similarly,	since	the	numbers	12.6,	12.7,	12.8	and	12.9	are	
closer	to	13	than	to	12,	when	these	numbers	are	rounded	off	to	the	nearest	whole	
number	we	obtain	13.	Furthermore,	as	in	the	above	sections,	12.5	rounded	off	to	the	
nearest	whole	number	is	accepted	by	convention	to	be	13.	Accordingly,	when	12.7	
is	rounded	off	to	the	nearest	whole	number	we	obtain	13.

Similarly,
12.3	rounded	off	to	the	nearest	whole	number	is	12	and
12.5	rounded	off	to	the	nearest	whole	number	is	13.	

Rounding off to a given decimal place
Round	off	3.74	to	the	nearest	first	decimal	place.

In	3.74,	the	digit	in	the	first	decimal	place	is	7	and	the	digit	in	the	second	decimal	
place	 is	 4.	When	 rounding	 off	 to	 the	 first	 decimal	 place,	 the	 digit	 in	 the	 second	
decimal	 place	 is	 considered	 and	 the	 digit	 in	 the	 first	 decimal	 place	 is	 adjusted	
accordingly	if	necessary.	
The	rule	used	here	for	rounding	off	is	similar	to	that	used	in	the	previous	sections.	
Since	 the	 number	 with	 one	 decimal	 digit	 which	 is	 closest	 to	 the	 numbers	 3.71,	
3.72,	3.73	and	3.74	is	3.7,	when	these	numbers	are	rounded	off	to	the	first	decimal	
place	we	obtain	3.7.	Similarly	when	the	numbers	3.75,	3.76,	3.77,	3.78	and	3.79	are	
rounded	off	to	the	first	decimal	place	we	obtain	3.8.	Accordingly,	3.74	rounded	off	
to	the	first	decimal	place	is	3.7.	

45

for free distribution. 
The	rule	for	rounding	off	numbers	to	other	decimal	places	is	also	the	same.	Let	us	
consider	the	following	example.	

Example 2

	Round	off

i. 3.784	

	 ii. 3.796	

to	the	nearest	second	decimal	place.

When	rounding	off	to	the	nearest	second	decimal	place,	the	digit	in	the	third		
decimal	place	needs	to	be	considered.	

i.				3.784	lies	between	3.78	and	3.79.	Since	3.784	is	closer	to	3.78	than	to	3.79,		
						when	it	is	rounded	off	to	the	nearest	second	decimal	place	we	obtain	3.78.

ii.	 3.796	lies	between	3.79	and	3.80.	Since	3.796	is	closer	to	3.80	than	to	3.79,	
						when	it	is	rounded	off	to	the	nearest	second	decimal	place	we	obtain	3.80.

    Loci and Constructions

By studying this lesson you will be able to,

 ²  
 ²  
 ²  
 ²  
 ²  

identify four basic loci,
construct a line perpendicular to a given line,
construct the perpendicular bisector of a straight line segment,
construct and copy angles,
solve problems related to loci and constructions.

Loci

A few motions that you can observe in the environment are given below. Let us 
consider the path of each motion. 

1' Cotton floating in the air
2' A bird flying
3'  A ball hit by a bat
4' A fruit falling from a tree
5' The tip of a hand of a working watch
6' A child riding a see-saw

You  may  observe  that  even  though  the  motions  of  1  and  2  are  complex  and 
unpredictable, the motions of 3 to 6 have a definite path. It is important to learn 
about loci in geometry to develop a proper understanding of the paths of the objects 
undergoing these motions.

A set of points satisfying one or more conditions is known as a locus.

14.1  Basic Loci

Now let us consider four basic loci.

1. The locus of points which are at a constant distance from a fixed point.

Activity 1

Step 1:     Take a strip of cardboard of length 5 cm, 
make  two  small  holes  near  the  two  ends 
and name them O and A. 

A

O

Step 2:     Keep the above strip of cardboard on a 
piece  of  paper,  place  a  pin  through  the 
hole O and keep it firm on the piece of 
paper.

A

O

Step 3:      Place  a  pencil  point  through  the  hole  A  and 
while holding the pin tightly so that it doesn’t 
move,  move  the  pencil  and  mark  the  path  it 
takes.

O

A

Step 4:      At the end of the activity, identify the locus that 
                  is obtained.

In the above activity, you would have obtained a circular path. 
Accordingly,

  The locus of points on a plane which are at a constant distance from a fixed 
point is a circle.

Example 1    

Draw a sketch of the locus of the bottommost point of the bob of a 
pendulum in a working pendulum clock.

The locus relevant to this motion is a part of a circle with centre 
the fixed point of the rod/string to which the bob is connected and 
radius the distance from this fixed point to the bottommost point 
of the bob.

2.   The locus of points which are equidistant from two fixed points.

Activity 2

Step 1:   Draw a straight line segment of length 10 cm on an oil paper/tissue paper 

and name it AB.

A

B

Step 2:     Identify  the  axis  of  symmetry  of  the  straight  line  AB  by  folding  the 
tissue paper such that the two points A and B coincide and mark it with 
a dashed line. 

A

B

Step 3:     Mark a point P1 on the dashed line, draw the straight lines P1A and P1B, 

and measure and write their lengths. 

P1

A

B

Step 4:     Mark several more points on the dashed line and measure and write the 
distances from the points A and B to each of these points.

A

P1

P2

P3

B

Step 5:     Check whether the distances from the points A and B to each of these 

points on the dashed line are equal and write your conclusion. 

When folding the paper as above, such that A and B coincide, observe that the fold 
line  obtained  is  perpendicular  to  AB  and  that  it  passes  through  the  midpoint  of 
AB. This line is called the perpendicular bisector of the line segment AB. Observe 
further that the distances from the points A and B to any point you chose on the 
perpendicular bisector are equal. 

The locus of points which are equidistant from two given points is the 
perpendicular bisector of the line joining the two points.

Example 2    
Draw a rough sketch of the locus of points which are equidistant from the two given 
points P and Q. Name five points on the locus as P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5.

Step 4:   Using a straight edge, join the above marked points P, Q and R.

too.

It is clear  from  the  above activity that,  the  locus of a point  at  a   constant distance 
of 3 cm from the line AB is a straight line parallel to the line AB and at a distance of 
3 cm from it. Moreover, two loci can be drawn on either side of AB. 

The locus of points which are at a constant distance from a straight line are 
the two straight lines parallel to it and at the given constant distance from 
it, on either side of it.

measure their lengths and write them down.

into two equal angles and that the distances from any point on the line OX to the

14.3 Constructing lines perpendicular to a given straight line

Let us explain two phrases that are commonly used in constructions. When drawing 
a circle using a pair of compasses, phrases such as “taking a certain point as the 
centre”  and  “taking  a  certain  length  as  the  radius”  are  often  used.  For  example, 
“Taking point A as the centre” means the circle or arc should be drawn with the 
point of the pair of compasses kept at the point A; and “Taking AB as the radius” 
means that the distance between the point of the pair of compasses and the pencil 
point should be equal to the length of AB.

through the midpoint of that line segment, was identified earlier as the perpendicular

By  now  we  have  learnt  to  draw  angles  using  the  protractor.  However  we  can 
construct  a  few  special  angles  by  using  a  straight  edge  and  a  pair  of  compasses 
only. Let us recall how we constructed a regular hexagon in grade 8 by using a pair 
of compasses. 

C

B

Here, taking the length of a side of the regular 
hexagon which needs to be drawn as the radius,

Since OX and OY are radii of the circle with centre O, OX = OY. 
Similarly, since XO and XY are radii of the circle with centre X, XO = XY.
Accordingly, OX = XY = OY.
Therefore, OXY is an equilateral triangle.

15.1 Solving linear equations with two types of brackets

You may have observed that there are some equations with brackets in the review 
exercise. In this lesson we expect to learn how to solve linear equations with two 
types  of  brackets.  Let  us  first  consider  how  to  construct  a  linear  equation  with 
several brackets and find its solution.

Note: There are several types of brackets that we use.

{     }

When applying brackets, the usual practice is to first use parentheses, then curly 
brackets and finally square brackets.

“The result of adding three to a certain number and subtracting one from twice this 
value, and finally multiplying the resulting value by five and adding two is equal 
to 47”.
Let us consider how to construct an equation using the above information and then 
solve it.

If the number is x, when 3 is added, we obtain x + 3.

Twice this expression can be written as 2(x + 3) using parentheses.
The expression that is obtained when 1 is subtracted from this is 2(x+3) −1. 

Using curly brackets to write five times this expression we obtain,

5{2 (x + 3) – 1} 

It is given that when 2 is added to this expression it is equal to 47. Therefore,

5{2 (x + 3) – 1} + 2 = 47

Now, by solving this equation, let us find the value of the number (x).

First, by simplifying the expression with parentheses we obtain

 5{2x + 6 – 1}+ 2 = 47.

When we simplify the expression within curly brackets we obtain, 

5{2x + 5} + 2 = 47.

Now, simplifying the expression with curly brackets we obtain

10x + 25 + 2 = 47.
10x + 27        = 47

Subtracting 27 from both sides we obtain,  

10x + 27 – 27 = 47 – 27.

That is,  10x = 20 . 
Dividing both sides by10 we obtain,

20
10x
10  = 
10
         x = 2  

Therefore, the number is 2.

Let us consider a few more examples of equations with brackets to improve our 
skills of solving such equations.

            2                   2

        3(2x – 1) + 4 = 19

6x – 3 + 4  = 19 (simplifying the expression with parentheses)      

                  6x + 1 = 19 

6x + 1– 1 = 19 – 1 (subtracting 1 from both sides)

      5{4x + 12 – 2x + 2} = 72   (simplifying the expression with parentheses)

 5{2x + 14} = 72   

10x + 70 = 72   (simplifying the expression with curly brackets)

10x + 70 – 70 = 72 – 70 (subtracting 70 from both sides)

15.2 Solving linear equations containing fractions

Now, let us consider how to construct a linear equation with fractions and find its 
solution.

A  vendor  bought  a  stock  of  mangoes  to  sell.  He  discarded  10  fruits  which  were 
rotten. The rest he divided into 12 equal piles of 5 mangoes each. 

Let us construct an equation using the above data. 

If the vender bought x mangoes to sell,
when 10 mangoes are discarded, the remaining amount is x – 10.
The number of piles that can be made when the remaining mangoes are divided into 
groups of 5 is x – 10

 . It is given that the number of piles is 12. 

5

Therefore,  x – 10

5

 = 12 

Now, let us solve this equation and find x.
x – 10
5

 = 12 

Multiplying both sides of the equation by 5,

5   x – 10
5
     x – 10 = 60

 = 12   5

Adding 10 to both sides,

x – 10 +10 = 60 +10
          x = 70

Therefore, the vendor bought 70 mangoes to sell.

Let us study the following examples to learn more on solving linear equations with 
fractions.

15.3  Solving simultaneous equations

You have learnt in previous grades and in the earlier section of this lesson how to 
find the value of the unknown by solving a linear equation.
In this section we will learn how to solve linear equations with two unknowns.

Suppose it is given that the sum of two numbers is 6.

If  we  take  the  two  numbers  as  x  and  y,  then  we  can  construct  the  equation                             
x + y = 6, based on the given statement.
Here, x and y are not unique. The following table shows several different pairs of 
values of x and y which satisfy the above equation.

By observing the above table, we can conclude that there are infinitely many pairs 
of values of x and y which satisfy the equation x + y = 6.
If there is another relationship between x and y, we can construct another equation 
and by solving both equations simultaneously we can find the values of x and y that 
satisfy both equations.

For free distribution. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Suppose it is given that the difference of the two numbers is 2. If we take the larger 
number as x, we can construct the equation x – y = 2 , based on the given statement.

There are infinitely many pairs of values of x and y which satisfy this equation too 
as can be concluded from observing the following table.

Table 2
By observing Tables 1 and 2, you can see that there is only one pair of values of x 
and y which satisfies both x + y = 6 and x – y = 2. This pair is x = 4 and y = 2. 
Therefore, the solution of the above two equations is x = 4 and y = 2.

A pair of equations of this type with two unknowns is known as a pair of simultaneous 
equations. “Simultaneous” means “occurring at the same time”.  
Let  us  learn  how  to  solve  pairs  of  simultaneous  equations  using  several  other 
methods which are shorter, by considering the following examples.

Example 1

Solve the pair of simultaneous equations x + y = 6 and x – y = 2.  

To facilitate finding the solution, let us label the two equations as  1  and  2  '
x + y = 6 
x – y = 2 

   1  
  2

Method I

We can name this method “the method of substitution”.
By making x the subject of equation  2  , we can write it as  

x = 2 + y'

By substituting this expression for x in equation  1   we obtain, 

 2 + y + y = 6.
2 + 2y = 6

This is a linear equation in one unknown.

79

               For free distribution.   
 
 
Let us find the value of y by solving it.

2 – 2 + 2y = 6 – 2 

                        2y = 4
2y
4
2  = 
2
              y = 2

We can now find the value of x by substituing y = 2 in  x = 2 + y'

x = 2 + 2
x = 4

Method II
This method can be named “the method of elimination”.

x + y = 6 
x – y = 2 

   1  
  2

First, observe that + y occurs in equation (1) and − y occurs in equation  2 .
By adding both equations we get
x + y + x – y = 6 + 2

Here  we  have  used  the  axiom  “Quantities  which  are  obtained  by  adding  equal 
quantities to equal quantities, are equal”.

Now we obtain a linear equation in x, since + y and –y cancel off. 
Let us solve it and find the value of x.

       2x = 8
8
    2x
2 = 
2
      x = 4

To find the value of y, let us substitute x = 4 in equation  1 ,

  4+ y = 6

        4 – 4 + y = 6 – 4                             x = 4
         y = 2                                  y = 2

Note that in the above pair of simultaneous equations, the coefficient of y was 1 in 
one equation and −1 in the other. That is, the numerical values of these coefficients 
are equal (when the signs are ignored).

Let us consider a few more examples. We will use the 2nd method to solve them. 

Example 2

Solve 2m + n = 10
             m – n = 2   '

2m + n = 10 
   m – n = 2  

   1  
  2

Adding  1  and  2 , 2m + n + m – n = 10 + 2
                                  3m = 12
12
3m
3 = 
3
        m = 4

By substituting m = 4 in  1 ,
2   4 + n = 10
     8 + n = 10

n = 10 – 8                                  m = 4
n = 2                                          n = 2

Example 3

Solve 2a + b = 7
            a + b = 4'

2a + b = 7 
   a + b = 4  

   1  
  2

In these equations, the coefficient of b is equal. Therefore, to eliminate b, we must 
subtract one equation from the other.

1  –  2 ,  2a + b – (a + b) = 7 – 4 (As there is a subtraction, it is essential to use

        brackets and write (a + b))

      2a + b – a – b = 3
      a = 3

By substituting a = 3 in   2 ,

       3 + b = 4

    b = 4 – 3
    b = 1

  Solve  x + 2y = 11 
              x – 4y =  5 '

   x + 2y = 11  
   x – 4y =  5 

   1  

  2

Here the coefficients of x are equal. Therefore, let us subtract one equation from the 
other to eliminate x. 

1  –  2 , x + 2y – (x – 4y) = 11 – 5

        x + 2y – x + 4y = 6

          x + 2  = 11
     x + 2 – 2 = 11 – 2

an acute triangle since every angle is less than 90o.

Draw an acute triangle, a right triangle and an obtuse triangle in your exercise 
book and in each triangle, mark an exterior angle and the relevant interior opposite

Formulae

By studying this lesson you will be able to; 

change the subject of a formula,

• 
•	 find	the	value	of	a	variable	term	in	a	formula	when	the	values	of	the	other	

variables	are	given.

Introducing formulae

In	 grade	 8	 you	 learnt	 Euler’s	 relationship	 which	 is	 an	 equation	 expressing	 the	
relationship	between	the	number	of	edges,	number	of	vertices	and	number	of	faces	
in	a	solid.

This	relationship	is	the	following.

  Number	of	edges	=	Number	of	vertices	+	Number	of	faces	–	2

By	taking	the	number	of	edges	as	E,	the	number	of	vertices	as	V	and	the	number	of	
faces as F,	this	relationship	can	be	expressed	as	follows.

E =	V	+	F –	2

A	relationship	between	two	or	more	quantities	expressed	as	an	equation,	is	known	
as	a	“formula”.

The	quantities	in	a	formula	are	known	as	variables.	In	general,	a	formula	is	written	
with	just	one	variable	which	is	called	the	“subject	of	the	formula”	on	one	side	of	
the	equal	sign	(usually	the	left	hand	side),	and	the	remaining	variables	on	the	other	
side.		For	example,	in	the	formula	E =	V	+	F	–	2	stated	above,	E	is	the	subject.	

97

For free distribution.	
 
Let	us	consider	another	formula.	Temperature	can	be	expressed	in	degrees	Celsius	
or	degrees	Fahrenheit.	The	relationship	between	these	two	units	is	given	below.

F	=		9
5

 C +	32	

Here, F	denotes	the	temperature	in	Fahrenheit	and	C	denotes	the	temperature	in	
Celsius.	The	subject	of	this	formula	is	F.	

Some	 formulae	 that	 are	 frequently	 used	 in	 Science	 and	 Mathematics	 are	 given	
below.

 p		 =		2	(a	+	b)	

 v		 =		u	+	at 
 s		 =		n
2
 y		 =		mx	+	c

	(a	+	l)

 C		=		2	πr

A		 =		πr2

17.1 Changing the subject of a formula

E is	the	subject	of	the	formula	E	=	V	+	F –	2.	If	required,	we	can	make	either	V 
or F the	subject	of	this	formula.	This	can	be	done	in	a	manner	similar	to	solving	
equations	by	using	axioms.

As	an	example,	let	us	make	V the subject of the formula E	=	V	+	F–	2.	
V	is	on	the	right	hand	side	of	this	equation.		F and	–	2	are	also	on	the	same	side	of	
the	equation	as	V.	To	remove	the	terms	F and	–	2	from	the	right	hand	side,	let	us	
add	–	F and	+	2	to	both	sides	of	the	equation.

We	then	obtain, E +	(–F)	+	2	=	V	+	F –	2	+	(–F	)	+	2	'

Now,	by	simplifying	both	sides	we	obtain,
E –	F + 2 = V      (	since	F+ (–F	)		=	0		and	–	2	+	2	=	0)

The subject V	appears	on	the	right	hand	side.
Since	 the	 subject	 is	 usually	 written	 on	 the	 left	 hand	 side,	 we	 re-write	 the	 above	
equation	as	follows	with	V	on	the	left	hand	side.
V	=	E	–	F	+	2

The	following	examples	show	how	the	subject	of	formulae	of	various	forms	are	
changed.
98

For free distribution.   
Example 1

Make	a the subject of the formula v = u + at '

Here	the	variable	a	is	multiplied	by	the	variable t.	Therefore,	we	need	to	first	make	
the term at	the	subject.
Subtracting	u	from	both	sides	of	v	=	u	+	at we	obtain

v − u = u + at − u
 v −	u = at

Now	by	dividing	both	sides	by t to	make	a	the	subject	we	obtain,

v − u
t

 = at
t

By	simplifying	this	we	get	the	formula	a =  v − u

t

 with	a	as	the	subject.

Example 2                                            
Make	n the subject of the formula S	=		n
2

	(a	+	l)	'

S	=		n
2

	(a	+	l).	

Here,	the	variable	n	which	is	to	be	made	the	subject	is	divided	by	2	and	the	result	is	
multiplied	by	(a +	l).	Therefore	both	sides	of	the	formula	need	to	be	multiplied	by	
2	and	divided	by	(a	+	l)	to	make	n	the	subject.

By	multiplying	both	sides	by	2	we	obtain,

2S =	21          

n
21   		(a	+	l)

2S = n(a	+	l) 

Now,	by	dividing	both	sides	by (a	+	l) we	obtain

Example 3  
Make	n the subject of the formulal l = a + (n − 1)d'

l = a + (n − 1)d

Let	us	consider	the	variable	n	which	is	to	be	made	the	subject.	Observe	that	the	right	
hand	side	of	the	formula	is	formed	by	subtracting	1	from	n	to	obtain	(n − 1),	then	
multiplying	(n − 1)	by	d	to	obtain	(n − 1)d	and	finally	adding	a	to	(n − 1)d.

To	make	n the	subject,	we	need	to	perform	the	inverse	operations	corresponding	
to	 the	 arithmetic	 operations	 performed	 in	 the	 above	 three	 steps	 (i.e.,	 the	 inverse	
operation	“addition”	of	the	operation	“subtraction,	the	inverse	operation	“division”	
of	the	operation	“multiplication”,	etc.),	starting	from	the	last	step	and	moving	up.	

Expressed	in	another	way,	this	means	that	we	make	n	the	subject	of	the	formula	by	
using	the	relevant	axioms.

Therefore,	let	us	first	subtract	a	from	both	sides	of	the	equation	and	simplify.
  l = a +  (n − 1)d
l − a = a + (n − 1)d −	a 
l −	a = (n − 1)d

Now	let	us	divide	both	sides	by	d	and	simplify.

l −	a

     l −	a
∴

d

 =	(n − 1)d

If	 required,	 you	 may	 simplify	 the	 right	 hand	 side	 further,	 using	 a	 common

17.2 Substitution

Suppose	that	the	values	of	all	the	variables	in	a	formula	except	one	are	given.	By	
substituting	these	values	in	the	formula,	the	value	of	the	unknown	can	be	found.

Let	us	determine	the	number	of	edges	in	a	solid	with	straight	edges,	which	has	6	
vertices	and	5	faces.

The	triangular	prism	shown	above	is	an	example	of	such	a	solid.

We	can	find	the	number	of	edges	by	substituting	the	values		V	=	6	and	F	=	5	in	the	
formula E = V	+	F –	2.

Substituting	V	=	6	and	F	=	5	in	the	formula	we	obtain, 
E =	6	+	5	–	2	

=	9	

Therefore,	the	solid	has	9	edges.

101

For free distribution. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Let	us	consider	more	examples.

There	are	two	methods	that	can	be	used	to	find	the	value	of	an	unknown	variable	
when	the	values	of	the	remaining	variables	are	given.	The	first	method	is	to	substitute	
the	given	values	in	the	formula	as	it	is,	and	then	find	the	value	of	the	unknown.	
The	 second	 method	 is	 to	 first	 make	 the	 unknown	 of	 which	 the	 value	 is	 to	 be	
determined	the	subject	of	the	formula,	and	then	find	its	value	by	substituting	the	
given	values.	

Let	us	now	consider	how	the	value	of	an	unknown	in	a	formula	is	found	using	these	
two	methods.

Example 1    
Determine	the	number	of	vertices	there	are	in	a	solid	that	has	7	faces	and	12	edges.

We	need	to	use	the	formula	E	=	V	+	F	–	2	here.	The	values	of	F	and	E	are	given	and	
we	need	to	find	V.		We	can	use	either	of	the	above	mentioned	two	methods	to	find		
V.	That	is,	we	can	first	substitute	the	given	values	in	the	formula	E =	V +	F	–	2	and	
then	find	the	value	of	V	by	solving	the	resulting	equation,	or	we	can	first	make V the 
subject	of	the	formula	and	then	substitute	the	given	values	and	simplify.

Let	us	consider	both	methods.
Let	us	take	the	number	of	edges	as	E,	the	number	of	vertices	as	V	and	the	number	
of faces as F.

Method 1
     E 	=		V	+	F –	2
Substituting	E	=12	and	F =	7	we	obtain

12	=	V	+	7	–	2
12	=	V	+	5

	12	–		5	=	V
7	=	V
V	=	7	

∴	The	number	of	vertices	is	7.	

Method 2

First	 make	 V  the  subject  of  the 

formula  and	 then	 substitute	 the	
values.

E	=		V	+	F –	2

E	+	2	=	V	+	F

  E	+	2	–  F	=	V

  V = E + 2	–	F
  V	=	12	+	2	–	7
  V	=	7	

∴	The	number	of	vertices	is	7.

Note:   One	reason	for	changing	the	subject	of	a	formula	is	because	the	value	of	
the	unknown	can	then	be	found	easily	by	directly	substituting	the	given	
values.

Measuring the diameter and the circumference of a circle

The total length of the boundary of a circle, or the perimeter of a circle is known as 
its circumference.

A  circular  ring  made  from  a  metal  wire  of  length  25  cm  is  shown  in  the  above 
figure. Since the length of the wire is 25 cm, the perimeter or the circumference of 
the circle is 25 cm. 

We cannot directly determine the diameter of a circle.

Do the following activities to identify different methods of finding the diameter of 
a circle. 

Activity 1

(a) - Measuring the diameter of a circle using a straight edge with a cm/mm scale.

Step1:   Draw  any  circle  using  the  pair  of  compasses  and  mark  its 
centre. 

Step2:   Draw a diameter and measure its length using a straight edge with 

a cm/mm scale. 

(b) - Measuring the diameter by means of an axis of symmetry of a circular lamina.

Step 1:   Draw a circle on a piece of paper using an object like a coin or a 

bangle and cut it out.

Step 2:  Fold  the  circular  lamina  into  two  equal  parts  (such  that  the  two 

parts coincide) and mark the axis of symmetry on it.

Step 3:  Since  the  axis  of  symmetry  is  a  diameter  of  the  circle,  measure 
the  length  of  the  axis  of  symmetry  and  obtain  the  length  of  the 
diameter.

the ruler. Find the diameter of the bangle using the two readings 
denoted by A and B.

a  circle  as  shown  in  the  figure.  The  distance

18.1 Measuring the circumference of a circle

Do the following activities in order to find out the methods used to measure the 
circumference of a circular lamina such as a coin.

Activity 2

1.  Mark  a  point  on  a  piece  of  thread  and  with  the  thread 
stretched, place it around the circular lamina until it reaches 
the initial point that was marked. Mark the final point on 
the  thread  when  it  coincides  with  the  initial  point,  and 
measure the length between the two points marked on the 
thread to find the circumference of the coin.

2. Draw a straight line on a piece of paper. 
Keep it on a flat surface. Mark a point on 
the  circumference  of  the  circular  lamina 
and  also  on  the  straight  line.  Place  the 
circular  lamina  on  the  straight  line  such 
that the two marks coincide and then role 
it along the straight line until the point marked on the circular lamina  touches 
the line again. The length of the circumference is obtained by measuring the 
distance the circular lamina has moved along the straight line.

Developing a formula for the circumference of a circle

Do  the  following  activity  to  identify  the  relationship  between  the  circumference 
and the diameter of a circle.

Through  the  above  activity  you  would  have  obtained  a  value  for 

  which  is 

approximately  3.14  for  every  object  you  considered.  Mathematicians  have 
c
discovered that 
  is a constant value for all circles. This constant value is denoted 
d
by π. It has been shown that this value is 3.14 to the nearest second decimal and is 
approximately equal to the fraction 

.

Accordingly,

  =  π .                                         

           That is,

c = πd. 

This  is  a  formula  giving  the  relationship  between  the  circumference  and  the 
diameter of a circle. A formula giving the relationship between the radius and the 
circumference of a circle can be derived as follows.
Since d = 2r we obtain c = π × 2r.

 i,e.,

c = 2πr

If the circumference of a circle is denoted by c, the diameter by d and the radius 
by r, then,

c = πd

c = 2πr

Example 1

18.2 Perimeter of a semicircular lamina

When a circular lamina is separated into two equal 
parts  along  a  diameter,  each  part  is  known  as  a 
semicircular lamina (in short, semicircle). 
The length of the curved line of a semicircle is known 
as the arc length. It is exactly half the circumference. 

r

Hence, the arc length of a semicircle of radius r = 

1
× (2πr)

1
2
= πr

It is clear from the figure that, to find the perimeter of a semicircle, the diameter 
should be added to the arc length.

   ∴ The perimeter of a semicircle = πr + 2r

Example 1

Find the perimeter of the semicircle shown in the figure. Use

  Pythagorean Relation

By studying this lesson, you will be able to;

 ² develop the Pythagorean relation by means of a right angled triangle,
 ² solve problems related to the Pythagorean relation.

Right angled triangle

If an angle of a triangle is 90o, it is called a right angled triangle. The side which 
is opposite(in front of) the right angle and which is the longest side of the triangle 
is called the hypotenuse. The other two sides  are called  the  sides  which  include  
the right angle. 

Considering the right angled triangle ABC given below;

A

>

 = 90o

AC  is the hypotenuse,
AB and BC are the sides which include the right angle.

19.2 The Pythagorean relation

A  Greek  mathematician  named  Pythagoras  introduced  the  relationship  between 
the sides of a right angled triangle. Let us understand this relationship through an 
activity. 

Activity 1

P

4 cm

Q

3 cm

R

Draw a right angled triangle PQR with QR = 3 cm and QP = 4 cm. You may use 
a set square to do this. Measure the hypotenuse PR and verify that it is 5 cm in 
lenghth. Cut three squares of side length 3 cm, 4 cm and 5 cm and paste them on 
the sides RQ, QP and PR respectively, as shown in the figure given below.

Now let us calculate the area of each square as shown below.

16 cm2

4 cm

5

c

m

Q

3 cm

R

9 cm2

The area of the square pasted on QR = 3 cm × 3 cm = 9 cm2
The area of the square pasted on QP = 4 cm × 4 cm = 16 cm2
The area of the square pasted on PR = 5 cm × 5cm = 25 cm2

Observe the relationship between the above values as given below.

the area of the 
square on PR 

=  

the area of the 
square on QR

 +  

the area of the   
square on PQ

Repeat the above activity by taking the lengths of the sides of the triangle which 
include the right angle as 6 cm and 8 cm to verify the above relationship for these 
values too.  

The Pythagorean relation for a right angled triangle can be expressed as follows. 

The  area  of  the  square  drawn  on  the  hypotenuse  of  a  right  angled 
triangle is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares drawn on the 
remaining two sides. 

Though the Pythagorean relation is shown using areas, we can write it simply in 
terms of the lengths of the sides of the triangle. Let us see how this is done.

Writing the Pythagorean relation in terms of the lengths of the side

A

B

The area of the square drawn on AB = AB × AB = AB2 
The area of the square drawn on BC = BC × BC = BC 2
The area of the square drawn on AC = AC × AC = AC 2
Therefore, according to the Pythagorean relation;

C

AC 2 = AB 2 + BC 2

We can express this as follows too.

P

Example 1

In the right angled triangle PQR, PQ = 8 cm and QR = 6 cm. Find the length of PR.

By applying the Pythagorean relation to the right angled triangle PQR,

 PR2 = PQ2 + QR2
PR2 = 82 + 62
          = 64 + 36
         = 100
PR =  100 = 10 

∴ the length of PR = 10 cm'

The area of the square drawn on the side AB  =  12 × 12 = 144 cm2  
The area of the square drawn on the side BC =  ........... = ........... cm2 
The area of the square drawn on the side AC =  ........... = ........... cm2
The sum of the areas of the squares drawn on the sides BC and BA = ......... cm2 . 
∴ The areas of the square drawn on AC is ............ (equal/not equal) to the sum of 
the areas of the squares drawn on BC and BA. 

Now let us consider some problems which can be solved using the Pythagorean 
relation.

Example 2

A 5m long straight wooden rod is in a vertical plane with one end touching the top 
of a 4m high vertical wall and the other end in contact with the horizontal ground 
a certain distance away from the foot of the wall. Find the horizontal distance from 
the  foot of the wall to the point where the rod is in contact with the ground. 

We can draw a rough sketch of this as shown below. Here the wall and the wooden 
rod are represented by BA and AC respectively. 

A

5 cm

4 cm

C

B

Applying the Pythagorean relation to the right angled triangle ABC 

AC 2 = AB 2 + BC 2
   52 = 42 + BC 2
  25 = 16 + BC 2

                               ∴ BC 2 = 9
                                 BC =  9  = 3

∴ The horizontal distance from the foot of the wall to the wooden rod is 3m.

20.1 Functions

We have come across relationships between different quantities in various situations. 
Carefully observe the relationship between the two quantities given below. 

Let us suppose that beads are sold at 10 rupees per gramme. The prices of different 
amounts of beads is shown below. 

  Beeds (g)

       Price (Rs)

     2   10 = 20
     3   10 = 30
     4   10 = 40 

Accordingly, it is clear that the price of x grammes of beeds is Rs 10x. Moreover, if 
the price of x grammes of beeds is represented by Rs y, then we can write y = 10x.

Let us take the amount of grammes of  beeds as x and the corresponding price as Rs y.

By plotting the price (y) against the amount of grammes of beeds (x) for different 
values of x using the above relationship, we obtain the following graph.

In the above function y = 10x, the index of the independent variable x is 1. Therefore 
it is called a linear function. 

When a linear function is given, the values of y corresponding to different values of 
x can be found as follows.

For each of the linear functions given below, calculate the values of y corresponding 
to the given values of x and write them as ordered pairs.

Q

Let us consider some characteristics of the above drawn graph. 

   ² The graph is a straight line
   ² It passes through the point (0, 0) 
   ² It makes an acute angle counterclockwise with the positive direction of the 
     x - axis

    ²  When any point on the line other than the origin is considered, the value of  

 of that point is a constant (a constant value).

Moreover, this constant value is equal to the coefficient m of x of a function of the 
form  y = mx. This constant value is called the gradient of the graph.

By observing the above graph, the following characteristics can be identified. 

  ²  It is a straight line graph.
  ²   The straight line intersects the y - axis at (0, 1).
  ²   The straight line makes an acute angle counterclockwise with the positive  

direction of the x- axis. The value of m of this line is + 3. This means that when 
the variable x increases by 1 unit, the variable y increases by 3 units. 

  ²   The value representing c in the equation y = 3x + 1 is + 1. The y cordinate of 
the point at which the straight line intersects the y - axis is also 1. These two 
values are equal. 

The  distance,  from  the  origin  to  the  point  where  the  straight  line  intersects  the 
 y - axis is known as the intercept. The intercept of this line is + 1. 

Accordingly, the gradient of the graph of a function of the form y = mx + c is m and 
the intercept is c.

i.   y = – 2x +5 is of the form y = mx + c. 
 Accordingly, the gradient (m) = – 2

  That is, y = −3x −2.

By observing the equations of the graphs it is clear that the gradients of the three 
graphs are the same.By observing the graphs it can be seen that the lines are all 
parallel to each other.  Therefore, it is clear that if the gradients of two or more 
linear functions are equal to each other, then their graphs will be parallel straight 
lines.

Graphs of functions given by equations of the form ax + by = c 

Now  let  us  consider  the  graphs  of  functions  given  by  equations  of  the  form                             
ax + by = c.  It is easy to prepare the table of values by writing this equation in the 
form y = mx + c.

Consider the following example.

equation 3x + 2y = 6. 

Using the graph that is drawn,

Being innovative, changing with right knowledge 
Be a light to the country as well as to the world. 

Message from the Hon. Minister of Education 

The past two decades have been significant in the world history due to changes that took 
place  in  technology.  The  present  students  face  a  lot  of  new  challenges  along  with  the  rapid 
development of Information Technology, communication and other related fields. The manner 
of  career  opportunities  are  liable  to  change  specifically  in  the  near  future.  In  such  an 
environment,  with  a  new  technological  and  intellectual  society,  thousands  of  innovative  career 
opportunities would be created. To win those challenges, it is the responsibility of  the Sri Lankan 
Government and myself, as the Minister of Education, to empower you all.  

This book is a product of free education. Your aim must be to use this book properly and 
acquire  the  necessary  knowledge  out  of  it.  The  government  in  turn  is  able  to  provide  free 
textbooks to you, as a result of the commitment and labour of your parents and elders. 

Since we have understood that the education is crucial in deciding the future of a country, 
the  government  has  taken  steps  to  change  curriculum  to  suit  the  rapid  changes  of  the 
technological  world.  Hence,  you  have  to  dedicate  yourselves  to  become  productive  citizens.  I 
believe that the knowledge this book provides will suffice your aim.  

It  is  your  duty  to  give  a  proper  value  to  the  money  spent  by  the  government  on  your 
education.  Also  you  should  understand  that  education  determines  your  future.  Make  sure  that 
you reach the optimum social stratum through education. 

I  congratulate  you  to  enjoy  the  benefits  of  free  education  and  bloom  as  an  honoured 

citizen who takes the name of Sri Lanka to the world.

Foreword  

The  educational  objectives  of  the  contemporary  world  are  becoming  more  complex  along 

with the economic, social, cultural and technological development. The learning and teaching 

process too is changing in relation to human experiences, technological differences, research 

and new indices. Therefore, it is required to produce the textbook by including subject related 

information  according  to  the  objectives  in  the  syllabus  in  order  to  maintain  the  teaching 

process by organizing learning experiences that suit to the learner needs. The textbook is not 

merely  a  learning  tool  for  the  learner.  It  is  a  blessing  that  contributes  to  obtain  a  higher 

education along with a development of conduct and attitudes, to develop values and to obtain 

learning experiences. 

The  government  in  its  realization  of  the  concept  of  free  education  has  offered  you  all  the 

textbooks from grades 1-11. I would like to remind you that you should make the maximum 

use of these textbooks and protect them well. I sincerely hope that this textbook would assist 

you  to  obtain  the  expertise  to  become  a  virtuous  citizen  with  a  complete  personality  who 

would be a valuable asset to the country. 

I would like to bestow my sincere thanks on the members of the editorial and writer boards as 

well as on the staff of the Educational Publications Department who have strived to offer this 

textbook to you.

In Sri Lanka, a person who is 55 years or older is considered to be a senior citizen. 
Accordingly, if we denote the age of a senior citizen by t, then we can indicate this 
by the inequality t 
 55. This means that the value of t is always greater or equal 
to 55.

Let us recall what was learnt in grade 8 regarding inequalities.

x > 3 is an inequality.  This means that the values that x can take are the values that 
are greater than 3. However, if we write x 
 3 , this means that the values that x can 
take are 3 or a value greater than 3.

Similarly,  x <  3 means that the values that x can take are the values that are less 
 3 means that the values that x can take are 3 or a value less than 3.
than 3, and x 

For example, the solution set of x > 3  is the set of all numbers which are greater 
than 3. The set of integral solutions of this inequality is {4, 5, 6, 7, …}.

The three dots mean that all the integers which belong to the pattern indicated by 
the first few values belong to the solution set. Therefore, the above inequality has 
infinitely many integral solutions.

Although in mathematics it is important to represent all the solutions as a set, when 
indicating  the  integral  solutions  of  an  inequality,  it  is  sufficient  to  just  write  the 
values. For example, the integral solutions of the inequality x > 3 can be written as 
4, 5, 6, … .

The solution set of an inequality which has an algebraic term, is the set of all values 
that the algebraic term can take. Let us recall what has been learnt earlier regarding 
the solution set of an inequality, and how this is represented on a number line, by 
considering the following examples.

21.1  Inequalities of the form x + a 

 b

The following notice has been placed near a certain bridge.

—This bridge can only bear loads of less than 10 tons˜

Suppose a lorry of mass 4 tons carrying a certain load wishes to cross this bridge. 
If we take the mass of the load carried by the lorry to be x tons, then the lorry can 
safely cross the bridge only if x  + 4 < 10. In other words, if the mass of the load 
carried by the lorry is x tons, then the lorry can safely cross the bridge, only if the 
inequality x + 4 < 10 is satisfied.

We can find the mass of the load that the lorry can safely carry across the bridge by 
solving the inequality x  + 4 < 10.

Solving  an  inequality  means,  obtaining  an  inequality  equivalent  to  the  given 
inequality such that only x (or the given variable) is on one side of the inequality.

When  solving  an  inequality,  we  can  adopt  the  procedure  followed  in  solving 
equations to a large extent.

For example, we can subtract 4 from both sides of the above inequality  x  + 4 < 10.
Accordingly,
x + 4 – 4 < 10 – 4. 
When we simplify this we obtain
x < 6.

For free distribution. 
 
 
Therefore, for the lorry to safely cross the bridge, the load that it carries should be 
less than 6 tons.

Example 1

Solve  the  inequality  x  +  2  <  7  and  represent  the  integral  solutions  on  a  number 
line. 

x + 2 < 7
x + 2 – 2 < 7 – 2 (subtracting 2 from both sides)
x < 5

The integral solutions of this inequality are the integers that are less than 5. That is, 
the values 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, –1, –2, … .

These integral solutions can also be expressed as a set as {4, 3, 2, 1, 0, – 1, – 2, …}
The solution set can be represented on a number line as follows.

The maximum mass that a bag can carry is 6 kg. Nimal puts x packets of rice of

21.2  Inequalities of the form ax 

  b  

The price of two books of the same type is more than 40 rupees. If we take the 
price of one of these books as x rupees, we can represent this information by the 
inequality 2x > 40 involving x. By solving this inequality, we can find the price that 
each book could be.

When solving this type of inequalities there are some important facts that we should 
keep in mind.

Consider the following inequalities.

i.   The inequality 3 < 4 is true.
     2   3 < 2   4  (multiplying both sides by 2)
     The inequality 6 < 8 is true.

      ii.   The inequality 8 > 6 is true.

 > 

     8

     The inequality 4 > 3 is true.

 (dividing both sides by 2)

2

When  the  two  sides  of  an  inequality  are  either  multiplied  by  the  same  positive 
number or divided by the same positive number, the inequality sign does not change.

iii.  The inequality 2 < 3 is true.

 2   – 2 <  3   – 2 (multiplying both sides by – 2)
The inequality – 4 < – 6  which is obtained is false. However,  – 4 > – 6 
is true.

      iv.  The inequality 9 > 6 is true.

9
– 3  > 

6
– 3    (dividing both sides by – 3)

       The inequality – 3 > – 2 which is obtained is false. However, – 2 < – 3 

               is true.

When an inequality is multiplied or divided by a negative number, the inequality 
sign changes. That is, the sign < changes to > and the sign 

 changes to   , etc . 

Through  the  following  examples,  let  us  learn  how  inequalities  are  solved  taking 
into consideration the above facts.

Summary

²   When the two sides of an inequality are either multiplied by the same positive 
number or divided by the same positive number, the inequality sign does not 

change.

      Sets

By studying this lesson you will be able to;
• identify finite and infinite sets,
• write the subsets of a given set,
• identify equivalent sets, equal sets, disjoint sets and universal sets,
• identify the intersection and union of two sets,
• identify the complement of a set,
• represent sets using Venn diagrams.

Introduction to sets

You have learnt earlier that a set is a collection of items that can be clearly identified. 
The items in a set are called its elements. Curly brackets are used to represent sets 
in terms of their elements. If a is an element of the set A, we denote this by a   A.  
Moreover, the number of elements in the set A is denoted by n(A).

Let us recall what was learnt previously about the different ways in which a set can 
be expressed.

 1. Describing the set using a common characteristic by which the elements can be 

clearly identified

 2. Writing the elements within curly brackets
 3. Using a Venn diagram

As an example, let us consider how to write the set of all even numbers between 0 
and 10 using the above 3 methods in the given order. Let us name this set A.

1. A = {even numbers between 0 and 10} 
2. A = {2, 4, 6, 8}

3. A

The set which has no elements is known as the null set. The null set is denoted by            
{ } and also by O. The number of elements in the null set is 0. Therefore, n(O) = 0.

For free distribution. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Example 1

If P = {even prime numbers between 5 and 10}, then find n(P).
Since there are no even prime numbers between 5 and 10, P = O   and therefore 
n(P) = 0.

22.1 Finite sets, infinite sets, equivalent sets and equal sets

Finite sets and infinite sets
Two sets which have been expressed in terms of a common characteristic by which 
the elements of the set can be clearly identified, are given below.

  A = {multiples of 3 between 0 and 20}
  B = {multiples of 5}

Let us write the elements of each set within curly brackets.

A = {3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18} 

B = {5, 10, 15, 20, ...}

The number of elements in set A is 6. That is, the number of elements in this set is a 
specific number. Sets with a specific number of elements (that is, sets with a finite 
number of elements), are known as finite sets.

The number of elements in set B however, cannot be stated definitely. That is, the 
number of elements in this set is infinite. Three dots have been placed at the end 
of the list of numbers within curly brackets to denote that the set B has an infinite 
number of elements. Sets that have an infinite number of elements are known as 
infinite sets.

Example 1

For each of the sets given below, write the elements and write whether it is a finite 
set or an infinite set. 

P = {positive multiples of 6 less than 30}
Q = {polygons}

P = {6, 12, 18, 24}     n(P) = 4
Q = {triangle, quadrilateral, pentagon, hexagon, … }

Since the number of elements in the set P is finite, P is a finite set. Since the number 
of elements in the set Q is infinite, Q is an infinite set.

Equal sets
Consider the two sets given below.

A = {even numbers between 0 and 10}

B = {digits of the number 48268} 

12

For free distribution. 
These two sets can be written as follows in terms of their elements.

A = {2, 4, 6, 8}
B = {2, 4, 6, 8}

Although  the  two  sets  A  and  B  have  been  described  differently,  when  they  are 
written in terms of their elements, we get the same set. Sets which have the same 
elements are known as equal sets. Accordingly, A and B are equal sets. If two sets 
A and B are equal then we write A = B.

Equivalent sets
If the number of elements in the two sets A and B are equal, that is, if n(A) = n(B), 
then the sets A and B are known as equivalent sets.

If A and B are equivalent sets, we denote this by A~B.

Example 2

X = {odd numbers between 0 and 10}
Y = {vowels in the English alphabet}

By writing the elements of these sets, show that they are equivalent sets.

x = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}  n(X) = 5 
y = {a, e, i, o, u}  n(Y) = 5

Since  n(X) = n(Y), X and Y sets are equivalent sets.

Note :-  Although all pairs of equal sets are equivalent, all pairs of equivalent sets 

need not be equal. 

Exercise 22.1

1. From the sets given below, select and write the finite sets and the infinite sets 

separately.

i. A = {multiples of 5 from 0 to 50} 
ii. B = {integers}
iii. C ={numbers that can be written using only the digits 0 and 1}
iv. D = {digits of the number 25265}
v. E = {positive integers which are not prime}

2. Write each of the following sets in terms of their elements and then write all 
     pairs of equal sets and all pairs of equivalent sets.

 P = {positive multiples of 3 below 10}
Q = {letters of the word “net”}
R = {odd numbers between 0 and 10}
S = {digits of the number 3693}
T = {vowels in the English alphabet}
v = {letters of the word “ten”}

4.  Write 3 examples of infinite sets.

5. Write three sets which are equivalent to the set {2, 3}. 

22.2 The universal set and subsets

Subsets
When two sets A and B are considered, if all the elements in set B are also in set A, 
then set B is known as a subset of set A. 

As an example, let us consider the two sets given below which are expressed in 
terms of their elements.

 A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
B = {2, 4, 6}

Since all the elements in set B are in set A, set B is a subset of set A. This is denoted 
by B ∩ A or A ∩ B, and is read as " B is a subset of A".

Now let us consider another set C. If C = {1, 2, 7}, then not every element in C 
belongs to A. Therefore C is not a subset of A. This is denoted by C ∩ A.

Example 1

P = {multiples of 6 between 0 and 20}
Q = {multiples of 3 between 0 and 20}

Write the elements of each of the above sets and select the subset.
P = {6, 12, 18}

14

For free distribution. 
Q = {3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18}
As all the elements of P are in  Q, P is a subset of Q.

Example 2

Write all the subsets of the set X = {1, 2}.

It is evident that {1} and {2} are two subsets. Observe that {1, 2} is also a subset. 
In fact, if two sets A and B are equal, then A is a subset of B and B is a subset of A. 
Furthermore, the null set is considered to be a subset of every set.

Since the null set and the set itself are subsets of the given set, { } and {1, 2} are 
subsets of the above set X.

Accordingly, the above set X has 4 subsets which are { },{1},{2},{1, 2}.

Example 3

Write all the subsets of the set Y = {3, 5, 7}. 

{ }, {3}, {5}, {7}, {3, 5}, {3, 7}, {5, 7}, {3, 5, 7} 
There are 8 subsets.

Universal sets

In  a  study  conducted  on  the  students  of  your  school,  several  subsets  may  come 
under consideration.

The following can be given as examples.

{Students in grade 9}
{Female students}
{Students sitting for the G.C.E (O/L) examination this year}

The elements of all the above sets are contained in the set of all students of the 
school. This set can be considered as the universal set relevant to the above study. 

Let us consider another example. 

When we consider the sets of even numbers, odd numbers, triangular numbers and 
prime numbers, we see that they are all subsets of the set of integers. Therefore the 
set of integers can be considered as the universal set.

A universal set is a set which contains all the elements under consideration. 
Universal sets are denoted by ε.

15

For free distribution. 
 
As another example, suppose that the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are written on the 
6 sides of a cubic die. By rolling this die once, the score that can be obtained is one 
of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.Therefore, we obtain {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} as the set 
of possible outcomes. This is the universal set of all possible outcomes that can be 
obtained when a die is rolled once.
This can be expressed as ε = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. A few subsets of this universal set 
are given below. 

A = {odd numbers} 
B = {values greater than 4}  B = {5, 6}
C = {even prime numbers}  C = {2}

A = {1, 3, 5}

Example 4

Write a universal set for A; A = {2, 4, 6, 8}
ε = {numbers between 1 and 10}

1. Write 8 subsets of the set A = {2, 5, 8, 10, 13}.

2. Determine whether each of the following statements is true or not.

i. {1, 2, 3 } ∩ {numbers divisible by 5} 
ii.  {4, 9, 16 } ∩ {square numbers}    
iii.  {cylinder} ∩ {polygons}  
iv.  {red} ∩ {colours of the rainbow} 
v.  {solution of 2x − 1 = 7} ∩ {even numbers}  

3. Write a universal set for the set A; A = {a, e, i, o, u}

4.  For  each  of  the  following  parts,  name  a  suitable  universal  set,  such  that  the 

given sets are subsets.

i.    {5, 10, 15, 20, 25} ,  {10, 100, 100, ...}
ii.   {countries with more than 90% literacy},{countries which are not bordered

   by an ocean}

22.3 Venn diagrams

You have learnt how to represent sets in a Venn diagram in earlier grades. In Venn 
diagrams, sets are represented by closed figures. 

The universal set is represented in a Venn diagram by a rectangle as shown below. 

ε

The subsets of a universal set are represented using round or oval shaped figures 
(circles or ellipses)

We represent a subset A within the universal set as follows.

the next section on the intersecton of sets, union of sets and disjoint sets.

22.4 Intersection of sets, union of sets and disjoint sets

Intersection of sets
When two or more sets are considered, the set consisting of the elements which are 
common to all the sets is known as their intersection. When two sets A and B are 
considered, their intersection is denoted by A∩B.

As an example, let us consider the pair of sets given below,
A ={1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7} 
B ={2, 5, 6, 7}  
The set consisting of the elements common to both A and B is {2, 5, 7}.

Therefore, the intersection of the sets A and B is A∩B = {2, 5, 7}.

Example 1

M = {students of KannangaraVidyalaya who play cricket}
N = {students of KannagaraVidyalaya who play football}
Write the set M∩N in descriptive form.

M∩N = {students of KannangaraVidyalaya who play both cricket and football}
18

For free distribution.        
 
Now  let  us  consider  how  the  intersection  of  two  sets  is  represented  in  a  Venn 
diagram.
Suppose the two sets A and B have common elements. 
That  is,    A  and  B  have  a  non  -  empty  intersection.  There  should  be  a  region  to 
represent the set of elements common to both these sets. The Venn diagram depicting 
this is given below.

A

ε

B

The shaded region in the figure is common to both the sets A and B. Therefore the 
elements that are common to these two sets can be included here.

Let us consider how to represent two sets with a non-empty intersection in a Venn 
diagram, through the following example.

Example 2

Write the following two sets by listing their elements and then find their intersection. 
Represent all the elements in a Venn diagram.

P ={prime numbers between 0 and 10} 
Q ={odd numbers between 0 and 15}
P ={2, 3, 5, 7} 
Q ={1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13}

For free distribution. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Let us consider how two sets which do not have common elements represented in 
a Venn diagram.

Disjoint sets

If two sets have no elements in common, then they are known as disjoint sets. In 
other words, if two sets A and B are such that A∩B = O, then A and B are disjoint 
sets. 
Disjoint sets can be represented in a Venn diagram as shown below.

ε

A

B

As an example, let us consider the two sets shown below.
A ={2, 4, 6, 8} 
B ={1, 3, 5, 7} 
Since A∩B = O,  A and B are disjoint sets. 

A

A∩B = O

Union of sets
When two or more sets are considered, the set which consists of all the elements 
in  these  sets  is  known  as  the  union  of  these  sets.  When  two  sets  A  and  B  are 
considered, their union is denoted by A∩B.

As an example, let us consider the pair of sets given below.

A ={1, 3, 5, 7, 8}
B ={2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8} 

The union of the sets A and B is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}.
Accordingly, the union of the sets A and B is A∩B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

For free distribution. 
 
 
 
 
 
Example 1

P = {prime numbers between 0 and 10}
P = {odd numbers between 0 and 10}
Write  these  sets  in  terms  of  their  elements  and  write  P∩Q  also  in  terms  of  its 
elements. Furthermore, express the union in terms of a common characteristic of 
its elements.

P ={2, 3, 5, 7}
Q ={1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
P∩Q ={1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9}

The union expressed in terms of a common characteristic; 
P∩Q ={numbers between 0 and 10 which are either prime or odd}

Example 2

X = {students in KannangaraVidyalaya who play cricket}
Y = {students in KannangaraVidyalaya who play football} 
X∩Y={students in Kannangara Vidyalaya who play either cricket or football or

22.5 Complement of a set

Let us consider a subset A of a universal set. The set of elements in the universal set 
which do not belong to the set A is known as the complement of A. 

Consider the following example.

23

For free distribution. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If we take,
ε = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} and A = {2, 4, 6},
then the set consisting of all the elements in the universal set which are not in set A 
is {1, 3, 5, 7}.

This set is the complement of the set A. The complement of the set A is denoted by 
A'. Accordingly,
we can write, A' = {1, 3, 5, 7}.

Example 1

By considering the given universal set (ε) and its subset B, write the set B' in terms 
of its elements.
    ε ={5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35} 
   B ={10, 20, 30 }

B   = {5, 15, 25, 35}

Example 2

If ε = {birds}and
P = {birds that make nests}, then write P   in descriptive form. 
P  ={birds that do not make nests}

Now let us see how to represent the complement of a set in a Venn diagram. 

If  A  is  a  subset  of  a  universal  set,  then  A'  is  represented  in  a  Venn  diagram  as 
follows.

ε

A

A  

A   is the set of elements which belong to ε but not to A. Therefore the whole region 
in the Venn diagram which does not belong to A, belongs to A  .

The area of a parallelogram

A quadrilateral with opposite sides parallel to each other is called a parallelogram.

Suppose AB is considered as the base of the parallelogram. AB and DC (the side 
opposite AB) are parallel to each other. According to the figure, the perpendicular 
distance between these two sides is XY. Therefore, XY is the perpendicular height 
corresponding to the base AB. When BC is considered as the base, the perpendicular 
distance  between  the  parallel  sides  BC  and  AD  according  to  the  figure  is  PQ. 
Therefore, PQ is the perpendicular height corresponding to the base BC.

area of a parallelogram. 

Activity 1

Step 1:   In  your  exercise  book,  draw  a  rectangle  which  is  equal  in  size  to  that

are equal to each other. 

Area of parallelogram ABPQ = Area of rectangle ABCD

For free distribution.

31

 
              
 
 
 
    
Observe that h is the perpendicular height corresponding to the base AB.

According to these facts, a formula for the area of a parallelogram can be given as 
below.

Area of a parallelogram = Length of the base  × Perpendicular height 

       corresponding to the base

Let us now consider another method by which the areas of a parallelogram can be 
found.

The area of a parallelogram can be found by finding the areas of triangles as well.

Consider the parallelogram ABCD.

Suppose the length of the base AB is a units 
and  the  corresponding  height  is  h  units. The 
parallelogram  ABCD  is  divided  into  two 
triangles ABD and BCD by the diagonal DB.

The area of the parallelogram KLMN = 48 cm2

h = 48

                                                         h = 6

Therefore, h = 6 cm.

We have learnt how to find the area of a lamina that takes the shape of a rectangle, 
a square, a triangle, a parallelogram or a trapezium. 
Now let us consider how the area of a circular shaped lamina can be found.

To do this, let us first engage in the activity given below.

Activity 2

Step 1 :  Draw a circle of radius 6 cm on a sheet of paper.

Step 2 :    Divide the circle into the maximum possible number of sectors (about 

16) by drawing straight lines through the center. 

Step 3  :  Colour half the circle and number all the sectors consecutively as shown 

in the figure.

Step 5  :   Paste the separated sectors such that a rectangular shape (approximately) 
is  obtained  as  shown  in  the  figure.  (Understand  that  the  accuracy

Since paper is not wasted, the areas of the circle and the rectangle should be equal. 
Find the area of the rectangle as shown below by considering the radius of the circle 
as r.
The length of the rectangle that is obtained = circumference of the circle ×

2

= 2πr ×

The width of the rectangle that is obtained = r

The area of the rectangle = length × width

= πr × r  
= πr2  

  ∴  Therefore, the area of a circle of radius r = πr2 

In calculations, we use 3.142 or  

22

  for the value of π.

Therefore, r = 7 or r = − 7.

However, the radius cannot be a negative value.
Therefore, the radius of the circle is 7 cm.

           Probability

By studying this lesson you will be able to;

• identify random experiments,
• write the sample space of a random experiment,
• identify the equally likely outcomes of a random experiment,
• find the probability of an event in a sample space when the outcomes are equally
   likely.

24.1 Random experiment

Let us consider the experiment of an ordinary coin being tossed. When a coin is 
tossed, we know that the outcome will be either “head turns up” or “tail turns up”. 
That  is,  we  know  all  the  possible  outcomes  before  the  experiment  is  conducted. 
However, we cannot say with certainly whether head will turn up or tail will turn 
up. Furthermore, this experiment can be repeated any number of times under the 
same conditions. Another feature is that we will not be able to identify a pattern in 
the outcomes when the experiment is repeated. Experiments with the above features 
are called random experiments.

Random experiments have the following common characteristics.

•  The experiment can be repeated any number of times under the same  conditions.
•  All the possible outcomes of the experiment are known before the experiment is 

carried out.

•  The  outcome  of  the  experiment  cannot  be  stated  with  certainty  before  the 

experiment is carried out. 

•  When the experiment is repeated, a pattern cannot be recognized in the outcomes.

Let us consider another example.

Even though all the outcomes of the experiment of rolling an unbiased cubic die 
with its faces numbered from 1 to 6 and recording the number on the face that turns 
up are known, it is not possible before carrying out the experiment to state with 
certainty which outcome will occur. Moreover, this experiment can be repeated any 
number of times under the same conditions, but a pattern in the outcomes cannot be 
expected. Therefore, rolling an unbiased cubic die and observing the outcome is a 
random experiment.

numbered from 1 to 4, and recording the number on 
the face which touches the table.

one color and recording its colour. 

3. Throwing a ball at a target and observing whether it 

hits the target or not.

4. Planting 5 radish seeds and recording the number of 

seeds that germinate in 5 days.

5. Checking whether a door opens when a key picked 

at random from a bunch of three keys is used.

6. Tossing  a  ball  in  the  air  and  observing  whether  it 

falls to the ground.

7. Drawing out two cards from a box containing three 
cards,  each  with  one  of  the  numbers  1,  3  and  5 
written on it, and observing whether the sum of the 
two numbers on the two cards that are drawn is an 
odd number.

24.2 Sample Space

All the possible outcomes of a random experiment can be written as a set. This set 
which consists of all the possible outcomes of a random experiment is called its 
sample space. It is usually denoted by S.

For example,

in the experiment of tossing a coin and observing the side that turns up, the set of 
all possible outcomes, that is, the sample space is S = {Head, Tail}. Here N (S) = 2.

Similarly, the sample space of the experiment of observing the number which turns 
up when an unbiased cubic die with its faces numbered from 1 to 6 is rolled is  

S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

        Here N (S) = 6.

For free distribution. 
 
  
 
Example 1

Write the sample space for the experiment of rolling an unbiased tetrahedral die 
with its faces numbered from 1 to 4 and recording the number on the face which 
touches the table. 

S = ™1, 2, 3, 4š

Example 2

    n(S) = 4

Write the sample space for the experiment of drawing a bead from a bag which 
contains  two  black  beads  and  three  white  beads  marked  B1,  B2,  W1,  W2,  W3 
respectively, which are identical in all other aspects. What is the value of n(S)? 

     S =  ™ B1, B2, W1, W2, W3 š
n(S) = 5

Example 3

There are two cards such that R is written on one side and Y is written on the other 
side. The cards are tossed simultaniously and the letters turned up is recorded. Write 
the sample space of this experiment.

Getting R on both cards is denoted by (R, R) and getting R on one card and Y on the 
other is denoted as (R, Y) etc.. Accordingly, 

S =  ™(RR), (RY), (YR), (YY)š

Note:  An event is a subset of the sample space of a random experiment.

Exercise 24.2

1. Write the sample space of each of the following experiments.

i.  Randomly  drawing  a  pen  from  a  bag  which  contains  one  pen  each  of  the 
colors blue, red, black and green and recording the colour. (Assume that the 
pens are identical in all aspects except the colour)

ii.  Recording  the  number  on  the  card  that  is  drawn  at  random  from  a  bag 

containing eleven identical cards numbered 5 to 15.

iii.  Recording the number the arrow points to, when 
the disk shown in the figure is spun and allowed 
to a stop freely.

same size and shape.  Randomly drawing a toffee and recording its flavour. 

v.  Recording the sides that turn up when a coin is tossed twice.

24.3 Equally likely outcomes

When the sample space of a random experiment is considered, if each outcome is 
equally likely to occur, then that experiment is called an experiment with equally 
likely  outcomes.  The  outcomes  of  such  an  experiment  are  called  equally  likely 
outcomes.

Let us consider a cubic die with its faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Let us assume 
that the material it is made of is uniformly distributed throughout the die. Then it 
is clear that due to symmetry, each face of the die has an equal chance of turning 
up  when  the  die  is  rolled.  Similarly  for  a  coin.  Objects  such  as  these  which  are 
symmetrical and are made of a material which is uniformly distributed are called 
unbiased or fair objects. Experiments such as these, of tossing a fair coin or rolling 
an unbiased die are considered as important examples when it comes to explaining 
the theory of probability.

Consider the experiment of rolling a cuboidal die with its faces marked, 1, 2, 3, 4, 
5 and 6 and recording the number on the face that turns up. Here, the likelihood 
of the different sides turning up may not be the same. Therefore such a die is not 
considered to be a fair die. In such experiments, the outcomes are not equally likely.

Now let us consider another experiment.

It is clear that in the experiment of an unbiased cubic die with four faces painted 
red and two faces painted blue being rolled and the colour of the face that turns 
up being recorded, the chance of a red face turning up is greater than a blue face 
turning up. Therefore, the outcomes of this experiments are not equally likely.

Exercise 24.3

equally likely or not.

24.4 Probability of an event when the outcomes are equally likely

You have learnt that the probability of an outcome of a random experiment with 
equally likely outcomes is given by the following.

Probability of a 
selected outcome

=

1

total  number  of  outcomes  in  the  sample  space  of  the  random                                    

experiment

Consider  the  experiment  of  rolling  a  fair  die.  Here  the  probability  of  a  selected 
outcome is  1
6

 For example, the probability of getting 3 is   1
6

.

Now consider the event of getting an even number. Its probability can be calculated 
as  follows.  Since  there  are  three  even  numbers  and  three  odd  numbers,  and  the 
46

For free distribution.outcomes of this experiment are equally likely, the probability of getting an even 
number is  3
6

.

The probability of an event in the sample space of a random experiment with equally 
likely outcomes is given by the following.

Probability of the 
event

=

Number of elements in the event

Number of elements in the sample space

This can be written using symbols as follows. 

If the number of elements in the sample space S is n (S), the number of elements in 
the event A is n(A) and the probability of event A occurring is p(A), then

p (A) =

n (A)

n (S)

Now let us learn more by considering some examples.

Consider the experiment of observing the side that turns up when an unbiased coin 
is tossed once.

  i. Write the sample space of this experiment and find n(S).
 ii. If the event A is “head” turns up, write the elements in A and find n(A).
iii. Find p(A), the probability that head turns up.

  i. Find the probability of getting 2.
 ii. Find the probability of getting an even number.
iii. Find the probability of getting a number greater than 1.
Since the sample space is S = ™1, 2, 3, 4š" n (S) = 4.

  i.  Probability of getting 2 =  

1
4

 ii.   If B is the event of getting an even number, 

since B = ™2, 4š,  n (B) = 2.

  ∴ p (B)  = 

n (B)
n (S)

=

iii.  There are 3 numbers greater than 1. (2,  3, 4)

  Angles of a Polygon

By studying this lesson you will be able to;
 ² solve geometrical problems related to the interior angles of a polygon,
 ² solve geometrical problems related to the exterior angles of a polygon,
 ² solve problems related to regular polygons.

A  plane  figure  bounded  by  three  or  more  straight  line  segments  is  known  as  a 
polygon.  The  two  main  types  of  polygons  are  convex  polygons  and  concave 
polygons.

Convex Polygons

Concave Polygons

Some  polygons  have  special  names  by  which  they  are  identified,  which  depend 
on the number of sides they have. Accordingly, polygons which have 3, 4, 5 and 6 
sides respectively are known as triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons and hexagons. 

In previous grades you have learnt the following results on the sum of the interior 
angles of a triangle and of a quadrilateral. 

The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180o.
The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360o.

Do  the  following  review  exercise  to  further  establish  the  above  facts  learnt  on 
polygons in previous grades.

In the given figure, O is any point within the quadrilateral PQRS. By joining PO, 
QO, RO and SO we obtain 4 triangles. 
Since the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180o,

considering the triangle PQO we obtain, p + q + a = 180o,
considering the triangle QRO we obtain, r + s + b = 180o,
considering the triangle RSO we obtain,  t + u + c = 180o,
considering the triangle SPO we obtain,  v + w + d = 180o,

By adding these 4 equations we obtain, 

 (p + q + a) + (r + s + b) + (t + u + c ) + (v + w + d) = 180o   4
...  (p + q + r + s + t + u + v + w) + (a + b + c + d) = 720o 
Since a, b, c and d are angles around the point O, a + b + c + d = 360o .
...  p + q + r + s + t + u + v + w  

= 720o – 360o
= 360o

...  the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360o'

Now, to obtain an expression in terms of n for the sum of the interior angles of a 
polygon which has n sides, let us engage in the following activity.

In the above activity, you must have obtained that when the number of sides is n, 
the sum of the interior angles of the polygon is 180o   n – 360o.

Let us write the expression 180o   n – 360o as follows so that it is easier to remember.

180o   n – 360o = 90o   2n –  90o   4  

= 90o (2n – 4)
=  (2n – 4) right angles.

i.   Consider the above table and find in terms of n, the number of triangles that 
are formed by joining one vertex of an  n-sided polygon to the other vertices 
of the polygon.

ii.   Show that the sum of the interior angles of a polygon of n sides is 

180o (n – 2). 

Note:   Historically,  mathematicians  such  as  the  Greek  mathematician  Euclid, 
expressed the magnitudes of angles in terms of right angles. For example, 
the magnitude of the angle on a straight line was said to be 2 right angles 
and the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral was said to be 4 right 
angles. Accordingly, we can say that the sum of the interior angles of a 
polygon of n sides is 2n – 4 right angles. However, since we use degrees 
to measure angles and are familiar with the fact that a right angle is 90o,   
the sum of the interior angles of a polygon can be remembered as either       
90o(2n – 4) or 180o(n – 2) or any other equivalent expression which is easy 
to recall.

The side BC of the triangle ABC has been produced and point D has been marked 
on the produced line. The angle ACD
, with the straight line segment CD and the

As indicated in the figure given below, by producing the side AC too we obtain an

Since vertically opposite angles are equal, this exterior angle is equal in magnitude 
.  Either  of  these  two  angles  can  be  considered  as  the 
to  the  exterior  angle  ACD
exterior angle drawn at the vertex C of the triangle. However, DCE
is not considered 
as an exterior angle. 

>

As done above, exterior angles can be drawn at the vertices A and B of the triangle 
too.

We can define the exterior angles of a quadrilateral similarly.

By producing the side SR of the quadrilateral PQRS up to A we obtain the exterior 
angle  QRA
and  by  producing  the  side  QR  up  to  B  we  obtain  the  exterior  angle        
. Since vertically opposite angles are equal, these two exterior angles are equal.
SRB

>

Furthermore, ARB

>

is not considered as an exterior angle.

We can define the exterior angles of any polygon similarly. 

Now, through the following activity, let us determine a value for the sum of the 
exterior angles of a polygon.

Step 5:   Write  the  common  characteristic  of  the  figures  obtained  by  pasting 
the exterior angles of the polygons and write what can be concluded 
through this activity too. 

You may have observed in the above activity that for each polygon, the exterior 
angles cover the angle around a point. Accordingly, it can be concluded that the 
sum of the exterior angles of a polygon is equal to the sum of the angles around a 
point. As the sum of the angles around a point is 360°, the sum of the exterior angles 
of the above polygons is also 360°.

Now let us obtain an expression for the sum of the exterior angles of a polygon 
which has n sides.
We know that the number of exterior angles and the number of interior angles of a 
polygon with n sides is n. 

  At any vertex of a polygon, 
the interior angle + the exterior angle  = 180o.
... sum of n interior angles + sum of n exterior angles = 180o   n'
But the sum of n interior angles = (2n – 4) right angles = 180°(n − 2). Therefore,
180o(n – 2) + sum of n exterior angles = 180on 

  ...  sum of n exterior angles = 180on – 180o(n – 2)
= 180on – 180on + 360o
= 360o

Sum of the exterior angles of a polygon = 360°

Example 1

Find the magnitude of the exterior angle indicated by x, 
of the given pentagon.

80o

Sum of the exterior angles   = 360o

Scale Diagrams

By studying this lesson you will be able to;
² identify bearings,
² draw a scale diagram of locations in a horizontal plane when bearings and distances 
are given, and find unknown quantities using the scale diagram.

27.1 Bearing

Bearing is a measurement that is used to indicate a direction in a horizontal plane. 

The bearing of the point B from the point A is the angle that the direction AB makes 
with the direction of North when measured from A in a clockwise direction. The 
following figures illustrate the bearing of B from A for different locations of A and 
B. Observe that the bearing is given in three digits.

The bearing of B from A = 135o

The bearing of B from A = 300

79

For free distribution. 
Since a bearing is always less than 360°, the maximum number of digits it can have 
is  three. Therefore  the  norm  is  to  always  write  bearings  with  three  digits.  If  the 
angle is one of 1o, 2o, ..., 9o, then the bearing is written as 001o, 002o, ..., 009o  and if 
the angle is one of  10o, 11o, ..., 99o, then it is written as 010o, 011o, ..., 099o.

Accordingly bearing is,

i.   measured starting from the North,
ii.   measured in a clockwise direction,
iii.   written with three digits.

Since the North can be easily identified using a compass, bearings are used widely 
in sea and air travel. 

Let us broaden our knowledge on bearings by studying the examples given below.

Example 2
The bearing of B from A is 065o. Illustrate this information in a rough sketch and 
find the bearing of A from B.

Since the bearing of B from A is 065o, the angle drawn from the direction of North 
at A to the directionof AB in the clockwise direction is 65o.

Now, to find the bearing of A from B, a line needs to be drawn in the direction of 
North from B, and the angle that is formed when this line is rotated in a clockwise 
direction about B from the direction of North to the direction of BA needs to be 
found.

Scale 1 : 3300000

In every scale diagram, the scale to which the diagram is drawn is given, and the 
direction of North is marked. It is very important to understand what is meant by 
the scale (ratio) given in the scale diagram. For example, a scale of 1 : 500 000 
means that a distance of 500 000 cm is represented by 1 cm in the scale diagram. In 

1
500 000

th of 

other words, the distance between two points on the scale diagram is 

the actual distance between the two points. Moreover, since 500 000 cm is equal to 
5 km, the actual distance represented by 1 cm in the scale diagram is 5 km. 

Now let us learn how to draw scale diagrams by considering some examples.

Example 1

The vertices of a triangular floor area are A, B and C. The positions of the vertices 
with respect to a point P located in this area is given below. 

With respect to P,

86

For free distribution. 
 
 
² A is located 30 m away on a bearing of 000o 
² B is located 40 m away on a bearing of 120o
² C is located 45 m away on a bearing of 220o

Draw a scale diagram of the floor area using this information and find its perimeter. 

Step  1:  Mark  the  direction  of  North  at  the  top  right  hand  corner  of  the  sheet  of 

paper. 

Step  2:  Draw  a  rough  sketch  as  shown,  based  on  the

information that is given.

Step 3:   To represent the distances 30 m, 40 m and 45 m, select the scale of 1 cm 
representing 10 m, that is, the scale of 1:1000.(Here, the scale should be 
selected according to the size of the sheet of paper. Moreover, by selecting 
a  value  such  as  1000,  anyone  who  is  examining  the  scale  diagram  can 
easily get an idea of the actual distances represented in it.) 

Step 4:   For each distance that is to be represented in the scale diagram, calculate 

the corresponding length using the selected scale.

PA = 3000 × 

PB = 4000 × 

PC = 4500 ×

Step  5:  Using  a  straight  edge  with  a  cm  scale  and  a  protractor,  draw  the  scale 

diagram with a pencil as shown below.

²  First draw the line segment AP of length 3cm upwards.  
o 
²   Draw the line segment PB of length 4 cm which makes an angle of 120

clockwise with PA.

²   Draw the line segment PC of length 4.5 cm which makes an angle of 100o 

clockwisewith PB.

Step 6:   Measure  the  lengths  of  AB,  BC  and  AC. You  will  see  that  AB  =  6  cm,               
AC  =  7.1  cm  and  BC  =  6.5  cm.  Therefore  the  perimeter  of  the  scale 
diagram is 6 + 7.1 + 6.5 = 19.6 cm.

Step 7:  Using the scale 1 cm 
          Perimeter of the floor = 10 × 19.6 = 196 m

 10 m, calculate the actual length.

Example 2

A ship journeying from harbour P approaches harbour Q after travelling 100 km 
on a bearing of 048o. It then travels 125 km on a bearing of 110
 and approaches 
harbour R. Draw a scale diagram and describe the position of R with respect to P.

Step 2: Mark a point P on a sheet of paper and mark the direction of North upwards. 
88

For free distribution.  
 
 
   
 
 
²  Since the bearing of Q from P is 048o, the angle that PQ makes with the direction 

of North at P is 48o in the clockwise direction.

²  Since the bearing of R from Q is 110o, the angle that QR makes with the direction 

of North at Q is 110o in the clockwise direction.

Since the direction of North at P and the direction of North at Q are parallel, the 
o
angle formed between the direction of North at Q and PQ is 132
Therefore, PQR

 (allied angles) 

>

 = 360o − ( 132o + 110o)
= 360o − 242o 
= 118o 

Step 3: Select the scale of 1 cm representing 25 km, that is, 1: 2 500 000 to represent 
the distances 100 km and 125 km in the scale diagram. (If there is space 
on the sheet of paper, the scale of 1:1 250 000 can also be used).

Step 4:   According to the selected scale, calculate the lengths of by which PQ and 

QR are to be represented in the scale diagram.

PQ = 

100
25

 cm = 4 cm,  QR = 

125
25

 cm = 5 cm 

(When drawing scale diagrams, the magnitudes of the angles do not change.) 

Step 5:   Draw the scale diagram using a straight edge, a protractor and a pencil, 

based on the above measurements.

Step 7: Using the scale, calculate the actual length of PR.

Step 8:   The position of R can be described as follows. 

R is situated 192.5 km from P on a bearing of  082o.

Data Representation and 
Interpretation

By studying this lesson you will be able to;

 ² construct an ungrouped frequency distribution from given raw data,
 ² find the mode, median and mean of data in the form of an ungrouped frequency 

distribution,

 ² construct a grouped frequency distribution from given raw data,
 ² identify the modal class and median class from a grouped frequency distribution.

In Grade 8 you learnt how to find the mode, median and mean of given raw data. 
Do the following review exercise to recall what was learnt.

28.1 Ungrouped frequency distribution

To extract the information we require from a given set of raw data, we need to first 
organize the data in a suitable way.  For example, to find a representative value 
such as the median of a set of raw data, the data needs to be arranged in ascending 
or descending order.

When  there  are  only  a  few  values,  they  can  easily  be  arranged  in  ascending  or 
descending  order.  However  when  the  number  of  data  is  large,  arranging  them 
in  order  and  extracting  information  is  not  that  easy.  In  such  instances  it  is  more 
appropriate to use tables.

Let us consider such an instance.

The marks obtained in a test by the students of a certain class are given below.

42, 70, 68, 68, 56, 62, 74, 74. 74, 56, 62, 85, 91, 91, 74, 74, 56, 68, 68, 68, 74

This information can be tabulated as follows.

Note:  This table can be easily and accurately constructed by using tally marks.

The frequencies are shown in the third column of this table. 
Let us first consider what is meant by frequency.
94

For free distribution. 
In the above data set, the value 42 occurs once, the value 56 occurs three time, etc. 
The frequency of a value is the number of times that value occurs in the data set. 

Accordingly, if we consider the above data set,

the frequency of 42 is 1,
the frequency of 56 is 3,
the frequency of 62 is 2, etc.

An ungrouped frequency distribution is a table containing the values of a data set 
and their respective frequencies.
The  following  is  an  ungrouped  frequency  distribution  prepared  using  the  above 
data set.

The mode of the data in an ungrouped frequency distribution
You have learnt in Grade 8 that the mode of a data set is the value that is repeated 
the most in that data set.  The largest value in the frequency column of the above 
table is 6. The value corresponding to the frequency 6 is 74.  Therefore the mode of 
the above data set is 74.

The median of the data in an ungrouped frequency distribution
You have learnt that the median of a data set is the value that occurs in the middle 
when the data is arranged in ascending or descending order.  

There are 21 data in the above example. Therefore, when the data is arranged in 
ascending or descending order, the value that occurs in the middle is the 11th value.  
Now we need to find out what the 11th value is.

95

For free distribution. 
 
Let us consider how this is done.
Observe from the above table that, 

the 1st value is 42, 
the 2nd value is 56, 
the 3rd value is also 56,
'
'
'
the 6th value is 62.

Accordingly, the 11th value can be found by considering the sums of the values in 
the frequency column as shown below. 

Let  us  write  the  sums  of  the  values  in  the  frequency  column  by  the  side  of  the 
frequency table.

It can easily be seen by considering the sums of the frequencies in the frequency 
column that the value in the 11th position is 68.

When there is a large number of data, arranging it in ascending or descending order 
and identifying the middle value may not be very easy.  The following method can 
be used to identify the middle position (the position of the median).

Note: When the total number of data is an odd number, the middle position is 
          obtained from  number of data + 1

The value in the 11th position is 68. Therefore, the median of the data set is 68; that 
is, the median of the marks is 68.

The mean of the data in an ungrouped frequency distribution

You have learnt in Grade 8 that to find the mean of a data set, the sum of all the data 
values needs to be divided by the number of data values.

Let us see how the mean of the data in an ungrouped frequency distribution is found 
by considering the above example.

As indicated previously,  the value 42 occurs once, the value 56 occurs 3 times, etc. 
To find the mean, the sum of all the values has to be found.

Let us use a table of the following form to find this sum.

There are 36 values in this data set. Since 36 is an even number, when this data set 
is arranged in ascending or descending order, we obtain two middle values. In such 
a case, the median of the data set is the average of the middle two values. 

Let us first find the positions of the middle two values.

Note: When the total number of data is even, the positions of the middle two values 
          are obtained from number of data

     The value in the 18th position = 24
     The value in the 19th position = 24

28.2 Grouped frequency distributions

In this section we will identify what a grouped frequency distribution is, the need 
for grouped frequency distributions and how they are constructed.

To do this, let us consider the following example.

The marks obtained by a group of students in a certain test is given below.

83

The highest mark obtained is 83 and the lowest mark obtained is 21.
Therefore the range = 83 – 21 = 62.

101

For free distribution. 
 
   
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Since the range is large and there are many distinct data values, if we try to prepare 
an  ungrouped  frequency  distribution,  we  will  end  up  with  a  fairly  long  table.  In 
such instances we consider the range of the data set and prepare a table of intervals 
such that each data value belongs to exactly one of the intervals.  These intervals 
are called class intervals. A frequency distribution prepared using class intervals is 
called a grouped frequency distribution.

The following is an example of a grouped frequency distribution.

Class Interval Frequency

10 - 19
20 - 29
30 - 39
40 - 49

3
6
5
2

This distribution has four class intervals.

Any data value which is equal to one of 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 
belongs to the class interval 10 – 19.

Since  there  are  10  values  in  the  class  interval  10  –  19,  the  class  size  (or  class 
width) is considered to be 10. The class sizes of the other class intervals are defined 
similarly.

The frequency corresponding to the class interval 10 – 19 is 3. This means that the 
data set has only 3 values belonging to this class interval.

Now let us consider how a grouped frequency distribution is prepared.

When preparing a grouped frequency distribution, we need to first decide on either 
the size of the class intervals or the number of class intervals we want to have.

When  we  have  decided  on  the  size  of  the  class  intervals,  the  number  of  class 
intervals can be obtained as follows.

•  Find the range of the data set.
•  Divide the range by the size of a class interval. 
• The number of class intervals is the nearest whole number greater or equal to 

the above obtained value.

102

For free distribution. 
 
Consider the following example which was discussed earlier.

The marks obtained by a group of 30 students in a certain test are given below.

Suppose we want to separate this data set into class intervals of size 10. 

Let us first find the number of class intervals.

The largest value of this data set  = 83
The smallest value of this data set = 21
                                     The range  = 83 – 21

= 62

Since we want the size of the class intervals to be 10, 

the number of class intervals = 62
10

  = 6.2

 7     (when rounded off to the nearest whole number 

  greater than the obtained value) 

Accordingly,  if  we  take  the  class  size  to  be  10,  we  obtain  a  grouped  frequency 
distribution with 7 class intervals.

Since the smallest value in the data set is 21, let us prepare the frequency distribution 
starting with the value 20. The first class interval will then consist of the ten integers 
20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29. The next class interval will consist of the 
next 10 integers and so on.  

Accordingly, we obtain the following class intervals.

20 - 29

30 - 39

40 - 49

50 - 59

60 - 69

70 - 79

80 - 89

103

For free distribution. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note:   Although we commenced the first class interval from 20, we could have 
started with the value 21 too (or some other suitable value).  If we started 
with 21, the class intervals would have been 21 – 30, 31 – 40, 41 – 50, etc.

Now,  let us find the number of values that fall into each class interval by using tally 
marks.

30 - 39

Note:  It is not necessary to include the tally marks column in a frequency 
           distribution.

When we have decided on the number of class intervals, we can find the size of the 
class intervals (class size) as follows.

•  Find the range of the data set by subtracting the smallest value of the data set 

from the largest value.

•  Divide the range by the number of class intervals. (In general, the number of 

class intervals is taken to be less than 10.)

•  Round off the value that is obtained to the nearest whole number greater or 

equal to it and take this value to be the size of the class intervals.

Let  us  consider  how  to  construct  a  grouped  frequency  distribution  with  5  class 
intervals using the above data set. Let us first find the size of the class intervals.

104

For free distribution.  The largest value of this data set  = 83
    The smallest value of this data set   = 21

                      The range = 83 – 21

= 62

Since we require 5 class intervals, 

the size of each class interval = 

62
 5

  = 12.4

 13  (nearest whole number greater than the obtained 

            value) 

Accordingly, we prepare a grouped frequency distribution with 5 class intervals of 
size 13.

As shown above, we can construct grouped frequency distributions according to 
our requirements, based on the given data set.

Consider the first grouped frequency distribution we constructed. We took 20 - 29 
as the first class interval, 30 – 39 as the second class interval, etc. We were able to 
do this because there were no values between 29 and 30 or between 39 and 40, etc. 
Observe that this feature is seen in the second grouped frequency distribution we 
constructed too.

However, if we have a data set consisting of values which are lengths or times or 
masses, it is necessary to start the second class interval with the value that the first 
class interval ends, to start the third class interval with the value that the second 
class interval ends, and so on. 

105

For free distribution.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Let us now consider such an example.

The masses of 20 students in a class are given below to the nearest kilogramme.

41

Let us construct a grouped frequency distribution with 4 class intervals of size 3 
each.

Let us take the first class interval as 30 – 33, the next class interval as 33 – 36, etc.

30 - 33

33 - 36

36 - 39

39 - 42

Here, the second class interval commences with the same value that the first class 
interval  ends. The  reason  is  because  the  data  set  consists  of  masses  and  masses 
need not be integral values. For example, we may have students whose masses are 
33.2 kg, 33.5 kg, 33.8 kg, etc., which are between 33 kg and 34 kg, or 36.5 kg,    
36.9 kg, etc., which are between 36 kg and 37 kg etc. Therefore, in such situations, 
each class interval needs to commence with the same value that the previous class 
interval ends (except for the first class interval). 

Here, the first class interval ends with 33 and the second class interval commences 
with the same value 33. A question arises as to which class interval the value 33 
belongs. The value 33 can be taken to belong to either one of these two intervals. 
However, it is important to state the convention that is being used.
In this lesson we will consider the class intervals to be as follows.

Here, 

the values greater than 30 but less than or equal to 33 belong to the class interval 
30 -33,
the values greater than 33 but less than or equal to 36 belong to the class interval 
33 – 36, 
the values greater than 36 but less than or equal to 39 belong to the class interval 
36 – 39, and 
the values greater than 39 but less than or equal to 42 belong to the class interval 
39 – 42.

The grouped frequency distribution prepared according to this convention is given

Note:  When  constructing  a  grouped  frequency  distribution,  it  should  be 
remembered  that  the  class  intervals  need  to  be  selected  by  taking  the 
nature of the data into consideration.

  28.3 Finding the modal class and median class from a grouped

 frequency distribution

We learnt how to construct a grouped frequency distribution in the previous section. 
Now let us consider how the modal class and the median class can be found from a 
grouped frequency distribution.

When we are given a grouped frequency distribution, we will not be able to identify 
the mode and the median as the raw data is not available to us.  In such situations 
we consider the modal class and the median class.

The modal class is the class interval with the highest frequency.  The median class 
is the class interval to which the median belongs. 

Example 1

A grouped frequency distribution prepared with the marks obtained by a group of 
students in a certain test is given below.

From this distribution, find

i. the modal class
ii. the median class.

i.   Since the highest frequency is 11, the modal class is 51 – 60.

ii.  The position of the median of the data set = 

35 + 1

The median class is the class interval to which the 18th value belongs. Therefore, 
the median class is 41  - 50. 

= 18

Example 2

A grouped frequency distribution prepared using the ages of the employees of a 
certain establishment is given below.
Find,
i. the modal class
ii. the median class.

∴ the modal class = 34 − 41

ii.    

     The positions of the middle two values = 

28

For free distribution. 
 
 
 
 
The class interval that contains the 14th value  = 34 − 41
The class interval that contains the 15th value  = 34 − 41
∴ the median class 34 - 41'

Foreword

The educational objectives of the contemporary world are becoming more 

complex along with the economic, social, cultural and technological development. 

The learning and teaching process too is changing in relation to human experiences, 

technological  differences,  research  and  new  indices.  Therefore,  it  is  required  to 

produce  the  textbook  by  including  subject  related  information  according  to  the 

objectives in the syllabus in order to maintain the teaching process by organizing 
learning  experiences  that  suit  to  the  learner  needs.  The  textbook  is  not  merely 

a learning tool for the learner. It is a blessing that contributes to obtain a higher 

education along with a development of conduct and attitudes, to develop values and 

to obtain learning experiences.

The government in its realization of the concept of free education has offered you 

all the textbooks from grades 1-11. I would like to remind you that you should make 

the maximum use of these textbooks and protect them well. I sincerely hope that this 

textbook would assist you to obtain the expertise to become a virtuous citizen with 

a complete personality who would be a valuable asset to the country.

I would like to bestow my sincere thanks on the members of the editorial and writer 

boards as well as on the staff of the Educational Publications Department who have 

strived to offer this textbook to you.

Introduction

This  textbook  was  compiled  by  the  Educational  Publications  Department  in  accordance 
with the syllabus prepared by the National Institute of Education for the use of Grade 9 
students in the Sri Lankan school system with effect from 2018.

An  effort  has  made  here  to  arrange  the  subject  content  to  suit  the  national  educational 
goals, common national competencies, the objectives of teaching science and the content 
of the syllabus.

The subject of science directs the student towards a more active learning process in a manner 
as to develop knowledge, skills and attitudes needed for a developmental scientific thought.

In the compilation of this textbook, subject content is largely arranged based on experiences 
of daily life. It has contributed to prove the fact that the subject of science is very much 
closer to the day to day life.

The compilation of this textbook based on activities is a distinctive feature. The activities are 
prepared based on the scientific method in order to develop knowledge, skills and attitudes. 
Activities that can be performed individually at home as well as in school are incorporated 
here. We believe that learning through activities would contribute to create a liking and an 
interest in the child towards learning science. 

At the end of each chapter, a summary, a series of exercises and a glossary were included. It 
enables the student to identify the important details of the chapter as well as to self evaluate 
the achievement of learning outcomes.

For the purpose of directing the student to study further about the subject matter, more 
information is included in the "For extra knowledge". It is given only to broaden the subject 
area of the child and certainly not to ask questions at term tests.

Assignments  and  projects  are  given  with  the  purpose  of  directing  the  student  towards 
an  explorative  study.  It  enables  the  students  to  develop  the  higher  order  skills  such  as 
application, analysis and synthesis of the concepts achieved from the lesson.

We strongly believe that the duty of the teachers who teach science is to direct the student 
for self learning instead of teaching the student using traditional teaching methods. This 
textbook can be utilized by the teachers as a learning tool to execute their teaching role 
properly. 

We would like to bestow our sincere thanks on Chief project officer D. M. Wijesinghe and 
science teacher (Visakha Vidyalaya) S. M. Sanjeewa.

We kindly request you to forward your comments and suggestions on this textbook to the 
Educational Publications Department.

Applications of
Micro-organisms

1.1   Micro-organisms

Recall  what  you  have  learnt  about  micro-organisms  in  grade  8. You  have  learnt 
micro-organisms are unicellular or multicellular organisms which cannot be seen 
clearly with the naked eye. Do assignment 1.1 using the previous knowledge.

Assignment 1.1

 ² Prepare a list of the groups of micro-organisms you know and write names of 

micro-organisms belong to each group.  

Micro-organisms live in our environment as well as in our body.

Most micro-organisms are favourable to humans and other living beings, but some 
are harmful.

Micro-organisms  are  a  wide  spread  and  common  species  category  of  living 
organisms on Earth. They are a group of living organisms with a simple structure. 
They grow fast and have high rate of reproduction.

Micro-organisms have the ability to adapt for different environmental conditions 
and modes of nutrition.

Unicellular  and  some  of 
micro-organism category.

the  multicellular  organisms  can  be  seen 

in 

These micro-organisms can be categorized into groups as bacteria, fungi, algae and 
protozoa. Viruses which are a group in between the living and non-living are also 
studied under micro-organisms.

 ² No cellular organization
 ² They do not show the living 

characteristics such as 
respiration and growth 

 * Several enlarged diagrams of microbes are given in the above table. Memorization of the 

scientific names is not needed.

1.2     Environments and substrates of micro-organisms

Micro-organisms live within all the eco systems on the Earth where other living 
organisms survive. Microbial world spreads among soil, water and for about up to 
6 km of the atmosphere. These organisms survive even on and within the body of 
plants and animals. Meat, fish, fruits, vegetables, human skin, mouth, alimentary 
canal and urinary tract are some specific substrates that micro-organisms grow.

Microbes  can  survive  even  under  extreme  environmental  conditions.  Hot  water 
springs, salt marshes, liquids such as petrol and  diesel are some such environments.

1.3    Effects of micro-organisms
Micro-organisms have been used in different industries by human from the past. 
Micro-organisms are beneficial for the environmental equilibrium. But, they can 
also be harmful to human because some of them act as pathogens and spoil food.  

1.3.1    Beneficial effects of micro-organisms

Micro-organisms  are used  in  agriculture, medicine, conservation of  environment 
and  in  different  kinds  of  industries  in  seek  of  economical  advantages  and  for 
research purposes. Here we will investigate how they are being used in different 
fields.  

Applications of micro-organisms in agriculture

 ² Gene technology                 

In agriculture, crop harvest is enhanced and 
enriched  by  producing  drought-resistant 
and  pest-resistant  crops  and  crops  with 
high  nutrients  and  taste,  with  the  aid  of 
micro-organisms.  Further,  biological 
pesticides  and  weedicides  are  developed 
using micro-organisms.

Genes  of  the  bacterium  Erwinia  uredovora  is  used  in  developing  golden  rice 
enriched with vitamin A (figure 1.1).

Genes  of  the  bacterium  Bacillus  thuringiensis  is  muted  in  Zea  maize  genome  to 
produce toxins to crop pests.

 ² Nitrogen fixation

Even though 78% of Nitrogen exists naturally in the
atmosphere, plants have a limited ability to absorb it 
directly. But Rhizobium, a type of bacteria that lives 
in the nodules of legumes such as beans and  peas 
has  the  ability  to  absorb  atmospheric  Nitrogen 
directly. This process is known as Nitrogen fixation. 
Commercially  produced  Rhizobium  is  used  in 
cultivation  lands  in  order  to  increase  the  yield  of 
legumes.

Figure 1.2 - Nodules of legumes

Azotobacter, a free living Nitrogen fixing bacteria, is directly added to the cultivation 
lands.  They are known as bio fertilizers. Bio fertilizers are the substances which 
make the soil rich with nutrients by using micro-organisms.

 ² Producing compost                 

Compost is prepared by rapid decomposition of 
organic  matter  by  micro-organisms.  Compost 
adds  mineral  to  the  soil  systematically  and 
makes  favourable  conditions  for  plants  to 
grow. The organic matter in compost are often 
decomposed by bacteria and fungi.  

 ² Bio-pesticides
Some  of  the  micro-organisms  can  be  used  as 
bio pesticides to control insect pests that cause damage to the crops.

Figure 1.3 - Producing compost by using 
organic matter

e.g.  The fungus Alternaria is used to combat the aquatic weed, salvinia.

Applications of micro-organisms in medicine 

Use  of  micro-organisms  to  treat  the  diseases  caused  by  another  micro-organism 
is  very  common  in  medicine.  Micro-organisms  are  used  to  produce  antibiotics, 
vaccines and anti-toxins.  

 ² Producing antibiotics
Chemicals  produced  in  the  body  of  a
microbe  to  destroy  or  sabotage  another 
micro-organism are known as antibiotics.

Fungi  and  bacteria  are  used  to  produce 
antibiotics. Antibiotics can kill bacteria and 
fungi  but they do not fight against infections 
caused by viruses. 

Figure 1.4 - Some antibiotics

Although, antibiotics are not much harmful to human they can cause side effects if 
used without medical advice. 

Penicillin, Amoxicillin, Tetracycline and Erythromycin are used against bacterial 
infections while Griseofulvin is used against fungal infections.

For extra knowledge

 ² The antibiotic Penicillin was discovered by the Scottish 

scientist Alexander Fleming. 

 ² It is produced using the fungus Penicillium notatum. 

 ² Producing vaccines
A  vaccine  typically  contains  an  agent  that  resembles  a  disease  causing 
micro-organism; and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe 
or from its toxins.

 ² Vaccines made from weakened microbes
e.g. Polio, Tuberculosis, Measles

 ² Vaccines made from killed microbes
e.g. Cholera, Influenza, Typhoid

 ² Vaccines made from toxins of microbes

e.g. Tetanus, Diphtheria

 ² Vaccines made from body parts of microbes using genetic engineering 

e.g. Hepatitis B

Display the collected information in a wallpaper in the classroom. 

 ² Producing anti toxins

Bio-chemical substances produced by pathogenic bacteria which harm the host’s 
activity  are  known  as  toxins. Anti-toxins  are  synthesized  using  these  toxins  by 
removing its toxic components.
  e.g. Tetanus vaccine

Applications of micro-organisms in industries

Various  strains  of  microbes  are  used  for  research  and  economic  benefits.  Using 
micro-organisms  in  industrial  activities  for  economic  benefits  is  known  as 
Industrial Microbiology.

 ² Producing biogas
A  mixture  containing  organic  materials  such 
as  straw,  cow  dung  and  water  is  used  to 
produce  biogas.  Anaerobic  bacteria  such  as 
Methanococcus react on these organic surfaces 
and produce biogas. Biogas mainly consists of 
Methane gas. Therefore, it can be used as an 
energy source.

 ² Metal extraction
The most simple and effective technology used for the metal extraction from low 
grade ores, by the use of microbes, is known as bio-leaching. Uranium and Copper 
are such two metals that are extracted by bio-leaching.

When boiling, unfavourable bacteria in milk get 
destroyed.  Lactobacillus  and  Streptococcus  are 
used as culture in producing yoghurt. They turn  
Lactose into Lactic acid. Since it creates an acidic 
medium,  growth  of  other  micro-organisms  get 
retarded and enhance preservation. Refrigerating 
further retards bacterial growth.

 ² Products based on plant fibres

Plant fibres are used for various products and 
these  fibres  are  separated  by  using  bacteria. 
Coconut, hemp, palmyrah and agave plants are 
used to get fibre. The compound pectate which 
is among the fibres keep them bound together. 
The  Pectinase  enzyme  which  is  produced  by 
the  relevant  bacteria  helps  to  separate  these 
fibres by digesting pectate.

Applications of micro-organisms in environmental conservation

Micro-organisms  are  commonly  used  for  environmental  conservation.  The 
technology  used  to  remove  environmental  pollutants  using  micro-organisms  is 
known as bio-remediation.

Following are some instances where bio-remediation is applied.

 ² Microbes are used to decompose the organic waste matter in polluted water.
 ² Pseudomonas; a kind of a bacteria which is released on to the ocean water for 
the  decomposition  of  oil  layers  on  the  ocean. An  enzyme  released  by  these 
micro-organisms decomposes the hydrocarbons in oil.

 ² Heavy metals such as Chromium (Cr), Lead (Pb) and Mercury (Hg) are released 
to the environment from different industries. This polluted water is sent through 
a tower which contains bacteria to remove these toxic heavy metals from water.

We  have  discussed  the  favourable  impacts  of  micro-organisms.  Based  on  the 
following features, micro-organisms are used in economically important large-scale 
productions.

 ² Their biological processes occur very rapidly as their growth rate and metabolic 

rate is high.

 ² Various  strains/varieties  of  microbes  exist  that  are  capable  of  acting  and 

multiplying on various substances.

 ² Since  micro-organisms  possess  simple  genes,  they  can  be  easily  used  for 
genetic  engineering.  Hence,  microbes  are  often  used  for  modern  genetic 
engineering.

 ² The majority of micro-organisms can be obtained at very low rates or free of 

charge from the environment to use in industries.

 ² Though,  large  amount  of  energy  is  required  for  other  industries,  a  small 

amount of energy is required for industries using microbes.

 ² Though,  most  of  the  industries  cause  heavy  environmental  pollution  and 
serious  environmental  deterioration,  the  industries  with  microbes  cause 
minimal environmental damages.

1.3.2    Adverse effects of micro-organisms

Causing  diseases  for  man,  plants  and  animals  that  are  economically  important 
for man, food spoilage and economical damage to non-living surfaces are several 
adverse effects of microbes. Biological weapons are another instance where man 
uses microbes adversely.
Causing diseases

Bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa are the groups of micro-organisms that cause 
diseases. A  micro-organism  that  has  the  potential  to  cause  a  disease  is  called  a 
pathogen. Mosquitoes and flies are vectors which carry the pathogen to the host. 
Host is an organism, who provides its body inside or outside as the substrate to 
growth of the pathogen. 

e.g.   Viruses act as the pathogen for Dengue disease, while mosquitoes are the    

vectors. Symptoms appear on man, who is the host.

 ² Diseases caused by micro-organisms to human
Microbial  infections  spread  by  air,  water,  food,  contact,  vectors  etc.  Pathogenic 
micro-organisms  cause  different  infections  to  human  beings  through  various 
methods. Information of such infections is given in table 1.2.

For extra knowledge

Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by a protozoan. It is 
spread by the bite of Sandfly which acts as the vector. 
The protozoan can enter through skin ulcers. Then, it 
infects  the  skin,  mouth  and  nasal  path.  Skin  ulcers, 
fever, reducing red blood cells and enlarging liver are 
symptoms of leishmaniasis.

 ² Diseases caused by micro-organisms to plants
Some of the diseases caused by micro-organisms to plants are given below. 

Powdery mildew disease

Powdery mildew is a disease caused by a fungus. The leaves, stem, flowers and 
fruits of the plant are affected by this disease. Appearing of white or gray colour 
powdery material is the main symptom of infected parts. This disease can damage 
every part of the tree (figure 1.9).

Late blight 

Potato  plant  is  commonly  affected  by  this  disease  which  is  caused  by  a  fungus. 
Brown  spots  can  be  seen  on  the  leaves  and  later  they  turn  into  black. Then,  the 
whole tree gets affected by the disease (figure 1.10).

Wilting

Fungi  or  bacteria  cause  this  disease.  The  xylem  of  the  plants  which  transports 
water throughout the tree gets affected from this disease. Later the xylem does not 
function properly due to damage. Therefore, the whole plant gets withered due to 
poor supply of water (figure 1.11).

Food spoilage caused by micro-organisms 

1'11 rEmh 

Micro-organisms multiply on food as food has the necessary factors for the growth 
of  micro-organisms.  Micro-organisms  convert  the  components  of  the  food  into 
unfavourable materials or they add toxic materials to food. Due to this reason the 
nature of the food is changed. The change of physical and chemical nature of food 
makes the food unfit for consumption. This process is known as food spoilage. 

(You  have  learnt  about  food  spoilage  such  as  fermentation  of  carbohydrates, 
putrefaction of proteins and rancidity of lipids in grade 8).

18

Science | Eye and Ear 

 
Let us see how the eye perceives visionary senses.

Let us inquire the way that our eye functions to give us sight. To see an object clearly, 
light rays must be entered to the eye from the object. The rays refract through the 
lens  and  converge  on  to  the  retina,  forming  an  inverted  image.  Then,  the  nerve 
endings on the retina get stimulated and send the message about the image to the 
brain through optic nerve. Optical area of brain interpret it as an upright image.  

Eye lens is convex. Let us engage in the activity 2.2 to study the refraction of light 
through convex and concave lenses.

Activity 2.2

You will need :-   A convex lens, a concave lens, a parallel beam of light made 
by using a torch or by reflecting the sunlight using a mirror, a 
comb 

Method :-
 ² Let the parallel beam of light fall on the convex lens and observe the refracted 

rays.

 ² Let the parallel beam of light fall on the concave lens and observe the refracted 

rays.

 ² Draw the path of the light in both situations in your note book.

The path of a parallel beam of light directed towards a convex lens after refracting 
through  the  lens  is  depicted  in  the  figure  2.5. After  refraction  the  light  rays  get 
converged to a point. 

Focus

Figure 2.5 - Refraction of parallel beam of light through convex lens

Focal length

The point that collects light rays in front of a convex lens is called the focal point 
of the lens. The distance between lens and focus is focal length.

Science | Eye and Ear  19

A parallel beam of light falls on a concave lens after refraction through the lens get 
diverged as in the figure 2.6.

Focal length

Focus

Figure 2.6 - Refraction of parallel beam of light through concave lens

After  the  refraction,  the  light  rays  can  be  observed  to  be  diverged,  as  shown  in 
figure 2.6. Here the rays after refraction appear to come from a point called focus.

An image of an close object forms far from the convex lens, while far object forms 
an image, close to the lens. Let us engage in activity 2.3 to study this concept.

Activity 2.3

You will need :-   A convex lens, a candle, a box of matches, lens holder, a screen 
(you can prepare a  screen by covering a lens holder or a small 
box with a white paper)

Method :-

 ² Fix the convex lens to the lens holder. Using the lens get a clear image of a 

distant object on the screen.

 ² Light the candle in front of the lens and get a clear image on the screen. 
 ² Measure the distance between the lens and the image ( image distance) in both 

cases, and compare.

You can confirm that the image distance is more when the object is located close by 
than it is located far away.

But, considering the eye, the distance from the lens to the retina (image distance) 
cannot  be  changed.  Then,  how  can  we  clearly  see  the  objects  close  by  and  far 
away? The lens of the eye has the ability to increase or decrease its curvature to the 
required size. 

Let us do the activity 2.4 to study about the image formation of a distant object and 
nearby object without changing the image distance.

20

Science | Eye and Ear 

Activity 2.4 

 You will need :-   A convex lens with a less curvature, another convex lens with 

a higher curvature, candle, lens holder, screen

Method-
 ² Fix the convex lens with less 
curvature  to  the  lens  holder

distant object on to the screen 
(figure 2.7 a).

 ² Fix  the  convex  lens  with  a 
higher  curvature  to  the  lens 
holder  without  changing  the 
distance between the lens and 
the  screen.  Now  get  a  clear 
image  of  the  lit  candle  on  to 
the screen (figure 2.7 b).

Figure 2.7 a

Figure 2.7 b

The focal length is comparatively 
high in low-convex lenses (lens 
with a less curvature) while the 
focal  length  is  relatively  low 
in  higher  convex  lenses  (lenses 
with a higher curvature).  

Figure 2.8 a - Convex 
lens with less curvature

with high curvature

Figure 2.8

According to the activity 2.4 it can be concluded as follows. 
To get a clear image without changing the image distance,

 ² The curvature of the eye lens should be reduced for a distant object. 
 ² The curvature of the eye lens should be increased for a close object. 

Assignment 2.1 

Make a water lens using necessary items.

By increasing or decreasing the curvature of the lens, get clear images of a lit 
candle placed in different places, without changing the image distance.

The rays that reach from the far object, can be considered as parallel rays.

Figure 2.9

The rays that reach the eye from the far object, get refracted through the lens and 
converged onto the retina making an image on it.

The rays that reach the eye from the close object, get refracted through the lens and 
converged onto the retina making an image on it.

2.2    Defects of vision

Two eye defects can be identified in vision, when the eye ball becomes short or long 
and when eye is unable to adjust the focal length of its lens to the desired level.

 ² Long sight (hypermetropia)
 ² Short sight (myopia)

22

Science | Eye and Ear 

Long sight (hypermetropia)

A person having this defect is able to see far objects clearly, but close objects 
become unclear. This happens because of the inability to increase the curvature of 
the eye lens  or the eye ball being too short. This defect can be corrected by using 
a convex lens.

Let us look at how the vision of a person suffering from long sight takes place.

 ² The  person  can  focus  the  rays 
coming from a distant object on the 
retina to form a sharp image. So, that 
he  can  see  distant  objects  clearly 
(figure 2.11).

 ² The light rays from the nearby 
object  cannot  be  brought  to 
focus  on  the  retina  to  give  a 
distinct  image.  In  this  case  the 
image  is  formed  behind  the 
retina,  as  the  rays  get  focused 
behind the retina (figure 2.12).

Figure 2.11

Figure 2.12

Correcting the long sight
 ² This  defect  can  be  corrected  by  using  a  convex  meniscus  lens.  The  convex 
meniscus lens receives the light rays and converge them. The eye lens converges 
the rays again to focus the image at the retina.

Figure 2.13 - Long sight and its correction

Let us do the activity 2.5 to understand what happens after long sight is corrected.

Science | Eye and Ear  23

You will need :- Two convex lenses, a candle, a screen

Method :-

²  Using one convex lens

distant object on the 
screen.

 ² Get  a  clear  image  of  a 
somewhat  far  object  on 
the screen.

From the activity 2.5 you can understand that, when nearby objects cannot be seen 
clearly, convex lenses can be used to make the image clear.

Science | Eye and Ear 

Short sight (myopia)

A person sees nearby objects clearly while distant objects appear blurred. This 
defect arises because of the inability to reduce the curvature of the eye lens or due 
to the elongation of the eye ball. This defect can be corrected by using a concave 
lens.

Let us look at how the vision of a person suffering from short sight takes place.

 ² The  rays  coming  from  close  objects 
can  be  focused  on  the  retina.  So, 
the  close  objects  can  be  seen  clearly 
(figure 2.15).    

 ² The  rays  coming  from  distant  objects 
are  focused  in  front  of  the  retina.  So, 
the image of a distant object is formed 
in front of the retina and cannot be seen 
clearly (figure 2.16). 

Figure 2.15

Figure 2.16

Correcting the short sight
 ² This defect can be corrected by using concave meniscus lenses. The rays from 
the  object  are  diverged  through  the  concave  meniscus  lens  and  the  eye  lens 
converge them to a point on retina to make the image clear.

Figure 2.17 -  Short sight and its correction

Let  us  do  the  activity  2.6  to  understand  what  happens  after  correcting  the  short 
sight.

Activity  2.6

You will need :- A convex lens, a concave lens, candle, screen

Method :-

 ² Light the candle in front 
of  the  convex  lens  and 
get  a  clear  image  of  it 
on the screen.

Figure 2.18  a

d

 ² When the candle is kept far away without changing the distance between 
the  lens  and  the  screen  (distance  “d”),  we  can  get  a  blurred  image  of  a 
distant object on the screen. 

Figure 2.18  b

 ² Place a concave lens in front of the convex lens and move it till a clear 

image of the candle is formed on the screen.

Figure 2.18 c

From the activity 2.6 it can be understood that when distant objects cannot be seen 
clearly, concave lenses can be used to get a clear image of a distant object.

Binocular vision and stereoscopic vision  

The  eyes  of  human,  monkey,  'Rilava'/'Mandi',  chimpanzee,  gorilla  and  loris  are 
located in front position of the skull (figure 2.19). So, there is a greater chance of 
seeing the same area with both eyes.

The ability to maintain visual focus on an object with both eyes creating a single 
visual image, is known as binocular vision. The human has a broader range of a 
binocular vision.

Science | Eye and Ear  27

Let us do the activity 2.7 to identify your range of binocular vision.

Activity 2.7

Method :-
 ² Keep the face straight and look forward.
 ² Do the following things without moving the face.
 ² Stretch your hands and fold your fingers.
 ² Straighten the thumb right upwards.
 ² Close your left eye and move your left hand in the horizontal plane to the left 

until you cannot see the thumb.

 ² Keep the left hand in the same position and close your right eye. Now move 
your right hand in the horizontal plane to your right until you can’t see the 
thumb.

 ² Now look at both thumbs using the both eyes.

Your eyes can see the objects which lie in the range of the stretched hands. It is your 
binocular range. But, when both eyes are open, the objects seen to the left of the left 
hand can be seen only by the left eye. Similarly the objects to the right of the right 
hand can be seen only by the right eye.

Due to the binocular vision human has got the stereoscopic vision and the ability 
to determine the distance of an object. stereoscopic vision means the ability of eye 
to determine the depth of an object or the height of it. Let us do the activity 2.8 to 
study this further.

Activity 2.8

You will need :- A ball point pen 

Method :-
 ² Hold  the  clip  of  the  pen  keeping  its  hole  upwards  in  a  distance  when  you 

stretch the hands to your front.

 ² Close one eye and insert the pen into the clip.
 ²
Insert the pen again into the clip using both eyes.
 ² Compare the difference of ease, in both situations.

It is easier to insert the pen into the clip by seeing through both eyes rather than 
seeing through one eye. This is because of the stereoscopic vision of the eye.

2.3    Eye diseases

Two common eye diseases identified at present are;  

 ² Cataract

 ² Glaucoma

Cataract 

A cataract is a cloudiness or opacity in normally transparent crystalline lens of the 

eye. It happens because of the denaturing of proteins in the eye lens. Then, eye lens 

turns in to milky colour.

The lens of a healthy eye is transparent

The lens of a diseased eye is not transparent

Figure 2.22 

Cataract prevents the light rays coming from an object focusing properly on the 

retina. Then, all the objects are seen blurred.

Generally, cataract may occur with age and genetic factors. It is believed that ultra 
violet  rays  reach  the  Earth  through  holes  of  the  ozone  layer  affect  towards  the 
occurrence of cataracts in eye.

Glaucoma

Glaucoma is a disease that gradually reduces the visual range of the eye and leads 
to blindness due to the damage of the optic nerve. By detecting at the first stage 
further increase of glaucoma can be controlled. Glaucoma is usually the result of 
high  blood pressure inside the eye. A person with diabetes has an increased risk of 
developing glaucoma. The damage caused to the eye from this disease cannot be 
reversed again.

 ² Directs sound waves towards the auditory canal
 ² Directs the sound to tympanic membrane
 ² Vibrates in response to the sound wave and acquires 
    the auditory senses
 ² Three bones named malleus, incus and stapes
 ² Transmit sound related vibration to the cochlea
 ² An open tube connected to pharynx
 ² Controls  the pressure on either sides of the tympanic 
    membrane
 ² The nerve endings of the auditory nerve is connected 

to cochlea

 ² Transmit auditory senses to the auditory nerve
 ² Take auditory senses to the relevant part of the 
    brain
 ² That sound is interpreted by the relevant part of the 
    brain
 ² Contribute to maintain the balance of body

Let us see how the ear perceives auditory senses.  

Do  the  activity  2.10  to  demonstrate  how  a  membrane  is  vibrated  according  to  a 

sound.

Activity 2.10

a tuning folk

Method :-

You will need :- Two funnels, sheath of a balloon, 2m length rubber tube, a thread, 

 ² Tighten well the balloon sheath to the mouth of a funnel.

 ² Join the two funnels to the open ends of the 2m length rubber tube.

 ² Keep the funnel with the balloon sheath to one of the student's ear and vibrate 

the tuning folk near the other funnel.

 ² Report your observations.

Figure 2.29

When  the  folk  is  vibrated  the  rubber  sheath  too  vibrates  and  the  sound  is  better 

heard. Similarly, correspond to the sound wave the tympanic membrane vibrates.

The sound waves created by the vibrations of the objects in the external environment, 

travels  to  tympanic  membrane  along  the  external  auditory  canal.  The  tympanic 

membrane is vibrated accordingly. The vibrations are then transmitted to cochlea 

through ossicles. The nerve endings connected to cochlea take the auditory senses 

to the auditory nerve. The auditory nerve transmits the impulse to the relevant part 

of the brain. The sound is interpreted by the auditory area of the brain. 

2.5   Defects of ear

Disorders such as impaired hearing, deafness, hardening of ossicles may occur in 

ears while living or from the birth. It is also said that people who are deaf from birth 

are dumb too. Hearing aids can be used as a remedy for loss of hearing.

You know that 20 Hz - 20 000 Hz is the audible range of the human ear. There 

is also a limited intensity of sound in this range that the ear can tolerate. Sounds 

beyond that range can damage the ear.

Necessary precautions should be taken to protect
the ear.
 ² Avoid inserting foreign objects into the ear
 ² Refrain exposing to loud noises
 ² Do  not  put  any  medicines  for  the  ear  without 

medical advice

 ² Avoid  diving  in  deep  waters  without  wearing 
safety equipment (As pressure is very high in deep 
water)

 ² Avoid slapping on the ear and dragging by the ear lobe

Summary

 ² Optical sensory organ of the body is the eye.
 ²

Images that are real, inverted and smaller than the object formed on the retina 
are interpreted by the brain. This is known as vision.

 ² Binocular vision of human is important to determine the distance of an object 

and stereoscopic vision.

 ² The most common defects of vision are long sight and short sight.
 ² Long sight can be corrected by using a convex lens while short sight can be 

corrected by using a concave lens.

 ² Most frequent eye diseases at present are cataract and glaucoma.
 ² To maintain a healthy vision for a long period of  time, necessary precautions 

should be taken to protect the eye.

 ² Audio sensory organ of the body is the ear.
 ² Sound waves vibrate the tympanic membrane and the cochlea in the ear. This 

results the stimulation of the nerve endings at the cochlea.

 ² This  auditory  impulse  is  carried  to  the  brain  by  the  auditory  nerve  and  the 

relevant part of the brain interpret the sound. This is known as hearing.
 ² The semi-circular canals contribute to maintain the balance of the body.
 ² Hardening of ossicles, impaired hearing and deafness are some disorders of 

hearing.

 ² The range of audibility of the human ear is between 20 Hz - 20 000 Hz.
 ² The sounds of higher intensities may damage the ear.
 ² Necessary precautions must be followed to protect the ear.

Nature and 
Properties of Matter

Recall  what  you  have  learnt  about  the  properties  of  matter  in  grade  8. You  may 
call back to your mind how matter was classified as pure substances and non-pure 
substances (mixtures). Based on that knowledge engage in the activity 3.1. 

Activity 3.1

Classify and tabulate the substances given below as pure substances and mixtures. 

air,  drinking  water,  aluminium,  silver,  copper,  salt  solution,  distilled  water, 
carbon, sulphur, zinc, copper sulphate, sodium chloride 

Matter that contain  only  one  constituent with  specific  properties are  called  pure 
substances. Accordingly, aluminium, silver, copper, distilled water, carbon, sulphur, 
zinc, copper sulphate and sodium chloride belong to the class of pure substances. 

Matter that contain two or more constituents are known as mixtures. Hence, air, 
drinking water and salt solution can be named as mixtures. 

In grade 8 you have learnt that pure substances can be further classified as elements 
and compounds. To strengthen that knowledge further, involve in the activity 3.2. 

Activity 3.2 

Classify and tabulate the following pure substances as elements and compounds. 
sulphur, glucose, chlorine, sodium chloride, silver, copper, copper sulphate, zinc 

The pure substances with specific properties which, cannot be further divided by 
either physical or chemical methods into substances with different properties, are 
called elements. Accordingly iron, sulphur, chlorine, silver, zinc and copper belong 
to elements. There are about 120 elements have been discovered  upto now.

Very often, English name of the element is used as the base for these symbols. In 

such case the first letter of the name of the element is used as the symbol. When a 

single letter is used as the symbol, compulsorily it should be a capital letter. Table

3.1.2   Building units of elements 

You have learnt that, matter is composed of particles. These 
particles cannot be observed by the naked eye or even by 
the  powerful  microscopes.  These  very  small  particles  are 
called atoms. 

John Dalton (1766 - 1844) was the first scientist to use the 
term atom for the smallest, indivisible particle from which 
the matter is made. The English name 'atom' for this particle 
has  originated  from  the  Greek  word  'atomos'  meaning, 
"cannot be divided further."

Figure 3.3 - John Dalton

An element is composed of the atoms of the same type. The atoms which, form 
different elements are different to each other. For example, the element iron is formed 
from iron atoms. Aluminium is formed from aluminium atoms. The structures of 
aluminium atoms and iron atoms differ from each other. 

The units formed by the combination of one or more atoms of the same type or one 
or more atoms of different types are called molecules.  

Under normal conditions, the element oxygen exists as oxygen molecules composed 
of two oxygen atoms. The smallest form in which oxygen can exist independently 
is a molecule. Some examples for the elements which can exist as molecules are 
given in table 3.5.

Since the above molecules are formed by the atoms of the same elements they are 
known as  homo-atomic molecules. 

Therefore,  elements  are  composed  either,  from  atoms  of  the  same  kind  or  from 
molecules formed by combining those same kind of atoms. Thus, they cannot be 
further divided into simple substances chemically.

Atomic number (Z)

The  number  of  protons  present  in  the  nucleus  of  a  given  atom  of  an  element  is 
called the atomic number. It is generally designated by the symbol Z. The atomic 
number or the number of protons in the nucleus is a unique property of the element. 
As an atom is electrically neutral, number of protons and number of electrons are 
equal. The atomic numbers of some elements are given in table 3.7.

The sum of the protons and neutrons present in the nucleus of a given atom of an 
element, is called the mass number of the atom of that element. The mass number 
is represented by the symbol A.

atom. This standard method is, writing atomic number at the left hand side bottom 
end and mass number at the left hand side top end of the symbol of the atom. The 
information related to an atom of element sodium (Na) is given below.

3.2    Compounds

Compounds  are  formed  by  the  chemical  combination  of  two  or  more  elements 
in  a  certain  ratio.  Some  of  those  compounds  exist  in  nature  as  molecules.  Since 
those molecules contain atoms that are different from one another, they are called 
hetero-atomic molecules.

e.g.   A Hydrogen chloride molecule is formed by the combination of  

one hydrogen atom and one chlorine atom.

Cl

H Cl

Thus, a main difference between elements and compounds 
is that an element is composed of the atoms of the same 
kind while a compound is formed from atoms belonging 
to two or more kinds of elements. 

e.g.  A water molecule is formed by the  

combination of an oxygen atom and two  
 hydrogen atoms. This is illustrated by figure 3.9.

also. These symbols are known as chemical formula of 
compounds. You will study them in higher grades.

3.3    Mixtures 

Next, let us study about the non-pure substances (mixtures). 

Pay your attention to sea water. Various salts and various gases are dissolved in it. 
That means, it contains several constituents. Therefore, sea water is a mixture. In 
natural environment mostly we come across mixtures and not pure substances. Air, 
soil, river water and rocks around us are all mixtures. Yoghurt, ice cream and fruit 
salad we eat are also mixtures. The drinks such as tea, coffee and soft drinks too 
are mixtures.

Fruit salad

Coffee

Figure 3.13 - Some mixtures

Ice cream

Mixtures  are  formed  when  two  or  more  pure  substances  get  mixed.  The  pure 
substances in a mixture are called as constituents. 

Let us identify constituents in some mixtures. Let us study table 3.10. 

Table 3.10 - Mixtures and their constituents

Crude oil

diesel, petrol, kerosene, tar

The  specific  feature  of  a  mixture  is  that,  its  constituents  can  be  separated  by 
physical methods. When rice is mixed with sand they can be separated by sifting 
using the sifting bowl. So, sifting is a physical method of separating constituents 
in a mixture. Let us involve in activity 3.3 to study about the physical methods of 
separating constituents in a mixture.

According to that, mixtures can be described as follows. 

A matter which consists of two or more constituents which can be separated by 
physical methods are called mixtures.

According to the nature, mixtures can be divided into two categories.

1.  Homogeneous mixtures

2.  Heterogeneous mixtures

Homogeneous mixtures

Let us involve in activity 3.4 to study about homogeneous mixtures. 

Activity 3.4

1.  Weigh about 2 g of salt, add it to a beaker containing 500 ml of water, mix 

well with a glass rod and allow to stand for a few minutes.

2.  Observe carefully.

You  will  be  able  to  see  that  properties  like  colour  and  transparency  are  alike 
throughout the mixture. The mixtures with a uniform composition right throughout 
the mixture are called homogeneous mixtures. 

e.g. 

Salt solution, sugar solution, sea water

Heterogeneous mixtures
Dissolve a little clay in water, allows to stand from some time and observe. If you 
observe carefully you may be able to see that the colour and transparency of the 
mixture is different from place to place.  

The mixtures in which the composition is not uniform throughout the mixture are 
known as heterogeneous mixtures. 

e.g.   Muddy water, mortar mixture, ice cream, fruit salad

Assignment 3.3

 ² Prepare mixtures by mixing each of the following with small amount of water 

and observe these mixtures. 

      salt, soap, copper sulphate, limestone, washing blue, chilli powder
 ² Record the observations
 ² Classify the mixtures you have prepared as homogeneous and heterogeneous.

Basic Concepts 
Associated with Force

4

4.1   Force

Let us consider situations like lifting an object, pushing a table, opening or closing 
a door or hitting a ball  (figure 4.1).

Figure 4.1
In such instances what we do is, pulling or pushing the object. Such a pulling or 
pushing is called a force, simply a force means a pull or a push. 

When we push a book on the table, it moves. A ball moves faster if we kick it. But, 
you can not push and move a wall. A single person cannot push and move a bus or 
a lorry. Thus, it is clear that, sometimes we can move an object by applying a force 
and sometimes a force cannot result any motion. 

When you catch a ball that comes towards you, a force is applied to stop it. When 
you hit a ball with a bat, you apply a force to change the direction and the speed of 
the ball. 

You can press a ball by keeping it on the ground and tread on it. Here, you change 
the shape of the ball by applying a force.

Accordingly, by applying a force;

object at rest can be moved.

object in motion can be stopped.

the speed of motion can be changed.

the direction of motion can be changed.

the shape of object can be changed.

Science | Basic Concepts Associated with Force

4.2     Magnitude of force

A ball can be moved slowly by hitting slightly. If you hit it harder it moves fast. 

When  hitting  slowly,  it  applies  a  small  force.  Hitting  fast,  applies  a  large  force. 

Thus, it is clear that the force has a magnitude. 

There are several equipment that can be used to measure the magnitude of a force. 

Spring  balance  is  a  simple  equipment  used  for  this  purpose. What  is  inside  of  a 

spring balance is a spring, that changes its length according to the force applied. It 

is calibrated according to the stretched length of the spring. 

There  are  several  units  to  measure  the  magnitude  of  a  force.  According  to  the 

international system (SI) of units, magnitude of force is measured in Newtons (N). 

There are spring balances in school laboratories, which are calibrated in Newtons. 

But, spring balances which are used for commercial purposes are usually calibrated 

in grams (g) or kilograms (kg).

Do the activity 4.1 to understand how a spring balance can be used to measure a force.

Activity 4.1

You will need :-  A Newton spring balance, a piece of stone, a wooden 

block, a helical spring, a piece of thread, a metal hook, 

a G-Clamp

Method :- 

 ² Tie the stone by a piece of thread.

 ² Hang the stone on the spring balance as shown in figure 4.2, and

You will need :- A wooden block, few tintex nails, some thread

Method :- 
 ² Fix a nail at the mid point on one side of the 
wooden block. Tie a piece of thread to the nail 
(figure  4.7),  so  that  the  thread  is  leaning  on 
the block.

 ² Place  the  wooden  block  on  the  table  as  in  figure  4.7  (a),  and  pull  it  by  the 
thread, keeping the thread horizontally. Observe the direction of motion of the 
wooden block.

 ² Then, change the direction of the thread to a side, while keeping it horizontally 
as in figure 4.7 (b) and draw. Observe the direction of motion of the wooden 
block.

You  can  observe  that  the  wooden  block  moves  in  the  direction  of  pull  as  in  the 
figure 4.7 (a) of the above activity. When the direction of pulling is changed as in 
figure 4.7 (b), the direction of motion of the wooden block changes as shown in 
figure 4.7 (c).

Thus, it can be concluded as follows.
 ² The force acts to the direction of pulling, along the thread.
 ² The object moves along the direction of force exerted. 

Activity 4.3 

You will need:-   A wooden block, a circular wooden disc, few tintex nails, some 

thread

Method :-
 ² Fix tintex nails to the points A, B and C on the upper 
surface of the wooden block as shown in figure 4.8.
 ² Fix a nail to the center of the wooden disc as shown in

Moreover the length of the straight line drawn to denote the force of 10 N on X 
should be twice as long as the one drawn to denote the force of 5 N on Y. 

In our day-to-day life, we apply forces on various objects. When we write with a 
pen, we have to apply forces to move the pen on the sheet of paper. When walking, 
forces are applied on the floor by our feet. When playing cricket, forces are applied 
on the ball by hitting the bat. To move the bat, the player has to apply force on the 
bat.

(a)

Figure 4.11

(b)

We have to make an effort to do these types of work. Most of the time, we apply 
forces in the easiest way to reduce effort. For example, let us consider the figure 
4.11 (a). A person drawing a loaded cart is shown there. He applies a horizontal 
force, because the cart should be moved horizontally. But, the person has to bend 
and pull with a difficulty to maintain the horizontal force. This difficulty can easily 
be overcome by drawing the cart to a direction shown in figure 4.11 (b). Although 
the force is not applied horizontally, the cart moves to the direction we want. What 
we do here is changing the direction of force to make the work easy.

(a)

Figure 4.12

(b)

A person pushing a loaded cart is shown in the figure 4.12 (a). The person has to 
bend and push it with difficulty. To ease the work, a wooden or metal handle can be 
fitted to the cart and the point where the force is applied (point of application) can 
be changed (figure 4.12 (b)).

In our day-to-day life, we select the way of applying forces in such a way, that the 
work is handled easier. What is applied here is not merely the scientific knowledge, 
but our practical experiences also contribute a lot. But, if there is some knowledge 
about forces, our tasks can be fulfilled easier.

5.1   Pressure

You may have experienced that, when the strap of your school bag is narrow, it is 
uncomfortable to the shoulder. When it is broad it is not that uncomfortable. 

(a) A child bearing a bag with a 
narrow strap uncomfortably

(b) A child bearing a bag with a 
broad strap easily

Figure 5.1

There are two school bags of equal weight. The shoulder strap of one of them is 
narrow and that of the other one is broad. Though, the strap is narrow or broad, the 
force exerted by the weight of school bag is the same. But, when the strap of it is 
narrow, the contact area is less, and when it is broad that area is more.

Thus it is clear that, though the force is the same, the pressure against the shoulder 
differs with the area of contact of the strap.

Consider two bags having the straps of the same breadth and different weights of 
books. The bag with more weight gives more press against the shoulder.

(b) A child bearing a heavy bag

Figure 5.2

60 Science | Pressure Exerted  by Solid

The force exerted by the weight of the school bag, is distributed through out the 

area of contact. It is the distributed force, that is felt by the shoulder. 

When the strap of the bag is broad, the force is distributed over a large area. Hence, 

the pressure felt by the shoulder is less. In these instances, it is useful to know the 

force exerted over a unit area. 

The force exerted over a unit area is known as the pressure.

5.2      Factors affecting the pressure

Let us do activity 5.1 to study the factors affecting the pressure.

Activity 5.1

You will need :-   several  cakes  of  soap,  thin  metal  wire,  several  bags  of  sand 

with the weight of 10 N each, a piece of plank which is longer 

than the length of the cake of soap and similar in breadth of the 

same, a stop watch

Method :- 

 ² Place the cake of soap on 

the  plank  which  is  kept 

on two tables as shown in 

the figure 5.3.

 ² Hang one sand bag on the 

wire which is sent round 

the cake of soap. Observe 

what happens.

In the activity 5.1, sometimes one sand bag will not be enough for the wire to cut 

through the cake of soap. If it is so, the reason is that the force exerted by the weight 

of one sand bag is not enough to cut the cake of soap. When the number of sand 

bags are being increased, time taken for the wire to cut through the cake of soap 

becomes less.  

 
The force exerted by the weight of the school bag, is distributed through out the 
area of contact. It is the distributed force, that is felt by the shoulder. 
When the strap of the bag is broad, the force is distributed over a large area. Hence, 
the pressure felt by the shoulder is less. In these instances, it is useful to know the 
force exerted over a unit area. 

The force exerted over a unit area is known as the pressure.

5.2      Factors affecting the pressure

Let us do activity 5.1 to study the factors affecting the pressure.

Activity 5.1

You will need :-   several  cakes  of  soap,  thin  metal  wire,  several  bags  of  sand 
with the weight of 10 N each, a piece of plank which is longer

In the activity 5.1, sometimes one sand bag will not be enough for the wire to cut 
through the cake of soap. If it is so, the reason is that the force exerted by the weight

Two facts are revealed by this activity. They are;

 ▪ Force affects the pressure exerted on a solid object.
 ▪ Pressure increases with the increase of force.

These facts are confirmed by the activity 5.2.

Activity 5.2

You will need :- 
a piece of plank with the size of 15 cm × 10 cm × 1 cm, 
a piece of plank with the size of  20 cm × 15 cm × 1 cm,

a piece of sponge with the size of 15 cm × 10 cm × 5 cm, 
four 1” nails, a ruler of 15cm or a scale, weight of 2 kg, 
weight of 5 kg, a hammer, a Newton spring balance

In every instance of the above activity, the area of the wooden block, in contact 
with the piece of sponge is the same. The force exerted on the piece of sponge is 
increased gradually. Accordingly, the contraction of the sponge is also increased. 
Thus,  it  is  clear  that  the  pressure  on  the  piece  of  sponge  is  increased  gradually. 
Therefore, it can be concluded that the pressure increases with the increase of force.

Activity 5.3

You will need :- a cake of soap, a piece of thin wire with the diameter of 0.2 mm, 
a piece of thick wire with the diameter of 1.5 mm, a sand bag 
of  the  weight  of  20N,  a  piece  of  plank  which  is  similar  in 
breadth to the cake of soap

Method :- 
 ² Place  the  piece  of  plank 
between  two  table-tops 
and keep the cake of soap 
on the plank as shown in 
the figure 5.5.

Science | Pressure Exerted  by Solid

63

In the activity 5.3 above, same weight is used in both instances; with the thick wire 
as well as with the thin wire. Hence, the force exerted on the cake of soap is same 
in both instances. But, the cake of soap is cut through easily when the thin wire is 
used. The reason for this is that, the force acted on unit area of the cake of soap is 
greater when the thin wire is used. That means, the pressure is greater when thin 
wire is used, than when the thick wire is used. Cutting through the cake of soap is 
easier when more pressure is exerted.

The manner the pressure changes according to the area on which force is acted, can 
be understood further by doing the activity 5.4.

Activity 5.4

You will need :- 
a piece of plank with the size of 15 cm × 10 cm × 1 cm, 
a piece of plank with the size of 20 cm × 15 cm × 1 cm,
a wooden block (A) with the size of 15 cm × 10 cm × 5 cm,
a piece of sponge (B) with the size of 15 cm × 10 cm × 5 cm,
a piece of sponge (C) with the size of 15 cm × 5 cm × 5 cm,

 ² What is the conclusion that can be made according to the observations?

During this activity, same wooden block is kept on all sponges. Therefore, the force 
exerted on all different sponges is the same. But, the contact area of the wooden 
block on each piece of sponge is changed. 

Science | Pressure Exerted  by Solid

65

When the contact area is large, the contraction of the sponge is less and when that 
area is less, the contraction of sponge is higher. 

The standard unit of measuring pressure is N m-2. It is also known as Pascal (Pa). 

In honour of the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, unit of pressure was named 

Therefore,  it  is  clear  that  the  pressure  is  less,  when  the  contact  area  is  high  and 
vice-versa. 

Accordingly, it can be concluded as follows. 

 ² The pressure exerted by a solid object on a solid surface depends on the surface 

area on which the force is acting.

 ² Higher the surface area on which the force is acting, pressure become low.
 ² Lower the surface area on which the force is acting, pressure become high.

According to the above activities it is confirmed that the pressure exerted by a solid 
object on a solid surface depends on two factors. They are; 

1.  Perpendicular force acting on the surface

2.  Surface area on which the force is acting

Pressure  is  defined  as  the  perpendicular  force  acting  normally  on  an  unit  area. 
Pressure exerted by  a solid object on a solid surface can be calculated according to 
the following formula.

Pressure (P) =

Perpendicular force (F)
Surface area on which the force is acting (A)

5.3    Units of pressure

Units of pressure can be deduced by using the above relationship of pressure. The 
standard unit of measuring force is N (Newton) and the standard unit of measuring 
surface area is m2 (square metre).

When cutting something it is easier if the knife is  well 

sharpened. When sharpening, the knife-edge becomes 

very thin. It can exert a high pressure on the object. So, 

the object can be cut thinner and easier (figure 5.7).

When cutting something it is easier if the knife is  well 
sharpened. When sharpening, the knife-edge becomes 
very thin. It can exert a high pressure on the object. So, 
the object can be cut thinner and easier (figure 5.7).

The bottom of the skates used by skiers is made 
sharp  like  a  knife-edge  (figure  5.8).  Because  of 
this, a high pressure is exerted on ice, when the 
skier is skating. That high pressure makes the ice 
liquify and form a slippery surface.

Roads  can  be  easily  damaged  because  of  the 
high  pressure  exerted  by  heavily  loaded  trucks 
and  container  carriers.  To  avoid  this,  such 
vehicles are made with a large number of wheels 
(figure  5.9).  Then,  the  contact  area  with  the 
road is increased and the pressure is decreased. 
Hence, the damages to the roads are minimized.

Assignment 5.1

In our day-to-day activities, we have to increase or decrease pressure. One way 
of doing this is the change of surface area. List such instances and explain them 
scientifically. 

Summary  

 ² Pressure is defined as the perpendicular force acting on an unit area.
 ² The  pressure  exerted  by  a  solid  object  on  a  solid  surface  depends  on  two 

factors. They are,

•  Perpendicular force acting on the surface
•  Surface area on which the force is acting 

 ²

Pressure (P) =

 Perpendicular force (F)
 Surface area (A)

 ² The unit of measuring pressure is N m-2 / N/m2 or Pascal (Pa).
 ² Pressure  can  be  increased  or  decreased  by  manipulating  the  factors  which 

affect on pressure.

6.3    Components of blood and their functions

Although  you  see  blood  as  a  red  fluid,  only  55%  of  its  value  is  in  liquid  form. 
This liquid part is called as the plasma. The other  45% of its volume consists of 
corpuscles which is in solid form.

A microscopic observation of a blood sample shows three types of corpuscles.

 y Red blood cells/ erythrocytes
 y White blood cells/ leukocytes
 y Platelets 

Erythrocytes and leukocytes are cells while the platelets are cell fragments.

Functions of blood

Red blood cells/ erythrocytes 

Red blood cells contain a red pigment which is called haemoglobin. Haemoglobin 
carries oxygen from lungs to the body cells and also gives blood its red colour.  

White blood cells/ leukocytes

White  blood  cells  defend  the  body  by  destroying  pathogens  and  producing 
antibodies.  White  blood  cells  are  categorized  into  neutrophils,  eosinophils, 
basophils, lymphocytes and monocytes.

Platelets

Platelets help in the clotting process of blood at a bleeding site. Some virus infections 
cause a rapid decline in a platelet percentage. e.g. Dengue, Leptospirosis

Plasma 

The main function of the plasma is transporting substances dissolved in it. 

Science | The Human Circulatory System 75

Some examples are given below;
 ²
 ²

It transports the digestive products, minerals and vitamins to the cells. 

It transports the excretory products during biochemical reactions within 
the cells to the excretory organs. 

 ² Plasma transports hormones, proteins, enzymes and gases to the relevant 

parts of the body.

6.4    Blood transfusion

The transfer of blood from one individual to another is known as blood transfusion. 
The person who donates blood is called the donor and the person who receives is 
called the recipient. However, blood transfusion is not possible between any two 
individuals.

For a transfusion to take place, compatibility
of  the  blood  group  and  the  Rhesus  factor 
between  the  donor  and  the  recipient  is 
compulsory. 

Compatibility of the blood group 

There  are  four  blood  groups  as  A,  B,  AB 
and O depending on the protein components 
present in blood cells. 
Compatibility  of  blood  groups  in  transfusion  is  represented  in  the  table  6.1. 
(√  represent  positive  compatibility  of  blood  group  while  «  represent  lack  of 
compatibility of blood group)

According  to  the  table,  blood  group AB  can  receive  blood  from  all  other  blood 
groups. Therefore, blood group AB is called the universal recipient.

Blood group O can donate to all the other blood groups. Therefore, blood group O 
is called the universal donor.

Figure 6.7 - Compatibility of blood group

For a blood transfusion, not only the blood group, but also the Rhesus factor (Rh 
factor) must be compatible. 

Compatibility of Rhesus factor

If the Rhesus factor is present in one’s blood it is considered as Rh+ and if Rhesus 
factor is absent, it is considered as Rh-. The recipients who are Rh+ can receive both 
Rh+ and Rh- blood. However, the Rh- recipients can receive Rh- blood only. The 
table 6.2 shows the compatibility of blood with Rhesus factor.
(√ represent positive compatibility of blood with Rhesus factor while « represent

BLOOD COLLECTION

Blood agglutination

Clumping of  the  transfused  blood  particles in  the  body  of  the  recipient is  called 
agglutination. 

This happens when the blood groups of donor and recipient are incompatible.

Blood clotting/ coagulation is an important process that prevents excessive bleeding 
when there is an injury or internal bleeding. This coagulation mechanism differs 
from the coagulation mechanism of agglutination. 

When  there  is  an  injury  or  bleeding,  the  platelets  at  the  damaged  blood  vessels 
breakdown and the resulting chemical process forms a blood clot to stop bleeding.

Maintaining  a  proper  functioning  of  the  blood  circulatory  system  is  vital  for  a 
healthy life of a person.

Some favourable habits to maintain healthy blood circulation system

 ² Maintain mentally less stressful lifestyle
 ² Engage in physical exercises daily
 ² Maintain the correct Body Mass Index (BMI) value according to height and 

weight, with a healthy diet.

 ² Reduce salt consumption
 ² Control conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes

Substances

7.1   Introduction to plant growth substances

You  know  that  air,  water,  light  and  minerals 
are  essential  for  plant  growth.  It  has  been 
discovered that some chemical substances also 
affect towards the plant growth. 

Have  you  ever  thought  how  does  a  stem  of 
a  plant  grows  upwards  and  its  roots  grow 
downwards  after 
the  seed  germination? 
Observe the figures 7.1 a and 7.1 b .

Have you ever thought how does a stem of a 
plant grows upwards and its roots grow downwards even the plant pot falls down? 
Let us do the activity 7.1 to study about it.

Figure 7.1 a

Figure 7.1 b

Activity 7.1

You will need :-  Two similar potted plants  

Method:-  
 y Cut and remove the apex of one plant. Then,  

measure the heights of both plants.

 y Supply same environmental conditions for both 
       plants and measure their heights daily for a week.

Figure 7.2

You will observe that the plant with the apex grows and its height increases while 
the height of the plant without the apex does not change. So, we can guess that there 
is an effect of the apex on plants to increase their height. Let us do the activity 7.2 
to find out more about it.

Activity 7.2

You will need :- Two similar potted plants, a box covered with a black paper 

Method:- 
 y Cut and remove the apex of one plant.
 y Place the two plants inside the box in a way that both plants get light only 

from one direction.

 Science | Plant Growth Substances 83

 
 
 
Auxins, produced in the apex diffuse downwards. It speeds up the growth of new 
cells and the shoot of the plant grows upwards. IAA (Indole Acetic Acid) is a natural 
growth substance found in plants.
Auxin concentrate more in the side of plant where intensity of light fall is low and 
auxin concentrate less in the other side of the plant. Auxin move to the darker side 
of the plant, causing the cells there to grow longer than corresponding cells on the 
other side of the plant. This causes a curving 
of the plant stem tip towards the light. This 
is known as positive phototropic movement. 
Auxin also inhibit the growth of lateral buds 
(figure 7.5).

Pruning  of  plant  apex  is  practised  in 
horticuture to maintain bushy plants.

Gibberellins 

Figure 7.5 - Growth of lateral buds in 
Pomegranate plant

Gibberellin promotes mainly the elongation
of the stem and growth of the fruits.

Cytokinins

Cytokinin accelerates the cell division. So, 
the  growth  of  flowers,  leaves,  fruits  and 
roots get accelerated.  They stimulate seed 
germination and delay plant ageing.

Cabbage plant due to 
gibberellin

of rooting in plants 
using Cytokinin

Abscisic acid is a plant growth substance. It is a chemical substance that cause 
closing  of  stomata  when  the  plant  experiences  shortage  of  water.  Thus,  it 
decreases transpiration. 

Ethene is a simple organic compound which produces in low amounts in plants. 
It is necessary for ripening of fruits. In ripening, starch stored in plants converted 
to sugar. If a plant is damaged, ethene released to the wound area and a new 
tissue forms to recover the wound.   

 Science | Plant Growth Substances 85

       
 
What is the reason for falling leaves and fruits when matured?

When you observe a stalk of a naturally fallen leaf and a stalk of a broken leaf, 
it would be clear to you that, the naturally fallen leaf stalk has a clear abscission 
layer. The  reason  for  making  an  abscission  layer  is,  the  reduction  results  in  the 
amount of growth substances in fruits and leaves with their maturity. As a result, 
fruit fall and leaf fall take place in plants. 

7.2   Uses of artificial growth substances

Artificial growth substances are widely used in horticulture and growing ornamental 
plants. Some of these are given in the table 7.1.

8.3   Support and movements of plants

Support of plants

Just like in animals, tissues are present within plants for the purpose of mechanical 
support. Figure 8.5 shows the garden Balsam plant. You may have noticed on sunny 
days these plants get withered and the stem is bent down. This is due to lack of 
water supply to the plant.
To keep non-woody plants erect and alive it is vital to have water inside the plant, 
where as woody plants can be kept erect in low water percentages due to presence 
of various chemical substances such as cellulose, lignin deposited in the walls in 
heartwood of the plant. They give rigidity to the plant (figure 8.6).

Figure 8.5 - Non-woody plant (Balsam)

Figure 8.6 -  Woody plant (Mango)

Movements of plants
Growth of a part in a plant as a response to a stimulus or change of the location due 
to a turgor change , is known as a movement of a plant. These responses can be 
catogorized into two main groups as,

 ²
Tropic movements
 ² Nastic movements

Tropic movements

Tropic movements are growth or movements that occur due to a direct influence 
between  the  direction  of  stimulus  and  direction  of  response.  Tropic  movements 
occur due to the effect of growth substances. Response may be towards or away 
from the stimulus. Positive tropism occurs towards the stimulus. Negative tropism 
occurs away from the stimulus.

92

Science | Support and Movements of Organisms

Some of tropic movements are described below.

 y Positive geotropism 
 y Negative geotropism 
 y Positive phototropism 
 y Positive hydrotropism 
 y Positive chemotropism  - growth of the pollen along the tube towards 

roots growing towards the ground

Let us do activity 8.3 to study about tropic movements. 

Activity 8.3

You will need:- Two pots, s ome green    
                          gram seeds
Method :- 
 y
Plant 5 soaked seeds in each pot.
 y After  seed  germination,  keep  one 
healthy plant in each pot and uproot 
all the other plants.

 y Keep one pot vertical and the other 
toppled down as in the figure 8.7.

Figure 8.7

 y Observe the growth pattern of root and shoot after one week.
 y

Identify and study tropic movements.

In both pots, roots grow towards ground.
That means movement of a plant root is 
positive  geotropic,  and  movement  of  a 
plant shoot is negative geotropic (figure 
8.8), as it move.

Figure 8.8

Science | Support and Movements of Organisms 93

 
Nastic movements
In nastic movements, response of the direction 
does  not  depend  on  the  direction  of  stimulus 
(The direction of these movements are specific). 
Response is always towards a specific direction; 
irrespective of  the direction of stimulus. This 
reaction is not related with growth substances 
triggered by external stimulus. Most of them are 
movements  due  to  turgor  change.  In  legume 
plants, a structure called pulvinus is located as a 
swelling at the base of the petiole or leaflet. It 
contains  parenchyma  cells,  which  move 
according to the changes in turgor pressure.
Some of nastic movements are as follows.
 ² Nyctinastic movements - sleeping or shrinking of leaves of 'Kathurumurunga' 
/ 'Agaththi', tamarind, Mimosa and 'Nelli' / 'Nellikkai' leaves when dark falls
 ² Haptonastic  movement  -  sleeping  or  shrinking  of  Mimosa  leaves,  when  the

stimulus is touched
Seismonastic movement  - exhibiting sleeping movement during a shock 
Photonastic movement - blooming of flowers with the sunrise

Let us do the activity 8.4 to study about responses of plant parts

Activity 8.4

You will need :- Mimosa plants
Method :- 
 y Touch the leaves of a Mimosa plant.
 y Make a vibration without touching the leaves.
 y Report your observations.
 y Report  if  there  are  any  special  features  in  the  plants  responsible  for  these 

movements.

When you touch a Mimosa plant the leaves show the
sleep movement. It is a haptonastic movement. When 
you create a vibration without touching, the leaves of 
the Mimosa plant show the sleep movement. It is a 
seismonastic movement. 
The pulvinus located at each leaflet and petiole base 
help  for  these  movements  of  the  plant.  Pvlvini  are 
also present in plants showing sleeping movement at 
dust with the decrease of sunlight.
e.g. 'Kathurumurunga', Tamarind, 'Nelli'

For extra knowledge

Tactic movements  
In addition to tropic movements and nastic movements there is a type of movement 
known as tactic, which is related with the direction of stimulus. In tactic movement, 
the whole organism responds to the stimulus.
e.g. Small Algal Species like Chlamydomonas

In-situ Conservation
Although plants show movements they cannot locomote like animals. Animals can 
avoid external hazards by locomotion.
Plants  grow  in  a  habitat,  where  all  necessary  external  factors  needed  to  growth 
are present. Hence, plants can get destroyed in its habitat due to external hazards. 
Therefore, it is essential to conserve plants in their own habitat. Conservation of 
an organism, in its living environment is known as in-situ conservation. Strictly 
reserved forests which protect indigenous plants like ebony, satinwood, vitex are 
examples for in-situ conservation. These species of organisms can also be protected 
by conserving sensitive zones of environment.

Summary

 ² Animals use pseudopodia, cilia, flagella and muscles for their locomotion.
 ² Chordates use bones and muscles connected to the bones for movements.
 ² For a movement to take place, muscles must have the ability to contract,

stretch and recoil to their original resting length after stretched or contracted.

 ² Skeletal system and the muscles give the body a shape and rigidity.
 ² Even though plants do not show locomotion, they show movements.
 ² Movements of plants are categorized as tropic movements and nastic
  movements.
 ² Conservation of an organism in its living environment, is known as in-situ 

conservation.

The Evolutionary
Process

Diversity  of  living  organisms  in  our  environment  is  a  result  of  the  evolutionary 
process. When studying about the evolution it is important to consider about the 
origin of the universe and origin of the life.

In the past, there were many beliefs about the origin of the universe. 

9.1    Origin of the Earth

It is believed that the origin of the Earth took place about 4.5 billion years ago. 

Nebular theory is the first scientific explanation of the origin of the solar system. 
According to this theory, small particles of materials in the universe drew together 
by the force of gravity, clumped up, and the galaxies, the sun and other planets were 
formed. 

Big Bang theory can be considered as the modern theory about the origin of the 
Earth. According to this theory, universe was an energy source with a great energy. 
A giant explosion took place in it and large clouds of dust particles were created. 
These dust particles clumped up together and the galaxies were created. It is said in 
the big bang theory that, our solar system was created in the galaxy known as the 
milky way galaxy.  

Figure 9.1 - Illustration of the Big Bang
Initially the Earth had been a very hot object and its volcanic activities were high. 
The Earth got gradually cooled and less volatile metals with high density formed 
the core of the Earth. It is believed that, Earth's crust was created later, by light 
silicon rocks.

Various types of elements at the centre of the Earth reacted with each other and 

different types of gases were formed. At first the atmosphere of the Earth had gases 

such as Carbon dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4) and Hydrogen sulphide (H2S). The 

absence of Oxygen (O2) in the early atmosphere is a  significant fact.

Initially, the extreme heat of the Earth caused evaporation of water on the planet. 

This evaporated water got condensed and clouds were formed. Water droplets in 

these clouds joined together and dropped onto the Earth as rain. There had been 

continuous heavy rains on the Earth for many years. This rain water which was rich 

with minerals, collected in lower lands and oceans were formed.

Figure 9.2 - Illustrations of primitive Earth

9.2   Origin of life on the Earth 

There are many beliefs and theories on origin of life on the Earth. It is believed that, 

about 3.5 billion years ago life originated on the Earth. 

Let us consider some theories about origin of life on the Earth.

Theory of special creation

According  to  this  theory,  all  living  organisms  on  Earth  were  created  by  a  super 

natural power. Since there is no scientific evidence to prove this theory, scientist do

manner.

e.g. 

 y Rats who born from pieces of clothes

 y Maggots who born from rotten meat

 y Weevils who born from decayed wood

The  Spontaneous  generation  theory  has  been  effectively  disproved  by  the 

experiments conducted by the scientist Louis Pasteur.

For extra knowledge

Louis  Pasteur  prepared  an  experiment  to 
prove that spontaneous generation theory 
is not an acceptable theory.

 y Similar  amounts  of  sterilized  nutritional 
media was added to two similar swan neck 
flasks. No growth of living organisms was 
observed.

Louis Pasteur

 y After about one year neck of the one flask was broken and taken away. 
 y Microbial growth was visible in the flask without the neck and no life appeared 

in the other flask.

 y As  the  conclusion,  it  was  stated  that  living  organisms  do  not  generate  

spontaneously. This was accepted as true in 1862.

Cosmozoic theory
This theory suggests that, the living materials might have got established on Earth 
from a fallen meteor with living organisms or by space crafts from other planets. 
This theory has not been proved scientifically.

Theory of biochemical evolution
This theory confirms that, at the beginning of the Earth, the gases in the atmosphere 
reacted with each other and the ingredients that make life possible were formed. 
It is believed that the energy required for this was supplied by electric discharges 
during lightning, eruption of volcanoes and by the ultra violet radiation of the sun. 
These materials dissolved in rain water and collected in oceans. This mixture was 
known as the primordial soup.

The first living cell or the pre-cell appeared as a result of a bio chemical reaction in 
primordial soup. The first organism was unicellular and was considered anaerobic 
and heterotrophic. 

Scientists have experimentally shown that the first living cell was created by the 
primordial soup.

The first form of life on the Earth is considered to be a simple unicellular bacterium. 
Then, the first photosynthetic organisms, unicellular algae were formed. After that, 
an atmosphere containing gaseous oxygen was formed.

Many  changes  took  place  for  a  long  time  period  within  the  body  of  unicellular 
organisms and multicellular organisms were born. Gradually, tissues, organs and 
systems  were  specialized  within  these  multicellular  organisms  and  the  world  of 
animals and plants were created.

Cnidarians,  some  annelids  and  some  arthropods  are  considered  as  the  first 
multicellular organisms. 

The fish are considered as the first type of vertebrates, and amphibians originated 
from  fish. Amphibians  can  be  regarded  as  the  first  vertebrates  that  entered  into 
terrestrial environment. Reptiles evolved as a result of gradual evolutionary changes 
occurred in amphibians. The reptiles are completely adapted to the terrestrial life 
than amphibians. It is believed that birds and mammals evolved from reptiles during 
evolution. 

The  evolution  of  human  took  place  about  12  million  years  ago.  Modern  human 
originated about 5 million (5 000 000) years ago. 

The world of plants evolved by the gradual changes resulted in photosynthetic algae 
on the oceans. First, less developed plants originated which, was then followed by  
non-flowering plants and flowering plants at last.

Importance of evolution in bio-diversity

9.4 
There is a competition among animals for the limited resources in the environment. 
The  creatures  who  succeed,  will  be  naturally  selected  and  be  established  in  the 
environment. These selected organisms become pioneers in the environment and 
their population increases. These creatures have created a large bio-diversity in the 
natural environment. In the process of evolution, novel species can also be evolved 
from  former  species. This  is  known  as  speciation  and  this  process  broadens  the 
biodiversity further. 

For extra knowledge

Charles Darwin is considered 
as the father of evolution. 
He put forwarded the 
Natural selection theory 
which is a scientifically 
accepted theory about 
evolution.

Foreword

The  educational  objectives  of  the  contemporary  world 
are becoming more complex along with the economic, social, cultural and 
technological development. The learning and teaching process too is changing 
in  relation  to  human  experiences,  technological  differences,  research  and 
new indices. Therefore, it is required to produce the textbook by including 
subject  related  information  according  to  the  objectives  in  the  syllabus  in 
order to maintain the teaching process by organizing learning experiences 
that suit to the learner needs. The textbook is not merely a learning tool for 
the learner. It is a blessing that contributes to obtain a higher education along 
with a development of conduct and attitudes, to develop values and to obtain 
learning experiences.

The government in its realization of the concept of free 
education has offered you all the textbooks from grades 1-11. I would like 
to remind you that you should make the maximum use of these textbooks 
and protect them well. I sincerely hope that this textbook would assist you to 
obtain the expertise to become a virtuous citizen with a complete personality 
who would be a valuable asset to the country.

I would like to bestow my sincere thanks on the members 
of the editorial and writer boards as well as on the staff of the Educational 
Publications Department who have strived to offer this textbook to you.

Introduction

This textbook was compiled by the Educational Publications Department in accordance 
with the syllabus prepared by the National Institute of Education for the use of Grade 9 
students in the Sri Lankan school system with effect from 2018.
An effort has made here to arrange the subject content to suit the national educational 
goals,  common  national  competencies,  the  objectives  of  teaching  science  and  the 
content of the syllabus.
The  subject  of  science  directs  the  student  towards  a  more  active  learning  process  in 
a  manner  as  to  develop  knowledge,  skills  and  attitudes  needed  for  a  developmental 
scientific thought.
In  the  compilation  of  this  textbook,  subject  content  is  largely  arranged  based  on 
experiences of daily life. It has contributed to prove the fact that the subject of science is 
very much closer to the day to day life.
The compilation of this textbook based on activities is a distinctive feature. The activities 
are prepared based on the scientific method in order to develop knowledge, skills and 
attitudes.  Activities  that  can  be  performed  individually  at  home  as  well  as  in  school 
are incorporated here. We believe that learning through activities would contribute to 
create a liking and an interest in the child towards learning science. 
At the end of each chapter, a summary, a series of exercises and a glossary were included. 
It enables the student to identify the important details of the chapter as well as to self 
evaluate the achievement of learning outcomes.
For the purpose of directing the student to study further about the subject matter, more 
information is included in the "For extra knowledge". It is given only to broaden the 
subject area of the child and certainly not to ask questions at term tests.
Assignments and projects are given with the purpose of directing the student towards 
an explorative study. It enables the students to develop the higher order skills such as 
application, analysis and synthesis of the concepts achieved from the lesson.
We strongly believe that the duty of the teachers who teach science is to direct the student 
for self learning instead of teaching the student using traditional teaching methods. This 
textbook can be utilized by the teachers as a learning tool to execute their teaching role 
properly. 
We would like to bestow our sincere thanks on the professional writer Dr. K. Ariyasinghe.
We kindly request you to forward your comments and suggestions on this textbook to 
the Educational Publications Department.

10.1   Electrolysis 

Electrolysis

There  was  a  news  item  of  a  woman  who  has  been  cooking  food  keeping  an 
aluminum pan on a electric leaky hot plate was struck with an electric shock when 
she was pouring coconut milk into the curry. She had got the shock even though 
she was not touching the pan. How would this have happened? The leaking electric 
current should have passed through coconut milk and entered the woman's body. 
Your elders  must have told  you that connecting electric plugs with wet hands is 
dangerous. The reason for the electric leaks stated above should be the conduction 
of electricity through a liquid medium. 

Let  us  do  activity  10.1  to  find  out  whether  electricity  is  conducted  through  any 
substance in liquid state. 

Activity 10.1

You will need :-   A  beaker,  two  carbon  rods,  an  ammeter,  two  dry  cells  (1.5 
V), connecting wires, kerosene, salt solution, acidified water, 
copper sulphate solution, distilled water

Method:- 
 ² Connect the ammeter and the two dry cells 
to the two carbon rods as shown in the figure. 
10.1.  Dip  the  two  carbon  rods  partially  in 
the liquid/solution.

+     -

 ² Pour the liquids/solutions given above into 

Liquid or Solution

the beaker.

 ² Observe whether there is a deflection in the 

ammeter.

 ² Tabulate your observation.

Figure 10.1

It is seen here that the ammeter deflects only when some liquids/solutions are used.

Indicator of the ammeter deflects when  a current passes  through  it. Therefore, a 
current has passed through the solutions resulting a deflection in the ammeter. The 
solutions of salt, copper sulphate and acidified water, all contain mobile ions. These 
solutions conduct electricity through these mobile ions. Liquids or solutions which 
conduct electricity are called electrolytes. 

Since kerosene and distilled water do not conduct electricity, they do not bring about 
a  deflection  in  the  ammeter.  Such  liquids/solutions  do  not  conduct  electricity  as 
they do not contain mobile ions. Liquids/solutions which do not conduct electricity 
are referred to as non-electrolytes.  

Compounds  such  as  sodium  chloride  and  copper  sulphate  are  known  as  ionic 
compounds. They exist in the solid state. They are made up of oppositely charged 
ions formed by the relevant atoms. You will be able to learn more about them in 
grade 10. 

Although,  there  are  ions  in  solid  ionic  compounds  they  cannot  move  freely. 
Hence,  those  compounds  do  not  conduct  electricity  in  the  solid  state.  But,  if  an 
ionic  compound  is  dissolved  in  water  to  give  an  aqueous  solution,  the  ions  in  it 
become mobile. Thus, aqueous solutions of ionic compounds are good conductors 
of electricity.  

When an ionic solid is heated and brought to the liquid state, it is called a fused 
substance.  Ions  in  a  fused  liquid  also  can  move. Accordingly,  Ionic  compounds 
conduct electricity in the fused state.

10.2   Changes caused in a solution by an electric current 

When electricity is conducted through an electrolyte, the conductors through which 
the  electric  current  enters  the  electrolyte  and  exits  are  called  electrodes.  In  the 
activity 10.1 above the electric current enters the solution by one carbon electrode 
and exits from the solution through the other carbon electrode.

through the copper sulphate solution. 

 ² Note down your observations.

The electrode connected to the positive terminal of the external supply of electricity 
is called the positive electrode. The electrode connected to the negative terminal 
of the external supply of electricity is called the negative electrode. In the above 
activity  it  can  be  observed  the  deposition  of  a  reddish  brown  substance  at  the 
negative  electrode  and  the  liberation  of  gas  bubbles  at  the  positive  electrode. A 
gradual decrease in the blue colour can also be observed in the solution. Hence, it 
is clear that the compounds contained in the beaker undergo a chemical change. 

This chemical change is caused by the electric current passed through the solution. 
Here, copper is deposited on the negative electrode and oxygen gas is liberated at 
the positive electrode. Copper sulphate undergoing the chemical change has turned 
into  copper,  a  simpler  substance.  The  chemical  change  effected  by  passing  an 
electric current through an electrolyte is known as electrolysis. During this process, 
the electrolyte is converted into more simpler components. 

A  substance  that  doesn't  react  chemically  with  the  electrolyte  referred  as  inert 
electrodes. Carbon (graphite) and platinum electrodes are such examples. 

Electrolysis of acidulated water

By activity 10.2, we learnt that in an electrolysis, an electrolyte is converted into 
more simpler products. To explore more about this, let us find out the products of 
the electrolysis of acidulated water. For this let us go ahead with activity 10.3.

In this activity, it can be observed that gas bubbles evolve at the electrodes. The 
gases evolved get collected in the test tubes. The volume of the gas collected at the 
negative electrode is approximately twice the volume of the gas collected at the 
positive electrode. 

It can be examined that hydrogen gas (H2) evolves at the negative electrode and 
oxygen gas (O2) evolves at the positive electrode. 
If the gas evolved at the positive electrode is collected and tested with a glowing 
splint  is  put  into  it,  the  splint  reignites. This  verifies  that  the  gas  evolved  at  the 
positive electrode is oxygen. Similarly, if the gas evolved at the negative electrode 
is separated and a lighted splint is put into it, the gas burns with a squeaky "pop" 
sound. This confirms that the gas evolved at the negative electrode is hydrogen. 

Thus, during electrolysis, water is splitted into more simpler substances, hydrogen 
and oxygen. 

Applications of electrolysis 
Electrolysis is frequently used in various industries.

10.3   Electroplating

Recall the observations of activity 10.2. you would have observed the deposition of 
copper on the negative electrode. By engaging in the activity 10.4, let us investigate 
whether copper can be deposited on a certain object. 

Activity 10.4

You will need :-  Aqueous  copper  sulphate 
solution,  a  clean  copper 
plate, a cleaned iron nail, a 
beaker,  connecting  wires, 
two dry cells of 1.5 V

Method :-
 ² Connect  dry  cells  to  the  copper  plate  and 
the iron nail as shown in figure 10.4 and dip 
them at once in the copper sulphate solution. 

 ² Record your observations.

In the activity 10.4, you can observe that the copper plate gradually dissolves and 
copper is deposited on the iron nail. The plating of a certain metal on another surface 
using electricity is referred to as electroplating. 

For electroplating, the metal that needs to be plated should be used as the positive 
electrode  and  the  object  that  is  plated  should  be  used  as  the  negative  electrode. 
Further, the electrolyte used needs to be a solution of a salt of the metal that should 
be plated. 

Assignment 10.1

1.  Electroplating silver on an iron plate

2.  Electroplating gold on a copper ring

Draw figures of suitable apparatus (as in figure 10.4) for no 1 and 2 instances 
stating the positive electrode, negative electrode and the electrolyte in each case.

Take the iron nail you used in activity 10.4 to your hand and touch its plating with 
your fingers. You will observe that the copper plating will get removed from the 
nail and comes to your finger tips.

This shows that the plating occurred in this way is not in good quality. 
Let us consider the characteristics of a high quality electroplating. 

 ² The coating should firmly adhere to the surface subjected to plating. 
 ² The coating should be of confirm thickness.
 ² The coating should be shiny.

Such a high quality plating occurs when the electrochemical change take place very 
slowly. The electrolyte (salt solution) used for this has to be very dilute. 

The chemical change occurring can also be slowed down by passing a very low 
current  through  the  solution.  This  can  be  effected  by  applying  a  low  potential 
difference. 

In  chemical  industries,  high  quality  electroplating  is  done  by  controlling  the 
conditions appropriately. 

Plating of metals like nickel and chromium on iron trays is an example. This gives 
a beautiful silver appearance to the tray. 

Applications of electroplating

Pay your attention to vases, trays, cutlery and door locks offering a golden or silvery 
lustre which are being used at home. Very often the luster of these objects is due to 
a metal layer deposited on them. In order to prevent rusting of the parts of motor 
vehicles, they are coated with a thin metallic layer by electroplating. Mostly metals 
like copper (Cu), silver (Ag), gold (Au), nickel (Ni) and chromium (Cr) are plated 
like this. In such instances, the metal plate has a certain property which is lacking in 
the metal which is subjected to plating. Resistance to corrosion, attractive colour, 
luster and good finish are some of such properties. 

 ² Electroplating  nickel  metal  on  iron  tray 
protects  it  from  rusting  and  also  gives  it 
an attractive appearance.

 ² Electroplating  a  copper  jewellery  with 
gold  adds  value  to  it  and  gives  it  a  rich 
look.

Summary 

 ² Liquids/ solutions which conduct electricity are called electrolytes.
 ² The  reason  for  the  electrical  conductivity  of  electrolytes  is  the  presence  of 

mobile ions in them.

 ² Liquids/solutions which do not conduct electricity are called non electrolytes. 

They do not contain mobile ions.

 ² Though ionic compounds contain ions, they cannot move in the solid state. 

Therefore, solid ionic compounds do not conduct electricity.

 ² Aqueous solutions and fused liquids of ionic compounds conduct electricity. 
 ² The chemical changes taking place at the electrodes when an electric current 

is passed through an electrolyte is referred to as electrolysis.

 ² During  electrolysis,  chemical  compounds  are  splitted  into  more  simpler 

compounds or elements. 

 ² By  electrolyzing  acidulated  water,  water  can  be  turned  into  the  elements, 

hydrogen and  oxygen. 

 ² Coating one metal with another metal by passing an electric current is called 

electroplating. 

 ² When electroplating, always the metal that is subjected to plating should be 

kept as the negative electrode. 

 ² During electrolysis the metal that is plated is kept the anode while a solution 

of a salt of that metal is used as the electrolyte.

 ² A  high  quality  plating  occurs  when  the  chemical  changes  at  the  electrodes 

occur very slowly. 

 ² To  obtain  a  high  quality  plating  in  chemical  industry,  conditions  are 

 ²

appropriately controlled. 
In electroplating, it is expected that the metal that is plated possesses superior 
qualities to that of the surface being plated.

Density 

11.1   Introduction to density
In a glass of drinking water, contains a small volume of water and the mass of it is 
also small. In a well, there is a large volume of water and the mass of it is also large. 
But, when a reservoir is considered, the volume of water it contains is massive and 
the mass of it is also massive (figure 11.1).  

(a) Glass of water

(b) Well

Figure 11.1

(c) Reservoir

Though the volume of a substance and its mass differs, there is a common relationship 
between those two. Let us do the activity 11.1 to reveal this.

Activity 11. 1

You will need :-   Measuring cylinders of varied capacities 100 ml, 250 ml and 

500  ml,  a  500  ml  beaker,  a  triple 
beam balance, water

Method :-
 ² Adjust the triple beam balance to its zero mark. 
 ² Measure  the  mass  of  cleaned  and  dried  500  ml 

empty beaker using this balance.

 ² Measure  100  ml  of  water  into  the  beaker  using 

100 ml measuring cylinder.

 ² Measure the mass of beaker with water.
 ² Measure the mass of 250 ml and 500 ml of water 

separately using the same beaker.

 ² Divide  the  mass  of  water  by  its  volume  and  find 

the ratio in each instance above.

According  to  the  above  activity,  it  is  clear  that  the  ratio  of  mass  of  water  to  its 
volume is constant, though the volume taken differs. This constant value is specific 
for water. And this value is known as the density. 

Density = 

    Mass

Volume

Density can be explained as the ratio between mass and volume. 

The density can be defined as follows. 

The  mass  per  unit  volume  of  a  substance  is  known  as  the  density  of  that 
substance. 

Density, mass and volume are symbolized by ρ, m and v respectively.
The formula for density is ρ = m
v   

11.2  Units of density
The measurements taken in activity 11.1 above, units of density can be deduced as 
follows.

Density =

But, according to the Standard International (SI) units, mass is measured in kg and 
volume in m3. Thus;

Standard units (SI) of density =

SI unit of mass

= kg m-3

=

The Standard Units (SI) of density is kg m-3 (kilogram per cubic meter).

Now let us do the activity 11.2 to compare the densities of several substances.

Activity 11.2

You will need :-  A measuring cylinder of 250 ml, a beaker of 250 ml, enough 
water, coconut oil, kerosene, concentrated salt solution, a triple 
beam balance

Method :- 
 ² Clean and dry the beaker of 250 ml and measure the mass of it using the triple 

beam balance

 ² Measure 250 ml of water by using the measuring cylinder of 250 ml. Then put 

into the beaker. Measure the mass of beaker with water.

 ² Remove water and measure 250 ml of concentrated salt solution. Then, put  

into the beaker. Measure the mass of beaker with salt solution.

 ² Same way, measure 250 ml of coconut oil and kerosene separately into the 

same beaker and measure their masses.

 ² Note that the beaker and the measuring cylinder should be well cleaned and 

dried before measuring coconut oil and kerosene.

 ² Tabulate your readings and work out the calculation as shown in the following

According  to  this  activity,  it  can  be  seen  that  the  ratio  of  mass  to  its  volume  is 
different for different substances, though their volumes are equal. 

Density of various substances differ from each other. It is a specific property of the 
respective substance. Substances can be identified by the value of their density. This 
is common for solids as well as for liquids. Therefore, density is a vital physical 
quantity of a substance. 

Let us study how to solve the problems regarding density.

11.3   Hydrometers

If  you  want  to  find  the  density  of  a  liquid,  you  can  measure  the  volume  and 
mass  of  it  and  calculate  the  density,  as  you  have  done  in  activity  11.2.  But  it  is 
a time-consuming difficult process. Therefore, to measure the density of a liquid 
easily, an equipment known as hydrometer is used. 

Figure 11.3 shows several types of hydrometers. Hydrometer is made of a thin glass 
tube, the lower part of which is blow to form a bulb. This bulb is filled with lead 
shots, so that a part of the tube is submerged and float vertically in the liquid.

 Science | Density

 
 
 
 
 
 
When a hydrometer is partially immersed and floating 
in a liquid, the length of the immersed part depends on 
the density of the liquid. It sinks less in high-density 
liquids  and  more  in  low-density  liquids.  The  upper 
tubular part of the hydrometer is calibrated in such a 
way  that  density  can  directly  read  by  the  depth  it 
immerse. 

Figure 11.3 - Different types 
of hydrometers

Liquid A

It is shown that the same hydrometer is made 
to  float  in  three  different  liquids  in  figure 
11.4.  Figure  11.4  (b)  shows  how  it  floats  in 
water. Immersed height of the hydrometer is less in liquid A, than in water (figure 
11.4 (b)). It indicates that density of liquid A is higher than that of water. Immersed 
length of the hydrometer is more in liquid C than in water (figure 11.4 (c)). So, the 
density of liquid C is lower than that of water.

The density of the salty water of the dead 
sea located in between Israel and Jordan 
is very high. It has the ability of floating a 
man without sinking.

liquids.

A simple hydrometer can easily be made by you using a drinking straw. Engage in 
the activity 11.4. 

Activity 11.4

You will need :- A drinking straw, a candle, several iron balls of the diameter of 
3 mm, a measuring cylinder, 250 ml of coconut oil, 250 ml of 
concentrated salt solution and water. 

Method :-
 ² Heat one end of the drinking straw in the candle flame to seal it.
 ² Add enough water into the density jar or the measuring cylinder. 
 ² Put iron balls into the straw so that it floats vertically while 2/3 of its length is 

immersed in water. 

 ² Mark the floating level on the straw, while it is in water. Now you have finished 

making the hydrometer. 

 ² Add  salt  water  into  the  measuring  cylinder  and  float  the  hydrometer  in  it. 

Mark the level of floating on the hydrometer.

 ² Repeat the above step using coconut oil as the liquid. 
 ² Decide whether the density of the liquids used is higher or lower than that of 

water, according to the levels of floating.

Use of hydrometers 

Cow's  milk  contains  approximately  90%  of  water.  Other  than  water,  it  contains 
lipids, protein etc. Because of the contribution of the density of other constituents, 
density of milk is slightly higher than that of water. Amount of water in milk can be 
determined by measuring the density of it, using a hydrometer. This measurement 
can  be  used  to  decide  whether  water  is  added  to  milk.  Hydrometers  which  are 
specially made to measure the density of milk are known as lactometers. 

Hydrometers are also used to measure the percentage of alcohol in alcoholic drinks, 
like wine and beer. Those are known as alcoholmeters. These alcoholic drinks also 
contain  high  percentage  of  water.  Therefore,  the  density  of  alcoholic  drinks  are 
slightly different from density of water.

The density of the acid, changes according to the changes in lead-acid batteries used 
in vehicles. Therefore, the condition of batteries can be examined by measuring the 
density with a hydrometer. 

Soil  hydrometer  is  used  in  determining  composition  of  a  soil  sample.  It  can  be 
concluded by dissolving a constant mass of soil, in a constant volume of water to 
calculate the density of soil solution.

Sea water contain high amount of salt dissolved in it. There is a special hydrometer 
called seawater hydrometer, used to measure the density of sea water. Due to high 
concentration of salts, the density of sea water is higher than normal  fresh water. 

Composition of Rubber is also measured by special hydrometer known as metrolac.

Bio-diversity

12.1    Introduction to bio-diversity
Recall the field visits you attended to study about the environment. During those 
field visits you would have experienced different types of environments. They can 
be beaches, mangrove environments, forests, monsoon forests and grasslands.  A 
system that includes all living organisms (biotic factors) in an area as well as its 
physical  environment  (abiotic  factors)  interacting  with  one  another  as  a  unit  is 
known as an ecosystem. Study the ecosystems in figure 12.1.

Figure 12.1 - Some ecosystems

When different ecosystems are considered, the animals and plants in these systems are 
varied. The physical environment and climatic factors of those ecosystems are also 
different. The diversity among these ecosystems is known as ecosystem diversity.

Think  about  the  living  organisms  in  ecosystems.  In  ecosystems  there  are  many 
species of animals and plants as well as many species of micro-organisms. With 
regard to these species, there is a great variety of characteristics in the body shape, 
size,  nutritional  patterns  and  reproduction.  The  diversity  among  the  species  is 
known as species diversity.

Modern man belongs to the species 
Homo  sapiens  sapiens.  Through 
the  above  activity  you  would  have 
understood that even within the same 
species there are differences among 
the individuals.

You  can  understand  the  differences 
among the human by figure 12.3.

The reason for these differences of a 
certain species is genetic diversity. 
You will learn about genes in grade 
10 & 11.

For extra knowledge

Figure 12.3 - Humans of Homo sapiens sapiens with 
different  features

You already know that living organisms are made up of cells. Chromosomes 
are located in nucleus of these cells. Genes are located on these chromosomes. 
The features of living organisms are controlled by genes. Genetic diversity is 
the cause for the differences among organisms within the same species.

There is a diversity among the ecosystems that organisms live and there is a diversity 
among the living species. Not only that, there is a diversity among the organisms 
of a same species. Bio-diversity is a combination of ecosystem diversity, species 
diversity and genetic diversity. 

12.2   Importance of bio-diversity

Both large and small creatures in an ecosystem play a significant role in maintaining 
the equilibrium of the certain ecosystem. Higher bio-diversity in an ecosystem also 
increases the wellbeing and the stability of that ecosystem.

The  beauty  of  the  environment  increases  due  to  bio-diversity. We  know  that  Sri 
Lanka is a country with a rich bio-diversity. Sri Lanka has been named as the country 
with the highest density of flowering plants, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals in 
the Asian region. Rich bio-diversity is a strong reason for tourist attraction. 

Bio-diversity  has  reduced  the  competition  between  the  species.  Organisms  are 
always in a competition for their needs. When considering the plant world, they are 
competing for the needs that should be used from the environment such as light, 
space, water and air. When considering the animal world, animals are competing for 
requirements such as habitat, food, security and choice of partners. Bio-diversity 
helps to minimize this competition among living organisms.

Let us see how bio-diversity acts, trees to minimize the competition for water. The 
roots of different trees are adapted to take water from different levels in the soil 
(figure 12.4).

plants

water from the atmosphere

Figure 12.4 - Roots adapted to minimize the competition for water

We know that the beaks of  different bird species are of  different shapes. This is 
important  to  reduce  the  competition  for  food.  Various  birds  depend  on  various 
foods and their beaks are shaped according to their diet (figure 12.5).

“The wild types” of most plants and animals used in agriculture are found in natural 
ecosystems. Genes that are resistant to pests, adverse environmental conditions and 
illnesses, are available in these “wild types”. Because of bio-diversity it is possible 
to use this genetic materials in a favourable manner in agriculture.

Due to bio-diversity some species are endemic to each region. Species that can be 
seen only in one geographical region or country are known as endemic species. 
Humans conserve these endemic species due to this rich bio-diversity.

This bio-diversity helps to protect the water resources and soil to maintain favourable 
climatic  conditions  and  minimize  environmental  pollution.  Bio-diversity  is  very 
important for entertainment, various research works and educational activities.

12.3      Threats to bio-diversity
There are many threats for bio-diversity. These threats have caused deterioration 
in bio-diversity. The reasons for biodegradation can be discussed under two topics.

Natural reasons
Since ancient times, bio-diversity has been affected by the impact of various natural 
activities. Collapsing meteors, volcanic explosions, tsunami, earth slides and floods 
are some of these natural reasons.
e.g.  It is considered that a meteor collapse caused for the extinction of dinosaurs. 
There  is  an  argument  that  natural  global  warming  was  the  reason  for  the 
extinction of mammoth.

Dinosaurs

Human activities

With the rapid increase in the human population, forests are destroyed extensively  
to meet their needs. Rapid deforestation destruct the habitats of living organisms. 
Also the construction of various buildings, streets and reservoirs splits the habitats 
of living organisms.

The increase in human population causes many environmental issues. Over use of 
resources and addition of pollutants to the environment are often caused by human 
activities. Soil, aquatic and airy ecosystems get so polluted and these ecosystems 
become unsuitable for survival of organisms. These reasons have a strong impact 
on bio-diversity.  

Spreading of invasive organisms in an ecosystem too, make a strong impact on its 
bio-diversity (figure 12.8).

Figure 12.8 - Some species of invasive organisms

The  introduction  of  genetically  modified  new  organisms  into  the  environment 
cause adverse impact on bio-diversity. Although, it is not yet possible to specify 
this, these organisms can be considered as a threat to bio-diversity in the future. 

Climatic changes due to environmental problems such as ozone layer depletion and  
global warming will affect the bio-diversity. 

These  threats  have  caused  bio-diversity  degradation  worldwide.  Hence,  some 
species  of  organisms  are  in  a  threat  of  extinction  from  the  Earth.  Therefore, 
bio-diversity should be conserved. The regions of higher density of living organisms 
are  called  hotspots.  To  be  considered  as  a  bio-diversity  hotspot,  a  country  or  a 
region should be rich with high proportion of indigenous species and species with 
more threats. As Sri Lanka belongs to a hotspot region, it is our duty to contribute 
for the conservation of bio-diversity.

You will understand that the environment contains living organisms (animals and 
plants) and non-living components.

All living organisms in a community and the physical environment interacting 
with them considered together as an ecosystem.
e.g. :- A pond, a forest, decaying log, coral reef environment, a grassland

Features of an ecosystem

1.  Interaction occur between living components as well as between non-living 

components.
Living - living relationships,  Living - non living relationships, 
Non living - non living relationships

2.  The energy flows through one way stream

The solar energy which is used by green plants in photosynthesis, is stored in 
the food produced during this process. The energy flows from lower consumer 
levels to the higher consumer levels through food chains or food webs.

3.  Recycling of materials

The materials that the organisms receive from the environment continue to be 
back to the environment. The continuous exchange of materials between the 
organisms and the environment is an important feature of an ecosystem.

4.  An independent Unit

Since there are constant interactions within the ecosystem it has ensured the 
existence in biosphere.

Let us see living - living relationships in an environment.

Living - living relationships
The  interactions  between  the  living  organisms  are  known  as  living-living 
relationships. These interactions are to meet the following needs.

 ² Food
 ² Security
 ² Reproduction

Following are some such interactions.
 ² Animals consuming plants as food
 ² Some predators consuming other animals
 ² Certain micro-organisms depending on other living organisms
 ² Some animals use trees as their habitat
 ² Animals hiding among plants for protection
 ² Some plants use animals to spread their species
 ² Some plants fulfill their nitrogenous requirements from insects 

(insectivorous plants)

 ² Producing new creatures through reproduction for the continuous existence of 

life

Figure 12.10 - Living-living relationships

Living - non living relationships
The  interactions  between  the  living  organisms  and  non-living  components  are 
known living-non living relationships. The organisms interact with their habitat to 
get non-living components such as water, air and light.

e.g.  

The plants use solar energy for photosynthesis
Plants absorb water from soil
Plants and animals use atmospheric oxygen for respiration
Plants use atmospheric carbon dioxide for photosynthesis
Plants release oxygen  to the atmosphere as a result of photosynthesis

12.5   Natural ecosystems and built environment

Sri Lanka is a country with a rich bio-diversity. Various ecosystems are found due 
to the location of Sri Lanka as an island and the location of the central hill country. 
The location of different ecosystems is a major cause for a higher bio-diversity.

Natural aquatic environments
Natural aquatic environments can be categorized into three groups as fresh water, 
marine  ecosystems  and  brackish  water  environments.  A  vast  number  of  living 
organisms live in these environments. Information about some aquatic ecosystems 
are given below.

Rivers
 ² They are fresh water aquatic ecosystems.
 ² Most  rivers  start  from  the  catchment 
areas  of  the  central  highlands  and  flow 
to the sea.

 ² The  water  level  of  rivers  fluctuate  with 

the rainfall in the regions.

 ² Some  rivers  confine  to  a  small  stream 

during the dry season.

Figure 12.14 - A river

 ² Different species of plants and animals are living from the head wall ('Ismaththa') 

up to the estuary.    

    e.g.  'Mahaweli' river, 'Kelani' river

Importance
 ² Fulfill the water needs for agriculture
 ² Generating hydro power
 ² For transportation

Estuary
 ² A place where a river falls to the sea is 

known as an estuary.

 ² As  marine  water  and  fresh  water  are 
mixed  at  estuary,  water  becomes 
brackish.

 ² Various  organisms  live  in  brackish 

water. 

Figure 12.15 - A river mouth

 ² The  deposition  of  mud  and  sand  in 

river water cause triangular islands known as a Delta.

    e.g.  Estuary of 'Mahaweli' – opens to 'Koddiyar' Bay and 'Thambalagam' Bay

Importance
 ² Prevents the mixing of marine water and fresh water
 ² Abundance of fish species with economic importance
 ² Rich in bio-diversity

31

Lagoon
 ² A  lagoon  is  a  shallow  body  of  brackish 
water permanently separated from the sea 
by barriers of sand or reefs, but connected 
with the sea at one time during the year.
e.g.    Negombo lagoon, Batticaloa lagoon, 

Puttalam lagoon

Importance
 ² Used for fishing purposes because prawns, crabs, oysters are available in these 

Figure 12.16 - Lagoon

places

 ² The mangrove plants common on lagoons prevent sea erosion.
 ² A place of tourist attraction 

Riverine environment
 ² The environment on either sides of the river 
from  starting  point  of  the  river  to  the  point 
where  it  flows  to  the  sea  is  known  as  the 
riverine environment.

 ² Flood  plains,  sandy  lands,  marshy  lands 

belong to this environment.

 ² 'Villu' is a wet land in riverine environment.
 ² Due to over flow of a river during the rainy 

season flood plains are created.
e.g.   'Mahaweli' flood plain at East

Importance

Figure 12.17 - River side environment

 ² Used for inland fishing industry
 ² The soil is very fertile in flood plains as silt flowing along the river is deposited 
in these areas. So, this soil is used for agriculture as well as for tile and brick 
industry.

Inland water reservoirs
 ² Naturally  formed  lakes  and  ponds  belong 
to inland water reservoirs. Man-made tanks 
are also considered inland water reservoirs. 
They can be seen in both wet zone and dry 
zone and are fresh water environments.

Figure 12.18 -  Inland water reservoirs

 ² Plants  such  as  Lotus,  Lilly,  'Kekatiya'/'Kotti'  and  animals  such  as  fish,  frogs, 

snakes, otters and aquatic birds can be seen in this environment

e.g.   'Parakrama samudraya', 'Kala wewa'

 ² Used for inland fishery industry
 ² Provides water for agriculture

Ocean
 ² Marine areas that covers most  of the 
Earth’s surface is known as ocean.
 ² A  large  living  community  such  as 
algae, polyps, oysters and fish live in 
the oceans. 
e.g. - Indian ocean, Atlantic ocean

Importance
 ² Rich bio-diversity
 ² Ocean water is used to produce salt
 ² For fishing industry
 ² Generates electricity by ocean waves
 ² A place of tourist attraction

Wet lands
 ² Marshy  lands  that  are  covered  with 
water during a long period of time in 
the year are known as wet lands.

 ² There are fresh water wet lands, marine 
wet lands and man-made wet lands.
e.g. - Anawilundawa, Muthurajawela

Figure 12.19 - Ocean

 Importance
 ² Wet  lands  are  important  to  control  flood,  maintain  the  stability  of  reservoirs, 
minimize climatic changes, make ground water nutritious and maintain the bio-
diversity.

Man-made ecosystems in Sri Lanka
The man-made ecosystems in Sri Lanka can be categorized into 3 groups.  

 ² Agricultural environments
 ²
Industrial environments
 ² Settlement environments

Agricultural environments

 ² An  ecosystem  designed  for  cultivation 
of  crops  and  animal  husbandry  to 
meet  the  food  requirement  is  called  an 
agricultural environment. 

 ² Occasions  where  humans  have  taken 
into  their  control  of  certain  plants  and 
animals that were distributed in natural 
environment are found in agricultural environments.

Figure 12.30 - Agricultural environment

 ² For the cultivation of paddy, tea, vegetables particular land preparations should 
be carried out. Also lands must be allocated for animal husbandry. In this case 
when the grasslands are regularly grazed, the plants do not exist. Hence the bio-
diversity is limited.

 ” Compare and tabulate the differences between a natural environment and an 

agricultural environment.

Industrial environments

 ² An  ecosystem  that  has  been  built  up 
by  machines,  raw  materials  and  energy 
resources required for a product is called 
an industrial environment.

 ² When  a  community  is  being  developed 
many  productions 
(food,  medicine,  
clothes,  furniture,  electrical  equipment, 
sanitary  materials)  are  produced,  by  many  industries  for  betterment  of  living 
conditions of the citizens in a certain country.

Some of the adverse effects are, 

 ² Heavy noise in the industrial environment
 ² Releasing poisonous gases and smokes
 ² Release of excessive heat and contamination of water bodies
 ² Harmful chemicals, released to the environment

Settlement environments

 ² A rural or urban environment where 
man  has  established  his  habitat  is 
known as settlement environments. 
 ² Migration  to  cities  on  a  variety  of 
needs and urbanization in cities have 
resulted more urban settlements.
 ² Many  problems  have  arisen  due  to 

improper human settlements.

Summary

 ² Combination of plants, animals, micro-organisms, genetic materials of all 

these living organisms and the ecosystems is known as bio-diversity.

 ² There  are  various  threats  for  bio-diversity.  These  threats  have  led  to 

deterioration in bio-diversity.

 ² The  living  organisms  as  well  as  non-living  components  in  an  ecosystem 
often  interact  with  each  other.  These  interactions  are  living-living, 
living-non living and non living-non living.

 ² Fresh  water  environments,  marine  environments  and  brackish  water 
environments  are  the  natural  aquatic  environments  that  can  be  seen  in 
Sri  Lanka.  Rivers,  estuaries,  lagoons,  riverine  environments,  man  made 
inland water bodies and oceans belong to these environments.

 ² The natural terrestrial environments in Sri Lanka can be grouped as forests 

and grasslands.

 ² There are four types of forests in Sri Lanka. They are tropical rainforests, 
montane  forests,  tropical  dry  mixed  evergreen  forests  and  tropical  thorn 
forests.

 ² Wet 'Patana', dry 'Patana', 'Damana' and 'Talawa' are the types of grasslands 

in Sri Lanka.

 ² The  man-made  ecosystems  are  agricultural  environments,  industrial 

environments and settlement environments.
It is our responsibility to protect the bio-diversity.

From the date of the origin of Earth, everything in it has been formed naturally. 
However  with  the  advent  of  man  on  Earth  and  passage  of  time  thereafter,  an 
artificial  environment  or  a  built  environment  was  taken  place  on  the  natural 
environment because of the man who changed the natural environment according 
to his requirements. Therefore, agricultural, industrial and urban environments are 
artificial environments made by man.

has increased. Meanwhile, with the increase in human population and unlimited 
exploitation  of  limited  resources  on  Earth,  all  organisms  have  confronted  with 
many  problems.  Increase  in  global  warming  due  to  human  activities  has  either 
directly or indirectly become the reason for all environmental problems. 

At  present,  human  attention  has  been  drawn  to  follow  guidelines  and  policies 
essential  for  maintaining  goods  and  services  without  damaging  the  natural 
environment or causing minimal damage to the natural environment on the Earth. 
This has come to limelight as the green concept. 

Green concept means, following guidelines and policies essential for maintaining 
goods and services so that the natural environment on Earth is minimally harmed 
or not harmed at all. 

To get a better understanding about the green concept, let us find out information 
on several places in the world which adopt the green concept.

German Parliamentary building 

Energy  for  this  building  is  obtained 
from  solar  energy,  geothermal  energy 
and  bio-fuel  power  houses.  In  addition, 
it  has  special  ventilating  devices  and 
contrivances to retain warmth. 80% of the 
total electricity requirement is produced 
within  the  building  itself.  Because  of 
such  devices,  it  has  reduced  the  annual 
emission  of  carbon  dioxide  from  7  000 
tons to 1 000 tons (figure 13.3). 

Figure 13.3 - German Parliamentary building 

Figure 13.4 - Beijing National sports complex

Beijing National sports complex in China

It  has  employed  methods  to  obtain  electricity  from  solar  energy  and  water 
requirements  from  rain  water.  Ventilation  is  effected  naturally.  Therefore,  the 
maintenance of the sports complex is carried out by low cost (figure 13.4).  

Wayne  L.  Morse  court  complex  in 
USA

Irrigation required for plants is minimized 
by  growing  plants  which  can  withstand 
drought  conditions.  Use  of  water  has 
been cut down by 40% by the installation 
of waterless urinals, toilets and showers 
which use water minimally (figure 13.5).

K2 Housing project in Australia 

This housing complex utilizes renewable 
energy  only.  Use  of  recycled  timber, 
rain    water,  solar  water  heaters  and 
photovoltaic  panels  can  be  seen  in  this. 
By  such  measures,  it  has  been  able  to 
reduce  electrical  supply  by  55%,  water 
supply by 53% and petroleum gas supply 
by 46% (figure 13.6).

Bud Clark Commons housing complex 
in USA
This  housing  complex  uses  solar  water 
heaters  to  get  hot  water,  a  roof  with  a 
plant cover absorbing heat and rain water, 
devices  to  purify  bathroom  effluents  to 
be used in toilets and fiberglass windows 
opening under hot conditions. This project 
saves energy worth of 60 000 US dollars 
annually (figure 13.7).

You should not misunderstand that the aim of green 
concept is only enhancing the plant cover to appear 
in green. It may be quite clear to you from the above 
examples. Minimizing the emission of greenhouse 
gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide etc.) 
that cause increase in global warming is also a major 
aim of the green concept. Therefore, all processes 
supporting  it  belong  to  the  green  concept.  Let  us 
examine how the present agricultural and industrial 
processes can be geared for this.

Concept

13.2   Agricultural Process

Organic farming 

The production process that promotes the wellbeing of the agricultural environmental 
system,  microbial  activity  in  soil,  bio-diversity  and  biological  cycles  is  called  
organic farming. 

44

Use of organic fertilizers can be given as a major aspect of organic farming. As the 
harvest that flourishes by absorbing nutrients from the soil of the cultivated land is 
removed from it, the soil becomes deficient in nutrients. Therefore, the soil should 
be supplied with nutrients from outside. It is done by applying fertilizers, containing 
artificially  prepared  minerals  and  artificially  synthesized  chemicals,  which 
are being applied more and more. But, instead of this, organic fertilizers such as 
compost formed by subjecting plant or animal materials to natural processes can be 
applied. Some facts regarding the importance of the use of organic fertilizers rather 
than inorganic fertilizers can be listed as follows. 

 ² Application  of  inorganic  fertilizers  destroy  many  micro-organisms  and 
macro-organisms such as earthworms which are helpful for the crop. It affects 
existence of the natural environment badly. 

 ² Excessive  application  of  inorganic  fertilizers  affects  human  health  through 
plant products. Some heavy metals contained in, enter the human body giving 
rise to unfavourable effects. 

 ² Organic fertilizers add nutrients falling within a wide range whereas inorganic 
fertilizers  can  provide  only  a  few  nutrients  such  as  nitrogen,  phosphorus, 
potassium and sulphur.

 ² Large amount of money need not to be spent for organic fertilizers. Fertilizers 
can be produced ourselves using refuse such as straw, plant debris, chaff and 
saw dust. 

 ² There  is  a  greater  demand  for  rice,  vegetables,  fruits  and  leafy  vegetables 
obtained  from  organic  farming  among  the  discerning  people  in  Sri  Lanka. 
Therefore, the farmers growing them as well as the traders who sell them can 
have a higher income. 

 ² The  structure  of  the  soil  will  be  improved  with  the  time  by  using  organic 

fertilizer.

Another fact of organic farming is the use of traditional agricultural practices for 
pest control. The pesticides used at present are highly poisonous chemicals that are 
synthesized  artificially.  Weedicides,  insecticides  and  fungicides  belong  to  them. 
Use of these pesticides causes inestimable environmental degradation and it can be 
prevented by employing traditional agricultural practices. These may be biological 
methods,  mechanical  methods  or  religious  rituals.  Some  traditional  agricultural 
practices used for pest control are given below.  

 ² Spread other organisms that destroy eggs and larvae of pests

 ² Control pests using insect-repelling substances 

('Dahaspethiya' flowers/'Sevvandipoo',  juice of neem seeds, plants of citrus family)

 ² Water management (restrict water or excess water) to control pests

In order to protect the cultivated land from harmful insects, an oil lamp is lighted 
in the land at night. Then the insects attracted to the flame are caught by it and 
die. Hence, this is known as a light trap. 

 ² After  sowing  seed  paddy  in  a  paddy  field,  a  'diya  holmana'  is  made  below 
the  'vakkada'  (overflow)  to  protect  them  from  birds.  Because  of  the  sound  it 
produces, the birds fly away. 

 ² To protect paddy in a paddy field from mice, sticks each tied with a coconut 
husk are planted in several places in the paddy fields. Then, the birds such as 
owls perch on them and hunt the mice.

 ² Crop rotation avoid the establishment of pests in the crop land. 

Assignment 13.2

Collect  information  about  the  traditional  agricultural  practices  used  for  pest 
control either by consulting elders or electronic/print media and prepare a booklet. 

As the side effects of present day agricultural practices carried out neglecting the 
traditional  knowledge  descended  for  long  about  farming  in  Sri  Lankan  society 
and without modern scientific knowledge farmers have to face tragedies like the 
chronic kidney disease. In addition to that, diseases such as dermatitis and neuro 
diseases are common.

Water management
"Let  us  not  drain  even  a  single  drop  of  water  falling  from  the  sky  into  the  sea 
without being used" declared so in the past by king 'Parakramabahu' the Great, was 
the importance of water management. We are the one and the only nation that did an 
environment friendly water management for agriculture from the past. Tanks, dams 
and irrigation canals which give supreme contribution to sustain lives of millions 
of people from thousands of years back to date, are magnificent examples for rain 
water conservation (figure 13.9 (a)).

A  reservoir  of  water  made  by  erecting  a  dam  across  a  river,  stream  (oya)  or  a 
tributary of them with the aim of irrigating for farming an area which is short of 
water supply is used in earlier times. 

Low  level  areas  in  large  flat  areas  are  made  into  tank  systems  where  rain  water 
got stored. These tanks are connected where rain water get collected and flow into 
nearby tanks. The stored water is used in dry zones during whole year.  A tank is a 
system full of the green concept.  This is confirmed by considering the components 
of a common plan of a tank (figure 13.9 (b)). 

Collecting of rain water

As an individual person, there are courses of action which 
we can take to conserve rain water. One such measure is 
utilizing rain water falling on the roofs of houses and other 
buildings, during drought (figure 13.10).  

Drip irrigation

is 

the  most 

efficient 
This 
micro-irrigation  method 
used 
at  present.  In  this,  lateral  pipes 
connected to a main pipeline from 
the  water  source  are  laid  closer 
to  the  root  system  of  every  crop 
plant. Water drips in the form of droplets from small devices 
called emitters in these pipes. Since water seeps only to the 
root system, water is not wasted and the growth of weeds is 
controlled (figure 13.11).

Management  of  use  and  development  of  the  land  resource  is  known  as  land 
management.  

Land  provides  the  environment  for  agriculture.  But,  when  using  it  there  may  be 
favourable  as  well  as  unfavourable  impacts  on  the  environment.  Especially  the 
misuse  of  land  leads  to  collapse  of  natural  equilibrium  including  the  increase  in 
the emission of greenhouse gases. The reason for this is that if maximum use is not 
made from the existing land, lands with forests have to be used for cultivations. This 
causes deforestation, so the green cover is reduced. Therefore, land management 
should focus the green concept. 

Some steps taken in land management are given below. 

Improving the soil structure so that water and air are retained well

 ² Making a soil texture suitable for agriculture
 ²
 ² Making a good draining system in the land 
 ²
 ² Cultivated better suited crops in respective places in the land. 

Improving the quality of soil by applying fertilizers

Figure 13.12 – A managed cultivated land

Indicated  below  are  a  few  advantages  that  can  be  obtained  by  sustainable 
management of agricultural lands. 

Improving the quality of natural resources, soil and water

Improving productivity
 ² Reducing production risk
 ²
 ² Raising economic value
 ² Minimizing disasters
 ² Minimizing effects to the environment

Several green concept centered cultivation methods used in land management for 
high productivity are given in table 13.1.

Table 13.1 
 ² Mixed crop cultivation  Cultivating  one  or  more  crops  along  with  one  main 
crop in a same plot of land is referred to as mixed crop 
cultivation. This yields many advantages.

 ² Crop rotation 

 ² Growing crops 
improved by 
bio-technology

 ² Since  nutrients  are  absorbed  in  balance  from  the 

soil, the quality of soil is conserved.

 ² Since there are different types of crops, the growth 
of  weeds  and  damage  caused  by  insect  pests  are 
minimized.

 ² Crops withstand unfavourable climatic conditions 

and plant diseases are suppressed.
Increases the total yield

 ²
 ² Affords maximum benefits out of limited resources 

In  this  method,  several  crops  are  grown  in  the  same 
plot  of  land  from  season  to  season  according  to  an 
order. Mostly in crop rotation, four crops, a cereal, a 
legume, a yam crop and a commercial vegetable crop 
are grown.  

 ² By growing different types of crops, nutrients in all 

the soil layers are exploited. 

 ² Different modes of land preparation improves the 
physical,  chemical  and  biological  features  of  the 
soil.

When  improving  plants  by  bio-technology,  their 
tolerance  to  drought  and  resistance  to  diseases  and 
pests  increase  while  the  nutritive  value  and  taste  of 
plant products also increase. 

e.g.
 ² Developing  high  quality  varieties  of  organisms 

through hybridization

 ² Developing  maize  plants  resistant  to  a  harmful 

weevil species

 ² Producing  varieties  of  rice  which  are  resistant  to 

pests

 ² Producing a variety of 'Ransahal' containing vitamin 

A

 ² Making crop varieties which produce higher yield

Post-harvest technology

Cleaning,  classifying  and  packaging  the 
harvest  immediately  after  harvesting  so 
that its quality is preserved, is known as 
post-harvest  technology  (figure  13.13). 
The  post-harvest  process 
includes 
plucking the harvest, packing the harvest, 
transporting and selling. 

In  Sri  Lanka,  it  can  be  seen  that 
post-harvest technology operates at a very 
low  level.  It  seems  that,  in  our  country 
people  are  little  interested  in  plucking, 
packaging and transporting harvest scientifically. Therefore, a greater part of the 
harvest is disposed without consumption. This drops the income of the producer as 
well as the seller while increase the price of the products. Moreover, the opportunity 
to consume high quality food is reduced due to poor post harvest technology. 

Figure 13.13 – Post-harvest arrangements

13.3    Industrial process

Use of chemical substances
We have accustomed to use chemical substances for various needs of our day to day 
life. They can be indicated as follows. 

 y Food additives
 y Cleaning agents
 y Medicines
 y Disinfectants
 y Cosmetics
 y Paints

Most  of  these  chemicals  are  artificially  synthesized  substances.  Once  added  to 
the  environment  they  retain  for  a  long  time  in  the  same  form.  This  disturbs  the 
environmental  balance.  Because  of  this,  we  need  to  minimize  the  use  of  these 
chemical substances as much as possible or use natural substitutes instead of them. 
Some measures that can be taken in this regard are as follows. 

 ² Avoid the consumption of flavoured food as much as possible and use home 

prepared natural flavours such as spices instead of artificial flavours.

 ² Use chemicals such as turmeric and asafoetida which have been used by our 

ancestors to kill germs.   

 ² Using natural medicinal substances, instead of mercury containing carcinogenic 

creams available in the market to brighten the skin. 

Construction of buildings 

The aim of green building concept is to construct buildings with a green environment 
beset with plants. A few basic principles should be abided by when constructing 
green buildings. They are; 

 ² Presence of green plants in the premises
 ² Get clean air through ventilation methods such as doors and windows
 ² Minimize the amount of waste 
 ² Use energy efficiently 
 ² Consume water efficiently
 ² Use natural materials for construction 
 ² Make the maintenance cost minimal
 ² Device to reach natural light

Through the green buildings concept, environmental resources can be consumed 
causing  minimum  loss  to  the  environment.  Therefore,  maximum  benefit  can  be 
utilized from the nature. Technology also can be used for this. 

e.g.

 ² Minimizing the amount of heat by a plant cover 
 ² Producing electricity by solar cells 
 ² Obtaining hot water to bathrooms from solar heaters
 ² Fixing large windows to receive more natural light and ventilation

Green transportation  

A  massive  revolution  of  transporting  activities  has  been  taken  place  with  the 
technological development in modern world. It causes to increase the productivity, 
efficiency  and  the  comfortable  luxuries  life  pattern.  But,  unfavourable  effects 
caused  due  to  this  development  make  long  term  disadvantageous  results.  Large 
amount  of  fuels  burn  daily  for  transporting  goods  and  passengers.  The  result  is 
collecting green house gases such as CO2 and NO2 more in the atmosphere. 

Vehicles of turbo engines which combust compressed air with petrol, release more 
NO2 gas in addition to CO2. Hence, attention must be paid towards of minimizing 
the emission of greenhouse gases in transporting activities. This concept is known 
as green transportation.

e.g.  

 ² Minimizing usage of vehicles individually
 ² Using  transporting  methods  which  do  not  consume  fuels  (walking, 

cycling)

 ² Aware and facilitate citizens to use hybrid vehicles
 ² Promote the concept of vehicles using solar cells and electricity among 

public

 ² Facilitating, transporting methods through water ways such as streams 

and rivers 

When transporting food and other goods, it burns large amount of fuels that energy 
consumption  is  also  need  to  cut  down  to  decrease  food  miles.  Consumption  of 
local food is also need to appreciate. Every individual must take steps to minimize 
the emission of greenhouse gases in transporting activities so, that every body can 
contribute to solve global crises. 

Assignment 13.3

Make a list of activities that you can engage for green transportation. 
Get the ideas and proposals of your friends in classroom, by presenting the list 
you prepare. 

The  above  discussion  reveals  us  that,  man  has  changed  his  living  environment 
drastically for his luxurious life by exploitation of limited resources unlimitedly. 
Other organisms on the Earth has no privilege to use environmental resources as 
human population, although they live in the same land.

Number  of  global  issues  has  been  arisen  from  unusual  exploitation  of  natural 
resources  by  some  people.  The  serious  threaten  is  global  warming.  Hence,  it  is 
the  responsibility  of  man  to  avoid  every  activity  which  causes  the  emission  of 
greenhouse gases. 

From birth to death, every activity of man cause producing CO2. It can be inferred 
that, there is no human activity which do not cause production of CO2. This can be 
clearly understood by studying 'Carbon footprint' of an individual. 

It  states  us  the  amount  of  CO2 (metric  tons)  emitted  by  an  individual.  Through 
out a year, a large amount of carbon is being released by people during activities 
like  taking  food,  drinking,  clothing  and  occupation.  Agricultural  activities  and 
transportation related with 'Food mile' is again related with transporting activities. 
Another major issue caused due to shortage of drinking water can be explained, 
by the concept of  'Water footprint'. You will learn more details about food mile, 
carbon footprint and water footprint in grade 11.

For extra knowledge 

Carbon footprint

The amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere within a given time 
period  as  a  result  of  the  activities  of    a  particular  individual,  a  production,  an 
activity or an organization is a carbon foot print. Total carbon foot print cannot 
be  calculated  precisely  as  CO2 is  produced  naturally  and  it  needs  more  data  to 
calculate.

Water footprint

The amount of fresh water utilized in the production or supply of the goods and 
services used by a particular person or group.

Food mile

The distance over which a food item is transported during the journey from producer 
to consumer, is known as food mile. This depends according to the amount of food 
consume per meal and the location where the food is produced.

Reflection and 
Refraction of Waves

14.1   Reflection of light
Light  is a very important form of energy for man. Let us briefly recall what we 
have learnt about light in grades 6 and 7. Let us do the assignment 14.1 for this. 

Assignment 14.1

 ² According  to  the  activities  in  table  14.1  what  are  the  conclusions  you  can 

made regarding the characteristics of light. 

Table 14.1

Plane mirror      

Light is composed of very thin light rays which travel in straight lines. Light travels 
through  a  vacuum  or  a  transparent  medium  in  straight  lines,  and  reflects  when 
strikes on a reflecting surface (mirror).

Bouncing back of light ray into the same medium, when strikes on a surface, is 
known as reflection of light.

Let us study further about the reflection of light. 

14.1.1   Reflection of light by a plane mirror 
Let us do the activity 14.1 to study how light rays get reflected from a plane mirror.  

Activity 14.1

You will need :- A plane mirror, a sheet of white paper, an electrical torch or a 

laser torch, a pair of scissors, a ruler, a protractor, a pencil 

Method :-
 ² Place the sheet of white paper on the table
 ² Place the plane mirror perpendicular to the paper using a stand.
 ² Draw the mirror line on the paper 
 ² Direct a narrow inclined beam of light, along the paper on to the mirror using 

the electrical torch or the laser torch.

 ² Observe how the beam of light reflects from the mirror 
 ² Trace the incident and reflected rays on the paper using the pencil
 ² Remove the mirror and complete the rays using the ruler 
 ² Construct the normal line to the plane mirror at the point of incidence 
 ² Measure the angles at either sides of the normal line

A diagram that shows the way the rays are traveling is known as a ray diagram.

In the activity 14.1, what you have constructed is a ray diagram to show the reflection 
of  a light ray from a plane mirror after its incidence. 

 ² The ray that falls on the mirror is called the incident ray.
 ² The  point  where  the  incident  ray  contacts  with  the  mirror  is  the  point  of 

incidence.

 ² The ray that reflects away from the mirror is known as the reflecting ray.
 ² The  perpendicular  line  drawn  to  the  mirror  at  the  point  of  incidence  is  the 

normal or the normal line. 

 ² The angle between the incident ray and the normal line is called the angle of 
incidence and the angle between the reflected ray and the normal line is called 
the angle of reflection. 

We can do the activity 14.1 using pins instead of using electrical torch. Let us do 
the activity 14.2 by using pins.

Activity 14.2

You will need :- A sheet of white paper, A plane mirror, four pins, a ruler, a pencil, 

a protractor, a stand 

Method :- 
 ² Place the sheet of paper on the table
 ² Place the plane mirror perpendicular to the paper using the stand
 ² Draw the mirror line on the paper
 ² Fix  two  pins  in  front  of  the  plane  mirror  which  should  be  on  an  inclined 

straight line to the mirror.

 ² Observe the images of the pins through the mirror 
 ² Fix another two pins on the paper, which are in line with the two images.
 ² Now remove the pins and the mirror. Draw straight lines connecting the pin 
marks. Complete the ray diagram by constructing the normal line at the point 
if incidence, as done in activity 14.1

 ² Measure the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection.

14.1.2    Laws of reflection

Observations  of  the  activities  14.1 
and  14.2  can  be  summarized  as 
follows.
 ² When light is reflecting; that the 
incident  ray,  reflecting  ray  and 
the  normal  line  are  in  the  same 
plane. 

 ² That  the  values  of  the  angle 
of  incidence  and  the  angle  of 
reflection are equal.

Point of incidence

Angle of 
incidence

Angle of 
reflection

Incident ray

Above  conclusions  are  true  for  all 
the instances of reflection of light. Therefore, they are considered as the laws of 
reflection. There are two laws of reflection. 

Figure 14.3

1.  The incident ray, the reflecting ray and the normal line drawn at the point of 

incidence are in the same plane.

2.  The  value  of  the  angle  of  incidence  is  equal  to  the  value  of  the  angle  of 

reflection.   

14.1.3   Regular reflection and diffuse reflection

Let us observe how parallel rays of light are reflected from a smooth surface and a 
rough surface. Let us do the activity 14.3, using a plane mirror as a smooth reflecting 
surface and a crushed aluminium foil as a rough reflecting surface. 

Activity 14.3

You will need :- An electrical torch or a laser torch, A plane mirror , an aluminium 

foil, a joss stick 

Method:- 
 ² Aim a beam of light on to the plane mirror and the crushed aluminium foil 

separately as shown in the figure 14.4

 ² Observe how the light is reflecting in each instance
 ² Discuss your observations in the class room

(For clear observation, spread some smoke near the set-up using the joss stick)

You  may  have  observed  that  parallel  light  rays  are  reflected  parallelly  by  plane 
mirror (figure 14.4 a) and parallel light rays are reflected to various directions by 
crushed aluminium foil (figure 14.4 b). 

According to the activity 14.4, it is clear that light reflection is of two types. 

1. Regular reflection 

2. Diffuse reflection

More information of these two types are given in the table 14.2.

 ² Regular reflection is commonly found, when using mirrors

e.g. To watch ones own face, to use light microscope 

 ² To create vivid light patterns in various shows.

 ² To get information of the motion of machine parts in industrial plants

 ² Discuss in the classroom, the instances where regular reflection and diffuse 

reflection are useful. Tabulate the facts you discussed. 

14.1.4   Images formed by plane mirrors

Images  are  formed  because  of  the  reflection  of  light,  emitted  by  objects,  from  a 
plane  mirror.  For  instance,  the  image  of  an  electrical  torch  place  before  a  plane 
mirror can be seen through it.   

Let us do the activity 14.4 to study how an image is formed by reflection of light. 

Activity 14.4

You will need :-   A  cardboard  box, 
an electrical torch, 
plane  mirror,  a 
stand,  piece  of 
cardboard,  a  pair 
of  scissors,  white 
paper

Method:-  
 ² Place the white paper on the table.
 ² Fix the plane mirror, perpendicular to the white paper. 
 ² Place  the  lighted  torch  inside  the  box,  with  a  long  slit.  Focus  the  beam  of 

Figure 14.9

light, to the slanted mirror plane, emitted by torch.

 ² Look at the reflected beam of light.
 ² What can you observe through the plane mirror.
 ² Get the help of teacher to explain your observation. 

In this activity you observed, the image of lighted slit. The light reach to eye from 
object (slit) which get reflected from the mirror. 
We see as the light reaches to eye from a point behind the mirror. It is known as 
image.

Let us draw the ray diagram for the image formed by plane mirror. 

Two rays are enough for drawing a ray diagram.

Let us do the activity 14.5 to draw a ray diagram of an image of pointy object, kept 
infront of a plane mirror.

Activity 14.5

You will need :-  Two laser beams, a white paper, a plane mirror, a stand, a pair  

of scissors

Method :-  
 ² Make a slit in the piece of cardboard
 ² Place the white paper on the table and fix the mirror to the stand perpendicularly 

(figure 14.10)

 ² Direct two lazer beams through the slit, slantly to the mirror.
 ² Observe the reflected beams of light. 
      What can you observe now?

Figure 14.10

In the activity 14.5, the pointy object is the slit made in cardboard. The light rays 
reach  from  slit,  get  reflected  by  the  plane  mirror  and  from  an  object  behind  the 
mirror. 

According to the observation done in activity 14.5 we can illustrate the ray diagram. 
For that let us engage in activity 14.6.

 ² Starting from this point, draw two inclined light rays to the mirror plane. 
 ² Mark the points of incidence and construct the normal lines for the two rays  

drawn. 

 ² Measure the angles of incidence and mark the angles of reflection equals to  

them.

 ² Now construct the reflecting rays.
 ² Extend back the reflecting rays by dotted lines to meet them together.
 ² Mark the point where the reflected rays meet together when extended back.  

That is the point where the image is formed.

Activity 14.8

You will need :- 
A  small  mechanical  clock  or  a  stop 
watch, two pieces of PVC tubes to the 
length  of  30cm  each  (dia.2.5cm),  two 
stands, a piece of cardboard to the size

 ² Place the metal or glass sheet vertically on the table.

 ² Place the cardboard sheet perpendicular to it.

 ² Fix the PVC tube to a stand as shown in figure 14.21 and place the stop watch 

closer to one end of it.

 ² Aim the other PVC tube to the glass sheet from the other side of the cardboard 
sheet. Adjust the position of the tube till a clear "tick" sound is heard through 
it. Mark the position of the tubes on the table.

 ² Now remove the glass sheet and listen for the "tick" sound of the watch.

 ² Repeat  the  activity,  changing  the  position  of  the  watch  and  using  suitable 

sound sources instead of clock or stopwatch.

 ² Discuss in the classroom, the conclusions that can be made for the activity.
 ² Think of the reason for placing a cardboard sheet between the PVC tubes.
 ² What  is  the  conclusion  that  can  be  made  according  to  the  results  of  this 

activity?

It is observed that the sound generated by the source was listened clearly at a certain 
point when the metals or glass sheet was there. And the sound could not be heard 
when the glass sheet was removed. The reason for this is the reflection of sound 
from the metal or glass sheet. 

Bouncing back of sound from an obstacle is known as reflection of sound.

The obstacle that reflected sound, in the activity 14.8 was the metal or glass sheet.  

Sound  is  in  the  environment  are  constantly  subjected  to  reflection  by  various 
obstacles. Most of the sound reflecting instances cannot be noticed. But, there are 
some observable instances. Now let us consider some of them.

14.2.2    Echo

You may have observed that, when a strong sound is made in front of a large obstacle 
(a mountain/a building), it is heard over and over again. Let us do the activity 14.9 
to experience this.  

Activity 14.9

You will need :- A clapper used for starting running events or two wooden sticks

Method :-  
 ² Select  a  place  where  there  is  a 
suitable obstacle like a  tall building 
or a wall.

 ² Stand  about  17  m  apart  from  the 
obstacle (minimum distance between 
the obstacle and the observer to hear 
an echo is 16.5 m).

 ² Make  strong  sounds  by  striking  the 

clapper several times.

Observer

Figure 14.22

 ² Listen carefully after each instance of making the sound.
 ² Discuss the reasons for observations.
 ² Repeat the activity while coming closer to the obstacle.
 ² Make the sound while you are at a distance of 15 m or less to the obstacle (you 

can use even the walls of your classroom for this).
 ² Compare the latter observations with the earlier ones. 

Sound generates by the clapper, was reflected by the obstacle. After hearing the first 
sound, the reflected sound was also heard after a short while later. 

A second hearing because of the reflection of sound after the first one, is known 
as echo. 

When the obstacle is too close the echo is not clear. This fact is confirmed in activity 
14.9.

Sometimes  several    echoes  can  be  heard,  because  of  the  reflection  of  the  first 
sound. This happens when the sound is reflected several times. For instance, sound 
reflection in an auditorium can be mentioned.

Assignment 14.5

 ² List out the instances of sound reflection that you have experienced in your 
day-to-day life. Mentioned the obstacle that is responsible for the reflection 
of sound in each instance. 

For extra knowledge 

Though the sound is reflected, clear 
echo is not heard when the obstacle 
is too close to the observer. 

There is a minimum distance that 
should be maintained between the 
obstacle  and  observer  to  hear  an 
echo. That minimum distance can 
be calculated as given below. 

 ² The sense of sound is retained in human ear for 0.1 seconds.
 ² Sound travels 330 meters per second in air.
 ² To distinguish two sounds separately, difference between them should be more 

than 0.1 seconds.

14.2.3   Reverberation
There are some instance in an auditorium or a cinema hall, that the sound emitted 
by the loud speaker is not clear. The reason for this is that the echo generated by 
the reflection of sound is heard before the initial sound fades off from the ear. Final 
result of this is, that the observe experiences a mixed unclear sound. 

The persistence of sound for a long time because of the disability to distinguish 
the original sound and the echo is known as reverberation. 

Reverberation is  a  disturbance  for  clear  hearing. Therefore,  methods  are  used  to 
prevent the reflection of sound in auditoria, lecture halls and cinema halls where 
clear hearing is expected. 

Reverberation occur because of the reflection of sound. Reflection of sound can be 
minimized by making the surfaces that sound strikes, to absorb it. Thus reverberation 
can be prevented. 

Following methods are used in places like cinema halls, auditoriums and studios to 
absorb sound and thus prevent reverberation (figure 14.23). 

Methods used to prevent reverberation 

Making the walls rough 

Making the ceilings porous

Figure 14.23 - Methods used to prevent reverberation 

Instance where reflection of sound is applied usefully

Let us consider briefly some instances where reflection of sound is used. 

1. Ultra sound scanning

Reflection  of  ultra  sound  waves  is  used  to  observe  the  shape  of  internal  organs. 
This method is known as ultrasound scanning. Ultra sound waves are generated by 
a machine and are aimed at the relevant organ from outside of the body. Ultrasound 
waves  that  reflect  from  the  organ  are  received  by  the  machine.  Those  waves 
formulate the external appearance of the relevant organ on a screen.

For extra knowledge 

X-ray photographing may be harmful to organs and living body. But the harm is 
very less in ultrasound scanning. 

2. Finding the depth of ocean bed

It  is  important  to  know  the  depth  of  the  ocean  bed  in  navigation.  Reflection  of 
ultrasound  waves  is  used  for  this  purpose. The  method  used  is  known  as  Sound 
Navigation and Ranging (SONAR). The equipment used for this is known Echo 
Sounder.

3. For bats, to identify obstacles at night 

Reflection  of  ultrasound  waves  helps  nocturnal 
animals  like  bats  to  identify  obstacles  at  night. 
Ultrasound waves emitted by them, reflect after 
bouncing on the obstacles. According to the time 
taken for this, they can determine the distance to 
the obstacle.

When light is travelling through a transparent medium, it travels rectilinearly. Now 
let us consider an instance that a light ray entering from one transparent medium 
to  another  transparent  medium.  Let  us  do  the  activity  14.10  for  studying  this 
phenomenon. 

Activity 14.10

You will need :- A beaker of water, some soap, an electrical torch or a laser torch

Method : - 
 ² Mix some soap in water in the beaker. (without allowing to form lather)
 ² Direct a thin inclined beam of light using the electrical torch or laser torch.

with an inclination to the water surface

 ² Carryout the activity changing the inclination of the thin beam of light
 ² Discuss your observations in the classroom.
 ² Answer the following questions while engaging in the activity.

1.  What  are  the  two  transparent  media  that  the  thin  beam  of  light  travelled 

through?

2.  At what place did the beam of light bend?
3.  What is the reason for mixing soap into water?
4.  What happens when light is directed perpendicular to the water surface?

In the activity 14.10, light rays have traveled from one transparent medium (air) 
into another transparent medium (water). The surface where two media come to 
contact each other is known as the interface. Light travels from one medium into 
another medium through the interface. It may be clear that, always the change of 
direction of light occurs at the interface. 

It is important to mix soap into water to see the beam of light in water.

The change of direction of light when traveling from one transparent medium 
into another transparent medium is known as refraction of light. 

The beam of light directed perpendicular to the interface, do not occur refraction.

 ² During refraction, the ray that is reaching the interface is the incident ray.
 ² The ray that travels after refraction is the refracted ray.
 ² The point on the interface where the incident ray falls, is the point of incidence.
 ² A normal line also can be constructed at the point of incidence.

The  way  of  refraction  occurs  when  a 
light ray enters from air to water can be 
shown  by  a  ray  diagram  as  in  figure 
14.31.

For extra knowledge

Light travels in a definite velocity in a given medium. Velocity of light differs 
from medium to medium.

Velocity of light (meters per second)

Refraction of light occurs because of change of its velocity when traveling from 
one medium to another medium. 

Refraction of light in a glass block

Let us study how a narrow beam of light (a pencil of light) refracts when directed 
into a glass block. Let us do the activity 14.11 for this. 

Activity 14.11

You will need :- A glass block, a sheet of white paper, four pins, an electrical 

torch or a laser torch, a pencil, a ruler

Method :- 
 ² Spread the sheet of white paper on the table and place the glass block on it.
 ² Direct an inclined beam of light on to the glass block as shown in figure 14.32.
 ² Fix two pins on the path of incident ray and the other two pins on the path of 

the light ray that travels away from the block. 
 ² Sketch the position of glass block using the pencil

14.3.1   Effects of refraction of light

Let us consider briefly, some phenomena that can be seen in day-to-day life, due to 
refraction of light. 

 ² Apparent elevation of the bottom of a pond or a container of water

Activity 14.12

You will need :- A tall glass tumbler or a beaker, water, a coin or a nail, a pencil

Method :- 
 ² Put the coin or the nail into the glass 
tumbler  or  the  beaker.  Fill  it  with 
water.

 ² Observe  the  coin  or  the  nail  from 

above.

 ² Mark the apparent bottom (the coin 
or the nail) When viewed from top, 
on  the  side  of  the  vessel  using  the 
pencil.

 ² Now measure the real depth and the 
apparent depth to the bottom  of the 
vessel and note them down.

It is clear that the observable depth or the apparent depth when viewed from top, is 
always less than the real depth from the water surface to the bottom. 

It  is  important  to  think  carefully  before  step  down  into  a  well  or  a  reservoir 
because the real depth of it is more than the apparent depth. 

For extra knowledge

A pencil which is partially dipped in water, seems 
to  be  broken  at  the  liquid  surface,  when  viewed

 ² Refraction of white light through a prism

A  wonderful  occurrence  can  be  observed  when

A spectrum of seven colours can be seen on the screen during the activity 14.13. 
Separation of white light into seven colours when passing through a prism due to 
refraction is the reason for this. Colours  of the spectrum are red, orange, yellow, 
green, blue, indigo and violet respectively. 

Separation of white light when passing through a prism is known as dispersion.

 ² Occurrence of rainbow  

Rainbow  is  another  elegant  phenomenon  that  occurs  due  to  refraction  of  light. 
There are various folktales among people that in connection with the rainbow. 

When  there  is  bright  sunlight  with  mist  or  drizzle,  a  rainbow  can  be  frequently 
observed. Rainbow occurs because of refraction and internal refraction of sunlight 
by water droplets in the sky. Here white sunlight is dissociated into colours by water 
droplets. A large number of water droplets in the sky contribute to form a rainbow.

Images formed by plane mirrors are always upright, virtual and are subjected 
to lateral inversion. 

 ² When images are formed by objects in front of plane mirrors, the size of the 
object is equal to the size of the image. Distance to the object is equal to the 
distance to the image.

Instances of reflecting light by plane mirrors are used in day-to-day life.
 ² Bouncing back of sound by an obstacle is called the reflection of sound
 ² Echo  and  reverberation  can  be  mentioned  as  two  phenomena  occurred  by 

reflection of sound.

Simple Machines

Since ancient time, man used machines to make their jobs easy. Let us recall some 
instances where simple machines are used.  

As  you  know,  it  is  difficult  to  lift  and 
remove a large log or a rock with hands. 
You  may  have  experienced  in  your 
day-to-day life, that one end of a metal 
rod is kept under the rock or the log and 
pushed  down  from  the  other  rod.  This 
mechanical  device  is  known  as  a  lever 
(Figure 15.1). 

Can a single person lift a barrel of oil on 
to the deck of a lorry? It is difficult. Let us find out the amount of force that has to 
be applied to lift an object directly upwards.

Figure 15.1 – A lever

Hang a piece of metal on a spring balance and take the reading. Then lift the piece 
of metal vertically up with your hand, while it is on the spring balance and observe 
the reading of the balance.  

When the piece of the metal was hanging on the balance, a force which is equal to 
the weight of the piece of metal is exerted 
downwards on the balance. While you are 
lifting the piece of metal, you are applying 
a force, which is equal to the weight of it, 
upwards. Then, you will observe that the 
reading of the balance reaches zero. Thus, 
it  is  clear  that  a  force  which  is  equal  to 
the weight of an object should be applied 
upwards to lift it vertically up. 

Figure 15.2 – Drawing an object along an 
inclined plane

Now keep a piece of long plank, inclined to the horizontal surface and draw the 
same piece of metals along it, as shown in the figure 15.2. Observe the reading of 
the spring balance. You will realize that the force exerted to draw the piece of metal 
along the ramp is less than the force exerted to lift it directly upwards. Here the job 
is made easy.

Here the device used to lift the piece of 
metal is known as inclined plane. When 
a barrel of oil is to be loaded to a lorry, it 
is easy to push it along a ramp as shown 
in the figure 15.3. 

Figure 15.3 – Loading a barrel of oil to a lorry 
using an inclined plane

When you want to pull a bucket of water from a well, 
you  can  tie  one  end  of  a  rope  to  the  bucket,  send  the 
bucket  into  the  well  and  draw  it  upwards  by  pulling 
it  from  the  other  end  of  the  rope.  Here  the  force  that 
should be applied is equal to the weight of the bucket 
full of water.  

Let  us  consider  an  easier  way  to  do  this  job.  Lifting 
the bucket of water can be easily done by sending the 
rope  round  a  pulley  and  drawing  the  other  end  of  the 
rope downwards, as shown in the figure 15.4. Drawing 
sometimes down is easier than drawing it up. Pulley is 
used to change the direction of force as we want. 

Figure 15.4 – Lifting an object 
using a pulley

To sink a screw nail into something, the force is applied 
by turning the handle of screw driver (figure 15.5). It 
is common experience that this job is made easier by 
the screw driver. Here the device used is known as the 
wheel and axle. 

Figure 15.5 – Using a screw driver

Strategies used to make the job easy are known as simple machines.

There are four types of simple machines;

Inclined plane

 ² Lever
 ²
 ² Pulley
 ² Wheel and axle

Let us discuss about these simple machines, in detail.

15.1   Lever

As we have discussed  earlier,  a metal rod or  a 
crowbar  can  be  used  to  lift  a  wooden  log  or  a 
rock. Let us consider it again.  

It is difficult to lift the rock to some height. The 
force that should be applied to do it is very large, 
that a single person cannot do it. 

Figure 15.6 – Using a crowbar

It is easy to lift the rock or the log by using a crowbar as a lever (figure 15.6).  

Here, why did the lever make the job easy? Let us do the activity 15.1 to find out about 
this.

Activity   15.1

You will need :- A book, a Newton spring 
ruler  or  a 

balance,  a 
wooden strip

Method :-
 ● Weigh the book, using the Newton spring 

balance. 

a

x

P

 ● Keep the wooden strip on a piece of wood 

Figure 15.7 

as a support P to balance it.

 ● Place  the  book  on  the  end  of  the  strip  as  shown  in  figure  15.7.  Couple  the 
Newton balance to the other end of the strip using a book and pull the balance 
vertically downwards, holding its stem.

 ● Take the reading of the balance.
 ● Keep the distance from the book to the support a constant and take several 
readings  by  changing  the  distance  from  the  support  to  the  place  where  the 
balance x is coupled. (Take several readings by keeping the value of  greater 
than a and less than a). 

 ● In each situation, observe the movement of the place attached to the wooden 

strip when the book lifts a vertical distance comparatively.

 ● Measure the distance x and keep records.

You may have observed that the force necessary to lift the book is less than the weight 
of the book when x is greater than a. Here the lever helps to ease the job. When x is 
smaller than a, the force necessary to lift the book is greater than the weight of the 
book. But, in this case the book moves further than the point where balance is attached 
moves. This distance is advantageous in some instances.

In all the above instances, the force applied on the lever is downwards to lift the 
book upwards. This change of direction of force is also another advantage of a lever.

Parts of a lever

Let us consider the activity 15.1. 

Here, the wooden strip is used as a lever. The force applied on the lever downwards 
is known as the effort. The lever lifts the weight of the book. Thus weight lifted by 
the lever is load.  

Load is balanced by the effort other the wooden support. The point of the wooden 
strip that contact with the lever is called fulcrum. 

Here we have considered three points of a lever. Load is at one end of the lever. 
Effort is at the other end. Load is balanced by the effort over the fulcrum.

Let  us  consider  the  lever  shown  in  the  figure  15.8 AB  is  a  metal  rod.  Effort  is 
applied downwards at B.  Rod is balanced on C. So, C is the fulcrum.

Effort arm and load arm
The part of the lever from effort 
to  fulcrum  (CB)  is  known  as 
effort arm. The part of the lever 
from  load  to  the  fulcrum  (CA) 
is known as load arm.

Mechanical advantage  
Mostly a large load can be balanced by applying a small effort on a machine. In the 
above activity, when the length of effort arm (x) is greater than that of load arm (a), 
the book could be lifted by applying a force less than the weight of the book. This 
advantage of the machine is calculated as the ratio of load to effort. This ratio is 
known as mechanical advantage. 

Mechanical Advantage

=

Load
Effort

According to the figure 15.8, if a load of 36 N is lifted by applying an effort of 12 N, 
then the mechanical advantage is;

To remove the lid of a tin can, you can lift it with your fingers. But, it is difficult. An 
easier way is shown in figure 15.9.
Here  the  handle  of  a  spoon  is  used  as  a 
lever.  One  end  of  the  handle  of  spoon 
holds the lid of tin (load). One point of the 
handle  rests  on  the  edge  of  tin  can.  This 
point  is  the  fulcrum.  When  a  small  force 
(effort) is applied at the free end and of the 
handle, the lid is thrown up. So, the load of the can is removed easily.

Figure 15.9

Consider the position of the fulcrum of the levers mentioned above. It is positional 
between the effort and the load.      

Let us consider following situation where effort arm is greater than load arm.  

Thus, levers can be divided into three orders according to the positions of effort, 
load and fulcrum. 

 ² First order lever
 ² Second order lever 
 ² Third order lever

First order levers

Levers,  in  which  the  fulcrum  acts  between  load  and  effort  are  called  first  order 
levers. All the levers we considered in this lesson, up to now, are first order levers. 
Figure below shows a first order lever.

Second order levers
Levers in which the load acts between effort and fulcrum are referred to as second 
order levers. Nut cracker is an example.

Some examples for second order levers are given in figure 15.13.

Figure 15.13 – Second order levers

Wheelbarrow

The blade and the rod  of  the nut cracker turns  round  the pin, by  which  they are 
coupled. Therefore, that pin is the fulcrum. Load acts on the object that is to be cut. 
Effort is applied at the far end of the handle.  

Third order levers
In third order levers, effort acts between the load and the fulcrum (figure 15.14). 
Broom, fishing rod (figure 15.15) and human arm are some examples for third order 
levers. 

Effort

Fulcrum

Figure 15.14

Load

Load arm is always longer than the effort arm in third 
order levers. Therefore, an effort which is greater than 
the load has to be applied to balance that rod. Thus, the 
mechanical  advantage  is  always  less  than  one.  But, 
these  levers  are  advantageous  because  load  moves 
more for a small motion of the effort.

Velocity ratio of  a lever 
Let us consider the lever device used to high a load up.

X Effort

Effort is applied on the point B of this lever. Let the point B travels to point X, 
which is the displacement of effort. Sometimes load is lifted from A to Y. Therefore, 
A Y is the displacement of load. 

Velocity  ratio  of  a  machine  is  the  ratio  of  the  displacement  of  effort  to  the 
displacement of load during the same time.

Velocity ratio =

Displacement of effort
Displacement of load 

According to mathematics, same value can be obtained by dividing the length of 
effort arm by the length of load arm. 

The  larger  the  velocity  ratio  of  a  machine  the  smaller  the  effort  that  should  be 
applied on it. 

If BX =  60 cm  and AY =  15 cm  in the above example, 

The velocity ratio of that lever =

=

60 cm
15 cm
4

If  a  velocity  ratio  of  a  machine  is  4,  then  theoretically,  the  effort  that  should  be 
applied to lift a load using that machine is 1/4 th of the load. 

But, in practice the effort does not decrease down that much (1/4th of the load). The 
reason for this is the friction in the  system. Thus  the  mechanical advantage of a 
machine is always less than its velocity ratio.

Work-input and work-output 

When we have to get work done from a machine, we have to work on the machine. 
Work done on the machine is called work-input. When the work input is given to 
the machine, some amount of work is done by the machine also. That is known as 
work-output.  
Let us consider the lever that we mentioned above.
Let the effort at B is 50 N and the load lifted at A is 150 N.
You already know, how to calculate the work done, when a force is acting along a 
certain distance.

Work done is the product of the force applied and the distance that the force travelled.

We can calculate the work done on the lever (work input) as follows.    

Work done on the lever  (work input) = effort × displacement of effort

= 50 N × 60 cm

60 
100

m

= 50 N × 

= 30 J

We can calculate the work done by the lever (work-output) as follows.

Work done by the lever (work output) = load × displacement of load

= 150 N × 15 cm

15
100

m

= 150 N ×

= 22.5 J

Here, when 30 J of work is done on the machine, only 22.5 J of work is given out 
from the machine.

Therefore, the percentage of the work given out from the machine is for the work-input.

=

22.5 J
30 J
= 75 %

× 100 

What we calculated here is the efficiency of the machine. It is 75%.

We  can  obtain  velocity  ratio  by  dividing  the  distance  travelled  by  effort  to  the 
distance travelled by load. But, here it says other way around. It is similar to the

This is;

Inclined plane or a ramp  can be used to make a job easy. Therefore, inclined plane 

We realized earlier, that a force equal to the weight of an object should be applied 

But less effort is enough to draw it along an inclined plane.

Let us do activity 15.2 to understand how effort that should be applied to draw an 

object along an inclined plane, changes with its inclination.

15.3   Wheel and axle

Wheel and axle is a simple machine which can be used to make a job easy. As wheel 

and axle are connected, force applied on the wheel can be transferred to axle to do 

the job. Windlass, is such a machine with wheel and axle. 

This  windlass  is  made  by  fixing  an  L  shaped  handle  to  a  long  cylindrical  stem, 

which is rested on the stands, so that it can be freely turned (figure 15.18).

is 2r1. Then, its circumference is  2r1×π  (π =     )22

Therefore, the distance that effort travels for one turn of the handle is 2πr1
If the radius of the cylindrical stem is r2, then its diameter is 2r2.

15.4   Pulleys

It is mentioned earlier is this lesson, that it is easier to pull a 
bucket of water from a well using a pulley rather than pulling 
the bucketful of water directly with a rope. Thus you know 
that pulley is a simple machine. 

Let us do activity 15.3 to compare the force that should be 
applied in the two situations above. 

Effort

Load

Figure 15.22 - Pulley as a 
simple machine

Activity 15.3

You will need :-  A pulley, a suitable string, 
a Newton spring balance, a 
piece of stone or a suitable 
load

Method :-                                       
 ² Measure  the  weight  of  stone  using  the 

Newton spring balance. 

 ² Now tie the string to the stone and pull it 
over the pulley using the Newton spring 
balance  as  shown  in  the  figure  15.23. 
Note down the reading of the balance.

Figure 15.23

Compare the weight of the stone and the force necessary to pull it over the pulley. 
You will realize that both readings are more or less the same. (There may be a slight 
difference due to the friction of the pulley)

When  we  are  lifting  something  straight  upwards,  the  force  should  be  applied 
upwards. However, when we are using a pulley for this purpose, the pulling force 
can be turned appropriately. Applying a force downwards is easier than applying it 
upwards. Therefore, it is easy to use a single pulley to lift a load.

Let us solve a simple problem associated with the simple machine, pulley.  

The weight of a bucketful of water is 12 N. It is lifted up using a pulley (Assume 
that the pulley has no friction.)

ii.  Velocity ratio

When the effort travels same distance, load also travels the same distance.  
Therefore, velocity ratio is 1. 

iii.  Let us see the work-input for the machine.

The work-input for the machine = Effort × distance travelled by effort

Let us take the distance travelled by the effort as 0.8 m.

Then, work-input = 12 N × 0.8 m

= 9.6 J

iv.  Let us see the work-output of the machine

Work-output of the pulley  = Load × distance travelled by load

= 12 N × 0.8 m
= 9.6 J

Pulley systems

The motion of a pulley used to draw water from a well 
is turning round its axis only. Such pulleys are known 
as  stationary  pulleys.  Other  than  these,  there  are 
pulley systems with moving pulleys.

The figure 15.24 shows a pulley system with a stationary 
pulley and a moving pulley. 

Here the force is exerted upwards by two strings on the 
moving pulley. Therefore, one string has to apply only 
a force which is equal to a half of the load. That force 
is directed downwards by the string running over the 
stationary pulley. Therefore, the mechanical advantage 
of this pulley system is 2. This mechanical advantage 
is gained only because of the moving pulley. The task 
of the stationary pulley is the change of direction of the 
force applied.

Figure 15.24

In  any  simple  machine,  velocity  ratio  increases  with  the  increase  of  mechanical 
advantage. In the above pulley system, when the effort travels down with the string 
a certain distance, load travels only a half of that distance. Therefore, its velocity 
ratio is 2. 

Mechanical advantage of a pulley system can be increased largely by using several 
stationary and moving pulleys. Crane is a complete machine that consists of pulley 
systems.

16.1   Nanometer

What is ‘NANO’?

The  word  ‘nano’  is  derived  from  Greek  language,  with  the  meaning  dwarf. 
Therefore, nano refers to something very small. At this magic scale you'd not only 
see the atoms that everything is made from—you'd actually be able to move them 
around.

How small is ‘NANO’?

It is a tiny world. It is quite hard to imagine a world that is small to see. We live on 
a scale of meters and kilometers. Nano means "billionth", so a nanometer is one 
billionth of a meter, i.e. 10-9 m. 

A two-meter-tall 
man is two billion 
nanometers tall

A pinhead size 
freckle is one million 
nanometers across

1 meter = 1 billion nanometers

How small 
is 'Nano' ?

1 millimeter = 1 million nanometers

Biological cells, such 
as these red blood 
cells, are about 10, 000 
nanometers across

DNA molecules are about 
2.5 nanometers wide

1 micrometer = 1, 000 nanometers

1 nanometer

Figure 16.3 - Nano technology refers to inventions on the scale of small molecules or individual atoms

Individual atoms such as hydrogen, are only a few tenths of a nanometer in diameter.

16.2   Nanotechnology
Nanoscale  science  investigates  the  matter  at  the  critical  range  on  1  -  100  nm. 
Making new things on this incredibly small scale is called nanotechnology and it's 
one of the most exciting and fast-moving areas of science and technology today. 
Nanotechnology  is  an  enabling  technology  which  has  applications  in  a  diverse 
areas from biology to aerospace. 

History of nanotechnology

Nanoscience and technology are not new concepts to the nature. There are many 
natural  phenomena  based  on  nanotechnology.  However,  the American  physicist 
Richard  Feynman  (1918–1988)  is  credited  with  kick-starting  modern  interest  in 
nanotechnology. In 1959, in his after-dinner speech called "There's plenty of room 
at the bottom," Feynman speculated about an public speaking incredibly tiny world 
where  people  could  use  atoms  and  molecules  as  tools  to  make  things.  In  1974, 
Japanese engineering professor Norio Taniguchi named this field "nanotechnology."

Nanotechnology truly took off in the 1980s. That was when nanotech-evangelist
Dr. K. Eric Drexler first published his groundbreaking book “Engines of Creation: 
The  Coming  Era  of  Nanotechnology”.  Nanotechnology  could  not  really  took 
off  until  the  electron  microscopy  became  popular.  It  was  also  the  decade  when 
microscopes  that  were  capable  of  manipulating  atoms  and  molecules  on  the 
nanoscale were discovered. 

nanotechnology 
Likewise 
will, once it gets under way, 
depend on the tools we have 
then  and  our  ability  to  use 
them,  and  not  on  the  steps 
that  got  us  there.  -  Eric 
Drexler

Natural Nano-concepts
Nature has created things of nano scale. Let us do the activity 16.1 to get an idea of 
such things and their functioning.

Activity 16.1 

You will need :- Untorn lotus or alocasia leaf 
Method :-   
 ² Put few drops of water on the leaf and observe. 
 ² Record your observations.

Did you see that water droplets 
roll on the leaf without sticking 
and  spreading  on  it? What  can 
be the reason for this? 

Fig. 16.6 - How water droplets are retained on a 
lotus/alocasia leaf 

Lotus effect
The  self  cleansing  activity  of 
lotus  leaves  because  of  the 
hydrophobic  condition  on  its  surface  is  known  as  lotus  effect.  This  hydrophobic 
nature on the lotus leaf is due to the fine arrangement of the particles of nano scale. 
Because of this, water, dirt and micro-organisms that fall on the leaf are automatically 
removed. Lotus effect can be seen on wings of insects like dragon flies.

Figure 16.7 – A water droplet on a lotus leaf (stages of various scales)

Nature made nanomaterials
The best example is the functions taking place inside the cell, which is the structural 
and functional unit of living organisms (Remember the size of the cell is not at nano 
size). In a cell, a large number of nanoscale biological processes like respiration, 
excretion, nutrition, growth and photosynthesis are taking place continuously. Cell 
organelles, specially adopted for those biological functions can be considered as 
machines of nano scale. 

Why ‘Nano’? size matters!
Substances behave differently in the world of atoms and molecules. Both physical 
and  chemical  properties  of  matter  substantially  changes  when  the  size  reaches 
100  nm  or  below  although  it  is  the  same  bulk  material.  For  example,  physical 
properties such as optical, mechanical, electrical and magnetic properties, change 
at the nano-scale while chemical reactivity significantly changes.

e.g.
 ² Metal  copper  is  transparent  on  the 
nanoscale  while  gold,  demonstrates 
a range of colours depending on the 
size and shape at the nanoscales.
 ² Chemically inert gold become highly 
reactive at the sizes below 100 nm.

 ² Carbon  can  be  converted 

into 
resistance free conducting materials 
at nano-level.

 ² Strength  of  carbon  nanomaterials 
could  be  several  times  higher  than 
steel.

Surface area of nano particles

Figure 16.8 - Various colours are observed in 
gold nanoparticles when the size of particles are 
below 100 nm

The main reason for such changes in physical and chemical properties is the increase 
in the surface area (A) to volume (V) ratio (A/V) when the particles size decreases.

As an example let us consider a 1 cm length cube made of silver. The volume of 
the cube is 1 cm3 and surface area will be 6 cm2. This 6 cm2 surface area is equal 
to the surface area of a stick of gum (chewing gum). But, if that volume of 1 cm3 
is filled with cubes of 1 mm length, that surface area of total cubes will be equal 
to the surface area of a single page in an exercise book. When the 1 cm3 of volume 
is filled with 1 nm sized cubes, total cubes needed, have a surface area which is 
about one third of a football court. Nanoscale materials have far large surface areas 
than similar masses of large scale materials. As surface area per mass of a material 
increase, a greater amount of the material can come into contact with surrounding 
materials thus affecting reactivity (Figure 16.9).

How to see the nano-scale?

Your fingers are millions of nanometers long, so it's no good trying to pick up atoms 
and molecules and move them around with your bare hands or see them using a 
common optical microscope.  That would be like trying to eat your dinner with a 
fork 300 km long. 

Scientists have developed electron microscopes that allow us to "see" things on the 
nanoscale and also manipulate them. They are;

•  Atomic Force Microscopes (AFMs)
•  Scanning Probe Microscopes (SPMs)
•  Scanning Tunneling Microscopes (STMs)

to  formation  of  Multi  Wall  Carbon  Nano 
Tube (MWCNT).

According to the researches carried out for a long time, there are expected as well 
as  unexpected  uses  of  nanotechnology.  Nanotechnology  has  contributed  towards 
a  revolutionary  development  in  the  fields  of  security,  communication,  energy, 
food, medicine, transportation, agriculture, textile, polymers, cosmetics, electronic 
science etc. Few of them are described below.

 ² Diagnostic 

tools  are  considered

the  therapeutic  efficiency  can  be 
increased. Nanotechnology is being 
used to diagnose and treat ailments 
like  atherosclerosis.  One  way  of 
doing this is the introduction of nano 
particles which are similar to HDL, 
a  type  of  favourable  cholesterol, 
to  remove  lipid  deposits  in  blood 
vessels.

Lightning  causes  loss  of  human,  animal  and  plant  life.  Only  a  small  part  of  the 
accidents brought about by lightning are reported by mass media.  
Lightning claims loss of lives and property not only in Sri Lanka but also in other 
countries. 
In United States of America, it is reported that 100 deaths and nearly 500 get injured 
within one year by lightning accidents. It has been observed that many lives were 
lost due to negligence of the precautions for preventing lightning accidents.
Therefore, it is important to have an understanding about lightning. 
There are seasons in which the lightning accidents are more frequent. To investigate 
into it do the assignment 17.1.

Assignment 17.1

Collect  information  regarding  lightning  and  thunder  occurred  in  this  year. 
Note down the months in which the lightning activity is highest. 

According to the above newspaper reports (figure 17.1), it 
has been observed that the lightning activity is at its peak 
in  the  months  of  March-April  and  October-November. 
Meteorologists call those two periods inter-monsoons. 

In  these  inter-monsoon  periods  the  temperature  of  the 
atmosphere  close  to  the  Earth  is  high.  Blowing  of  wind 
is  low. This  increases  the  amount  of  water  vapour  in  the 
atmosphere. This water vapour rises up and also gets cooled 
forming  clouds.  Cumulonimbus  is  the  type  of  cloud  that 
contributes most to lightning. Generally, these are located 
at a height of about 15 000 m from the ground level. 

Figure 17.2 - 
Cumulonimbus cloud

Assignment 17.2

Observe continuously the changes taking place in a cumulonimbus cloud formed 
in the afternoon during the inter-monsoonal period and Observe the following. 
 y General increase in height 
 y Flattening of the top
 y Getting darker from the bottom to top. 

17.1  How lightning occurs 

Clouds  contain  crystals  of  snow  and  tiny  droplets  of 
water.  Insides  the  clouds,  wind  blows  fast  from  the 
bottom to the top. This makes crystals and water droplets 
rub  each  other.  Because  of  this  rubbing  electrostatic 
charges are formed in the crystals and water droplets. 
Recall  what  you  have  learnt  about  the  electrostatic 
charges in grade 7. There are two types of electrostatic 
charges as positive and negative. It has been discovered 
that 
in  a  cumulonimbus  cloud  positive  charges 
accumulate  in  the  upper  region  whereas  negative 
charges get collected in the lower region. 

120

Science | Lightning Accidents

Figure 17.3 - How charges are 
distributed in a cumulonimbus 
cloud

Science | Lightning Accidents 121

The air in a cloud is an insulator. Hence electrical charges do not flow easily through 
air. Therefore,  a  large  amount  of  electrical  charges  accumulate  in  the  upper  and 
lower regions of a cloud. When, very large amounts of charges are developed like 
this, a moment will arise where electricity can flow even through air. Then a jump 
of electrical charges or an electric discharge occurs. This phenomenon is known as 
lightning.  

Types of lightning 

Depending on the sites between which the charges jump, lightnings are classified 
into three types.

 y Cloud to cloud lightning
 y Cloud to air lightning
 y Cloud to ground lightning

Photographs illustrating the above three types of clouds are given below. 

Cloud to cloud lightning

Science | Lightning Accidents

Figure17.5 - Induction of positive 
charges on ground due to negative 
charges in the cloud 

A jump of charges either between two regions of a 
charged cloud or between two clouds with different 
charges is referred to as a cloud to cloud lightning. 
Sometimes a discharge of charges accumulated in 
a cloud occurs to surrounding air. It is a cloud to 
air lightning. 
The most dangerous type is the cloud to ground 
lightning. Let us find out how it occurs. 

When  a  charged  cloud  positions  itself  above  a 
certain  point  on  the  Earth,  positive  charges  are 
induced on the ground due to the influence of the 
negative  charged  accumulated  in  the  lower  part 
of the cloud. When the amounts of charges in the 
cloud and on Earth increase, at a certain moment 
negative  charges  from  the  cloud,  jump  to  Earth. 
This is called a cloud to ground lightning.

Science | Lightning Accidents 121

Lightning and thunder 
The  voltage  of  a  cloud  to  ground  lightning  is  about  10  million  volts.  In  such  a 
lightning a current of nearly 25 000 amperes flows. The voltage of an LED lamp 
used in houses is 230 volts while the current flowing through it is less than even 0.1 
amperes. Hence, you will be able to understand how high is the voltage and current 
of a lightning. 
When  such  a  large  current  flows  through  air  in  a  very  short  time  (about 
10 milliseconds), air is heated up to a very high temperature. This temperature is 
about 30 000 0C. It is five times the temperature of the sun's surface. 
Due to the high air temperature, around the lightning current expands instantaneously 
(same thing happens when a cracker explodes). When air expands at once like this, 
first a wave is generated followed by a sound wave. The result of the sound wave 
is the thunder. 
In lightning, both light and sound are born simultaneously. But, light is seen first 
and sound is heard afterwards. The reason for this is that the speed of light is very 
high whereas  the speed of sound  is much  less than  the speed of  light.  Since  the 
speed of light is very high, light travel from the place where lightning occurs to us 
is negligibly small. Sound takes more time to reach us. That is why sound reaches 
us later. 

For extra knowledge 

The speed of light is 300 000 000 m s-1 (3x108 m s-1) and the speed of sound is 
330 m s-1.

During a lightning, if time is measured from the moment of observing light to the 
moment at which the sound is heard, the distance to the point at which the lightning 
occurred can be calculated approximately.

For extra knowledge 

As  the  speed  of  sound  is  330  m  s-1,  it  takes  about  three  seconds  to  travel  a 
distance of 1km (1000 m). So, if the time between the observation of light and 
hearing  of  sound  (in  seconds)  is  divided  by  three,  we  get  the  distance  to  the 
point of lightning in kilometers.

e.g.   Let us assume that the sound was heard 12 seconds after the  

lightning. Then, the distance to the place of lightning is 12/3 = 4 km.

Let us do the activity 17.2 to produce an electric spark (a teacher demonstration).

Activity 17.2 

 ² Produce  an  electric  spark  using  the  induction  coil 

available in the laboratory. 

 ² Observe  the  production  of  light  and  sound  while 

 ²

doing it.  
If an induction coil is not available in the school, a 
spark plug in a motorcycle can be removed from the 
engine and the way a spark is 
produced in it can be observed.   

Figure 17.6 - Producing 
sparks by the induction coil

Caution 
Here,  the  participation  of  the  teacher  or 
an adult is essential. 

Figure 17.7 -  Sparking in a 
spark plug 

In the above activity you would have observed an electric spark. You could have 
also observed the production of light and sound. The length of that spark is only a 
few millimetres or centimetres. But, the length of the spark produced in a lightning 
bolt would be several kilometers. Accordingly, you may understand that the thunder 
accompanying is also intense. 

How lightnings get earthed

There are four ways by which lightnings get earthed harming humans and animals 
and damaging buildings. 
 y Direct strikes
 y Side flashes
 y Contact voltages
 y Step potentials

Direct strikes  

A strike of a lightning on a solitary man, tree or a building 
standing on a flat land is known as a direct strike. 
If  a  human  is  struck  by  a  direct  lightning,  it  would 
seriously affect the person because the lightning current 
flows to the Earth through his/her body.  

Figure 17.8 - A direct strike

Science | Lightning Accidents 123

122

Science | Lightning Accidents

 
 
 
 
Side flashes 
A bolt of lightning hitting a tall building or a free passes into 
the Earth through it and during its passage may side-step from 
it and get earthed through the body of a man standing near by. 
The  reason  for  this  is  that  the  flow  of  the  lightning  current 
through a human body is easier than its flow through a building 
or a tree. 

Figure 17.9 - Side flashes

Contact voltages

Being struck by a lightning at a time of its production because 
of  touching  domestic  electrical  appliances  or  using  cellular 
phones is known as a contact voltage. 

Besides,  a  person  in  contact  with  a  tree  at  a  time  of  the 
occurrence  of  a  lightning  may  also  fall 
prey  to  it  when  it  hits  the  tree.  This  is 
also a contact voltage. 

Figure 17.10 - A contact 
voltage 

Step potentials

When a lightning strikes a building, a tree or the ground the 
lightning  current  spreads  in  every  direction  from  that  place. 
Suppose a person or an animal is standing within such a spread 
area. The lightning current that enter the body of that man or 
the animal from one leg will pass through the other leg. This 
phenomenon is called step potential. 

Figure 17.11 – Step 
potential 

The longer the distance between the two feet, the higher is the potential difference 
and hence the intensity of the current too. That is the reason why it is safer to keep 
the two feet closer at a time of lightning. 

An ox is hurt more than a human by a step potential. This is because the distance 
between the fore limb and hind limb of an ox is greater than that between the two 
feet of a human. This increases the potential difference and hence the current flow 
through the body of the ox. Consequently the damage caused is also greater.  

According to the newspaper reports shown to you at the beginning of this lesson, 
it  would  be  clear  to  you  that  a  lot  of  damage  is  caused  on  human,  animals  and 
property by lightning. Though a systematic calculation has not been carried out, 
the loss of property due to lightning per year in Sri Lanka may amount to billions 
of rupees. 
Therefore, measures should be taken to minimize the losses caused by lightning.

Summary  

 ² Lightning is a natural disaster affecting Sri Lanka. It causes loss of human 

 ²

lives, animal lives and property.
 Lightning occurs mainly due to the accumulation of electrostatic charges in 
cumulonimbus clouds.
 When the clouds heavily laden with electric charges they get discharged. 
 Lightnings are classified according to the way of discharge.

 ²
 ²
 ² Cloud of ground lightnings are the most harmful. They are further classified 

 ²

 ²

 ²

 ²

according to how they get earthed. 
 In a lightning bolt, flow of a high current occurs instantaneously due to the 
high potential difference created between the clouds and the Earth. 
 Thunder is the result of sudden expansion of air due to intense heat generated 
in an electric discharge.
 In a lightning through both light and thunder are produced simultaneously, 
an observer at a distance sees light first and hears the sound afterwards. 
 The damage caused by lightning can be minimized by suitable precautions 
and following safety measures in the occasions of lightning.

Natural Disasters

The losses brought about on humans, animals and  property  by a  natural process 
without the interference of man is named a natural disaster. 
There is a number of natural disasters affecting Sri Lanka. Of them, here we study 
about the below mentioned natural disasters.  

 ² Cyclones 
 ² Earthquakes
 ² Tsunami
 ² Wild fires

18.1     Cyclones 

When the pressure of the air at a certain place in the atmosphere closer to the Earth's 
surface drops below the pressure around that place, a low pressure area is created. 

If this low pressure situation develop further, it becomes a depression. If situation 
develops further it gives rise to a cyclone. 

Figure 18.1 (a) – Satellite picture showing the 
movements of clouds during a cyclone

Figure 18.1 (b) – Movement of air during a 
cyclone

Factors that cause cyclones

 ² Existence of a large oceanic area and its temperature being above 27 0C to a 

depth of 60 m.

 ² Occurrence of convection current in the atmosphere 
 ² Minimal tendency of the horizontally blowing wind to sweep vertically

PB

Science | Natural Disasters

Science | Natural Disasters 129

 ² Location of the point at which the depression is closer to the equator.  (cyclones 

are not formed on the equator)

 ²

Increasing humidity of the atmosphere beginning from surface of the ocean 
to higher atmospheric levels (higher than 60%).

As cyclones are born on meeting the above conditions, they are restricted only to 
some oceanic regions on the Earth.

For extra knowledge 

Types of cyclones
 ” The cyclones formed in the North and South Asian oceans are known as 

tropical cyclones. 

 ” The cyclones generated in the Northern Pacific Ocean are called as typhoons.
 ” Cyclones produced in the North Atlantic Ocean are termed as hurricanes.

Structure of a cyclone 

In  addition  to  the  circulation, 
air  rises  up  in  the  central  part 
of  the  whirl  of  the  cyclone. 
This  upward  movement  of  air 
gives rise to a cylindrical cloud 
wall.  The  central  part  of  the 
whirlwind is called as the eye. 
It  would  have  spread  within  a 
region of 30 - 60 km from the 
centre of the whirl. This eye is 
a  region  with  little  wind  and 
free of rain and clouds. In satellite photographs this appears as a black circle.

Dense cirrus overcast

Figure 18.2 – Cross sectional structure of a cyclone

Eye
Eye wall

Rainbands

The cylindrically arranged cluster of clouds around the eye is known as the eye 
wall. In this region heavy rains and fast blowing winds occur. Due to the eye wall, 
a few spiral bounds of clouds can be seen. In these regions too, heavy and speedy 
winds occur. 

Cyclone is the main mechanism that distributes the huge solar energy received by 
the regions close to the equator of the globe. Cyclones originating time to time in 
Indian, Pacific and Atlantic oceans provide the factors essential for the life of plants 
and animals on the Earth. Though in nature, cyclones is a favourable phenomenon 
like this, today more attention is focused on the disasters brought about by it.

An experience of a cyclone

The date was 26th December 2000. It was a sunny day for Trincomalee 
town. The residents of the town were involved in their daily routing as 
usual. Although the weather forecasts of that day had informed that a 
cyclone would occur, some seemed not to be concerned about it. 

At about eight o'clock a black cloud appeared from the sea side. Before 
half an hour passed, a fast blowing wind swept across the town. At the 
same time it started to rain heavily. Roofs of buildings flew away with 
the wind. Trees were uprooted. Electricity was cut off. Residents of the 
town ran to safer places. 

After some time rain stopped and the wind also subsided. Some people 
came out from the safe places. But, again a strong wind started to blow 
in the opposite direction as earlier. Rain started again. Buildings which 
were not destroyed by the wind which blew first were devastated by 
this second. 

Given below are numerical data about the losses caused by the cyclone 
described above.

- 170 419

 ² Number of families hit  
 ² Number of houses fully damaged  
 ² Number of houses partly damaged  
 ² Amount of cultivated land destroyed - 20 810 acres
 ² Number of deaths  
 ² Loss caused to the national economy - Rs. 1500 million

- 20 860

- 57 273

- 17

Now let us compare the above experiences with the action of a cyclone. Within the 
cyclone winds, the whirl is very fast and that whirl moves in a certain direction with 
a certain speed. 

After  a  strong  blowing  of  wind  from  one  direction,  comes  a  state  of  tranquility. 
That is when the eye of the cyclone passes through that point. When the other part 
of the whirl passes that point, a speedy wind, as was the one blew first, blows in the 
opposite direction.

According to the above table, what are the months in which most of the cyclones 
affected  to  Sri  Lanka  had  occurred?  From  which  areas  had  cyclones  entered  to 
Sri Lanka most?

It may be clear to you that most of the cyclones that defected Sri Lanka had occurred 
in November and December and they had entered Sri Lanka from the Eastern coast.

In 1978, the death toll due to cyclones was 915. However, since warnings could be 
given because of the development of technology, the number of deaths could be 
reduced in subsequent cyclones.

For extra knowledge

Most of the storms affecting Sri Lanka are born in the Bay of Bengal. 

Let us do the activity 18.1 to demonstrate the movement of air during cyclones, 
using water.

Activity 18.1

You  will  need  :-  Two  identical  transparent  plastic  bottles,  water,  gum  tape 

small pieces of paper or colourant

Method :- 
 y Take two identical, transparent plastic bottles.
 y Fill  about  3/4  of  one  of  them  with  water.  Colour  the  water  or  put  some 

pieces of paper into water. 

 y Place the mouth of the empty bottle on the mouth of the bottle containing 

water and connect those two tightly with gum tape. 

 y Now rotate the apparatus slowly in anticlockwise.

Science | Natural Disasters 133

You  will  be  able  to  understand  how  air 
moves  during  a  cyclone  by  the  movement 
of water in the bottle placed on top.

During  the  past  century,  13  cyclones  have 
entered to Sri Lanka from the Eastern coast 
of the country. Among those cyclones, three 
were very powerful cyclones.

Study the above map and prepare a list of districts in Sri Lanka which are prone 
to cyclones.

Using  high  technology,  the  Department  of  Meteorology  keeps  vigilance  over 
the  cyclones  around  24  hours.  In  occasions  of  a  probable  cyclonic  situation 
to  Sri  Lanka,  the  latest  information    about  it  are  communicated  to  the  relevant 
government institutions. The telephone number of the Department of Meteorology 
is 011 2 686 686.

18.2    Earthquakes

An  earthquake  is  a  jolt  or  shoulder  like  movement  of  the  Earth's  surface.  Less 
violent earthquakes are known as tremors. 
Earthquakes and Earth tremors are caused by releasing of the energy stored in 
the Earth's crust. 
Earthquakes bring heavy damages to man-made creations on Earth. 

Figure 18.6 – Photographs of the same area before and after the Earthquake

In order to understand how earthquakes are happening, we need to know about the 
structure of the Earth. The figure 18.7 shows the internal structure of the Earth. 

The Earth is composed of three main structures.

Crust 

Upper mantle 

Lower mantle

Outer core

Inner 
core

Evidences  support  the  fact  that  the  crust,  the 
topmost  layer  of  the  Earth  is  composed  of  a 
number of tectonic plates which move relative to 
one another. The Earth's crust consists of a few 
large  tectonic  plates.  They  can  be  identified  by 
the following map (figure 18.8).

Figure 18.8 – The map of tectonic plates
The tectonic plates which form the Earth's crust move relative to one another. By 
the activity 18.2 you can understand how this happens. 

Activity 18.2

You will need :- Plate or a shallow basin, water, colourant, piece of styrofoam

Method :- 
 y Pour water into a plate or a shallow basin. Add some colour to water. 
 y Cut a polystyrene sheet into pieces and float them on water.

Figure 18.9 – Pieces of styrofoam floating on water

 y Now shake the container gently. 
 y Observe the way the piece of polystyrene move. 

134

Science | Natural Disasters

Science | Natural Disasters 135

The  movement  of  the  pieces  of  polystyrene  corresponds  to  the  way  the  tectonic 
plates move on semi-solid magma in the upper part of the mantle. 

How tectonic plates move
It  has  been  identified  that  there  are  three  ways  of  movement  of  tectonic  plates 
relative to one another at the boundaries. 

•  Divergent border
•  Convergent border
•  Slip border

Divergent border
At this border, the two tectonic plates move away from each other.

Figure 18.10 – Illustration of a divergent border

Figure 18.11 – Mid Atlantic Ridge

At divergent borders, magma in the upper mantle rises up between the two tectonic 
plates and therefore a new crust is created. Most of such tectonic plate borders are 
located in the oceanic floor.

e.g. Mid Atlantic ridge

Convergent border 
At this border, two tectonic plates collide and one plate moves underneath the other. 
Volcanoes erupt in the regions in which these movements occur.
e.g. Saint Helen's mount (Figure 18.13)

Fuca Plate

Science | Natural Disasters 137

Slip border
At this border, the two tectonic plates move away from each other while being in 
contact.
Sometimes, the tectonic plates cram into each other during the movements. Violent 
earthquakes may happen when lot of energy is collected  during such movements. 

e.g. Saint Andrea's fault (Figure 18.15)

Figure 18.14 – A slip border

Figure 18.15 – Saint Andrea's fault

By the activity 18.3, you may have an understanding about how the tectonic plates 
move on the Earth's crust. 

Activity 18.3

You will need :- A boiled egg

Method :- 
 y To  Demonstrate  the  Earths'  crust  and  the  movements  of 

tectonic plates,

 y Tap a boiled egg on the table and make several cracks on it. 
 y The shell of the egg corresponds to the Earth's crust and the 
egg white underneath it, corresponds to the upper mantle. 
 y Colour the boundaries of the cracks using a marker. Take 

Figure 18.16

the egg onto the palm and squeeze it gently, so that the edges move back and 
forth. 

When squeezed, it can be seen that at some pints of the cracks the pieces of shells 
move apart. Those points correspond to divergent borders. At some other places it 
appears that some pieces come closer. Such places illustrate convergent borders. 

In  some  other  places  it  appears  that  the  pieces  of  the  shell  move  forward  and 
backward relatively. Those places correspond to slip borders. 

136

For extra knowledge 

Compared to the Earth, the thickness of the crust is 2% of its diameter. Compared 
to the diameter of an average egg, the thickness of the shell is also 2% of it. 

Intensity of earthquakes
At the points at which the tectonic plates have colloid impact, the layers of rocks 
bend. When the force exerted to bend them exceeds the yield point of the rocks, the 
rocky layers break. This point of breakage is the focus of the earthquakes. The point 
on Earth above the focus is the epicenter.

Figure 18.17 – Focus and epicenter of an earthquake

Seismic  waves  spread  in  all  directions  from  the  focus  of  an  earthquake.  These 
waves convey energy along the surface of the Earth and also through the interior 
of the Earth. 

The strength of these seismic waves can be measured by the seismometers installed 
at  various  places  of  the  Earth.  The  apparatus  which  automatically  records  the 
information related to seismic waves is called the seismograph. 

Figure 18.18 – A Seismograph and its records (Seismograms)

The  scale  that  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  information  recorded  by  the 
seismograph and the damage inflicted to buildings, ground and humans is called 
the Richter scale.

This scale has been introduced by Charles F. Richter in 1953.

in the borderland regions. Of them, too most of the earthquakes have broken out in 
the region called 'Pacific Ring of Fire'. From the map it can be seen that, this region 
is the border of the very large Pacific tectonic plate.

18.3    Tsunami

On the 26th December 2004 we had to face the most ruinous natural disaster which 
affected Sri Lanka in recent times. It was the tsunami disaster. A part of a newspaper 
article published 12 years after the incident is given in the figure 18.20.

'Tsunami' train stops at Paraliya for 5 minutes for the 
commemoration of 2004 Tsunami.

Figure 18.20
In this disaster, 250 000 people died in countries bordering the Indian Ocean. In 
Sri  Lanka  about  40  000  were  died. The  way  that  tsunami  was  formed,  has  been 
explained by geologists as follows. 

That day at 6.58 a.m. in Sri Lankan time, an earthquake of Richter scale value 9.1 
occurred in the sea bed near Sumatra Island of Indonesia. The process taking place 
at a convergent border occurred there. Indian tectonic plate moved underneath the 
Burmese  tectonic  plate.  Owing  to  the  upward  moment  of  the  Burmese  tectonic 
plate and the vast amount of energy released by the earthquake, the oceanic water

Nature of a tsunami wave

Tsunami waves are a type of water waves. Figure 18.23 illustrates the characteristics 
of a normal water wave.

Figure 18.23 – Characteristics of a normal water wave

A water wave comprises of an alternate series of crests and troughs. The distance 
between two successive crests or troughs is called the wavelength. The depth from 
the mid point of a wave to its crest is known as the amplitude. 

Figure 18.24 shows how the wavelength, amplitude and the speed of tsunami waves 
change from deep sea to shallow sea. 

Figure 18.24 – How wave length, and speed of the tsunami waves change when they 
move from deep sea to shallow sea
The affect of the move which occur in sea surface depend on the depth of water 
column. In the deep sea, the speed of tsunami waves is high. Their wavelength is 
also high. But, the amplitude or the height of the waves is low. Therefore, tsunami 
waves cannot be identified in deep sea. Further the ships streaming in deep sea are 
not damaged by the tsunami waves. 

In the shallow sea, the speed of tsunami waves decreases. Their wavelength also 
decreases. But, the amplitude or the height of the waves increases. Hence the boats 
near the coast are damaged by the tsunami waves. 

In  tsunami  waves,  the  trough  first  approaches  the  shore.  Then  the  sea  is  drawn 
backwards. This is a forwarding of an imminent tsunami.

144

Science | Natural Disasters

Science | Natural Disasters 145

Coral reefs and mangroves retard the speed of tsunami waves. Therefore, the coral 
reefs and mangroves should be protected live without causing damage to them.

Since there is a possibility of tsunami following an earthquake, people should be 
vigilant about them. Investigations must be made about the sites which have been 
already damaged by tsunami and the people living in such areas should be made 
aware about them.

18.4   Wild fires

Wild  fires  have  occurred  out  in  jungles  from  the  distant  past.  When  a  forest  is 
dry,  wild  fires  may  erupt  due  to  natural  reasons  such  as  lightning  or  setting  fire 
deliberately or by mistake. 

Figure 18.25 – A wild fire

There are three factors that should be met for a fire to break out. 

 ²
 ²
 ²

Availability of a combustible substance

Availability of a supporter of combustion or oxygen

Heating the combustible substance to the ignition temperature

Several factors are affecting the spread of wild fires.

 ²
 ²
 ²
 ²
 ²

Existence of dry plant leaves or tree stems as the combustible materials
Prevalence of a high temperature
Low humidity (water vapour content) in air
Profuse supply of oxygen to the fire due to blowing wind
Slopy land that helps upward spread of the fire

144

Science | Natural Disasters

Science | Natural Disasters 145

A wild fire is a  terrifying scene.  In a wild  fire, a very tall column  of fire  moves 
forward very fast. The smoke produced in this, rises to a height of thousands of 
meters in the atmosphere. More and more fires also would break out because fire 
flames are carried through air to distant places from the fire.    
Plants and animals have been damaged due to wild fires. Organisms are adversely 
affected  even  by  the  smoke  produced  by  wild  fires.  It  has  been  reported  that 
respiratory  difficulties  and  even  deaths  have  occurred  in  certain  instances.  In 
Sri Lanka approximately 4 000 acres of land has been destroyed in 2016 owing to 
wild fires. 

18.5   The relationship between
increase in  global warming and natural disasters

During the past 100 years, the average temperature of the world has been increased. 
This condition is known as global warming. The graph in figure 18.26 shows how 
the average temperature changed from 1860 to 2000 in the world.

Year

From  the  above  graph  it  is  clear  that  the  average  temperature  of  the  world  has 
increased during this period. Scientists indicate that a main reason for this increase 
in temperature is the greenhouse effect.

Generally, during day time the Earth gets heated up by sun rays. During night, heat 
is  lost  to  space,  so  the  Earth  gets  cooled.  But,  since  the  carbon  dioxide  gas  and 
water vapour in the atmosphere absorb and retain a part of the heat released from 
the Earth, they help to keep the Earth warm. This is called the greenhouse effect. 
This effect creates favourable environment for the living beings on the Earth.  

146

Science | Natural Disasters

Science | Natural Disasters 147

 
 
 
 
However, because of the increase in the 
concentration of greenhouse gases such 
as  carbon  dioxide,  methane,  Nitrogen 
dioxide sulfur dioxide, the temperature 
of the Earth is gradually increasing. In 
addition to the gases mentioned above, 
ozone  and  chlorofluorocarbons  (CFC) 
also contribute to the greenhouse effect. 

The ways by which greenhouse 
gases are added to the environment

Figure 18.27 - Green house effect

 ² Release of carbon dioxide by volcanic eruptions, thermal power plants and 

combustion of fuels in vehicles

 ² Release of methane from heaps of garbage, marshes etc.
 ² Release of CFC from refrigerators, air conditioners etc.

Global warming and cyclones

The  chart  indicates  that  the  number  of  natural  disasters  has  gradually  increased 
during this period. 

From  the  above  information  it  is  clear  that,  there  is  a  relationship  between  the 
increase in global warming and the increase in the number of natural disasters. 

For extra knowledge 

 ² During the period from 2000 to 2009, natural disasters have occurred three 

times more than the number of those occurred from 1980 to 1989.

 ² Globally, the number of natural disasters reported in 1970 was 78, whereas 

the number of those reported in 2004 was 348.

 ² During  the  period  from  1980  to  2009,  the  number  of  natural  disasters 

related to weather has increased by 80%.

What we can do to prevent the increase in global warming

 ² Forestation and conservation of forests
 ² Usage of public transport instead of private transport
 ² Consumption of more plant food and obtaining them from areas close to the 

residence

 ² Economizing electricity - using energy saving electrical appliances
 ² Reducing the amount of materials consumed daily
 ² Living a simple life style without using more materials 
 ² Raising the awareness of others about the above facts

Summary

 ² The  damage  caused  by  natural  disasters  can  be  minimized  by  keeping 
vigilant  over  one's  environment,  use  of  standard  safety  methods  and 
maintaining connection with media of communication.

 ² Because of the development of depressions in the atmosphere, cyclones 

and storms are created.

 ² Lot of damages to property and loss of lives have been brought about by 

cyclones from time to time in Sri Lanka.

 ² Earthquakes would be resulted when the crustal plates of the Earth move 

relative to one another. 

 ² Tsunami  is  mainly  caused  by  the  lifting  of  oceanic  water  due  to  the 

earthquakes in the sea bed.

 ² Earthquakes and tsunami mainly occur in the regions associating with the 

borders of Earths' tectonic plates.

 ²

 ²

In other countries wildfires break out due to natural causes. In Sri Lanka, 
the wildfires are occurred mostly due to human activities.

It is considered that, the number of natural disasters increased due to the 
increase in global warming.

Natural resources are the substances generated naturally, without the influence of 
human activities.

There are some basic natural resources.

 ² Water
 ² Minerals and rocks
 ² Plants
 ² Timber

The conservation of water for the future generation while we are using water today 
is known as sustainable utilization of water. 

Now let us find out about these resources in detail.

19.1   Water

Man cannot live without air more than few 
minutes. Further, he cannot survive without 
water more than a week. Thus, the second 
most  important  resource  on  the  Earth  is 
water.

The base of life on the Earth is water. When 
finding life on other planets, scientists find 
whether there is water on them. The reason 
for this is that the life we know is based on 
water.

Figure 19.1 – Some uses of water

Assignment 19.1

Make a list of some other uses of water, that can be added to the above diagram 
and present it creatively. 

How water is used sustainably  in the past
The natural way that the Earth’s surface gets water is the rain. If rain water is not 
properly used, it flow through rivers and streams upto the sea. It was the slogan 
of great king 'Parakramabhahu', that “Even a single drop of water should not be 
allowed to flow into sea without being used by man or animals”.

A water tank can be introduced as a great creation of our ancient ancestors, used for 
conservation and sustainable use of water.

A reservoir or a water body that is constructed by building a dam across a river or 
a stream is known as a 'wewa'. 

There  are  evidences  to  prove  that  Sri  Lanka  had  a  unique  irrigation  technology, 
uncomparable  to  any  other  country  in  the  world.  Even  now  we  have  more  than 
12 000 large and small 'wewa' and embankments that irrigate the farmlands of our 
country.

Assignment 19.2

Find  the  special  terms  used  for  the  components  related  to  'wewa'  and  make  a 
report.

If there is no air pollution, the purest water that we can receive, is the rain water. 
Now in Sri Lanka, as well as in some other countries, rain water is collected to be 
used.

Figure 19.3 (a) - Collecting rain water

Figure 19.3 (b) – Using collected rain water

Rain water collection in domestic level is very important for the people in small 
islands like maldive islands, where there are no natural reservoirs.

Activity 19.1

Create a model to collect rain water, draining from the roof into a tank. Use the 
Figure 19.3(a) for this.

In dry zone, for the economical use of water 
in agriculture, clay pots filled with water are 
buried near the plants. 

Try this method in your home garden also.

Scientist forecast that pure water will not be 
available for the people in the world in near 
future if recycling and reuse of water is not 
put into practice.

Now  let  us  study  about  minerals  and  rocks  which  can  be  considered  as  another 
natural resource.

19.2   Minerals and rocks
A  mineral  is  an  inorganic  solid  substance  with  a  definite  chemical  composition 
having a crystalline shape. Minerals occur naturally in our environment.

Assignment 19.4

Study  the  map  carefully.  Name  10  sources  of  minerals  and  rocks  found  in  Sri 
Lanka.  Mention  the  places  where  each  of  those  resources  are  found.  State  an 
industry where each of those resources are used.

For extra knowledge

There are about 5 300 minerals identified in the world up to date. Number of 
minerals registered in the International Union for Minerals is about 5 070.

Sri  Lanka  exports  most  of  its  mineral  resources  not  as  end  products,  but  as  raw 
materials. Therefore, we get only the raw material value of those minerals, though 
our country is rich in minerals. 

Now let us study about gems which are very important among the minerals found 
in Sri Lanka.

19.2.1    Gems

Gems are a sort of mineral crystals which are used in 
making jewellery after cutting and polishing.

Gem industry in Sri Lanka has a history of more than 
2 500 years. There are more than 200 kinds of gems 
identified  in  the  world.  It  is  amazing  to  mention 
that,  more  than  70  types  out  of  them  are  found  in 
our small island.

Blue Sapphire is named as the national gem of Sri 
Lanka.

Assignment 19.5

Make a list of the kinds of gems found in Sri Lanka.

Gem mining

Gems are formed in the Earth, attached to large rocks. As the rocks in the mountains 
get eroded, gems detach from them. Those gems then carried away with rain water 
and are buried in plains  of down hill. The deposit of gems and other pieces of rocks 
is known as the vein of 'illama'.
First a proposed place for gems is selected and the mine, which is like a pit is dug. 
When  the  vein  or  'illama'  is  found,  horizontal  tunnels  are  excavated.  Mixture  of 
substances collected from the vein is taken out of the mine and is sifted to separate 
gems.

Figure 19.8(b) – Sifting of gems using a sifting pan

Activity 19.2

Method :-

Demonstration of gem sifting method

Get a milk strainer woven of bamboo peels as a small substitute for a gem sifting 
pan. Using it, sift a mixture of soil, sand and small pieces of pebbles, to separate 
the pebble from the rest (even a separating pan made of clay can be used for this).

Characteristics of gems
Some important characteristics of gems are mentioned below.

 ² Hardness
 ² Resistance to be worn out
 ² Colour
 ² High refractive index

An unerasable streak can be drawn on a sheet of glass using a piece of quartz. The 
reason for this is that the hardness of quartz is higher than that of glass. Mohr’s Scale 
is  prepared  to  compare  the  hardness  of  minerals.  Hardness  index  10  is  assigned 
for diamond, which is the hardest mineral. Hardness index 01 is assigned for talc, 
which is the least hard mineral.

Study the Table 19.3 and answer the following questions.
1.  Hardness index of finger nail is 2.2. Name two minerals that can streak a finger 

nail.

2.  Hardness index of a pile is 6.5. Name three minerals that cannot be streaked by 

a pile.

Gems  like  blue  sapphire,  Ruby,  Topaz  and  yellow  sapphire  found  in  Sri  Lanka 
belong to the Corundum family.

Gems  do  not  ware  out  because  of  their  hardness.  Gems  are  used  as  bearings  in 
mechanical watches because of their resistance to be worn out.

Figure 19.9 – Gems used in a mechanical watch

Figure 19.10 – Gems of various colours

Gems found in Earth are of various colours. Gems acquire their characteristic colour 
because of the trace impurities trapped in them, while they are forming in the Earth. 
Colour is a main factor that increase where an impurity caused to increase the value 
of a material. Hence, this is rare instance, where the value of a material increases 
when mix impurities.

Refractive index of gems is used to identify them scientifically.
When  a  light  ray  enters  from  one  transparent  medium  to  another  transparent 
medium, its pathway changes at the interface. Refractive index is a measurement 
of that change. Refractive indices of some transparent substances are given in the 
table 19.4.

2.4

Because of high refractive index of gems, light rays are reflected repeatedly when 
they are entered through the cut and polished gems. This gives a shine to the gem.

For extra knowledge

Gems with special characteristics

Alexandrite
Emit green colour in 
natural light and red 
colour in artificial light.

Cat's eye
When this gem is cut in 
a special pattern, it looks 
like a cat’s eye in light.

Star sapphire
When this gem is cut in a 
special pattern, six lines 
of light are visible in it.

Though gems are beautiful and attractive, various problems have raised because of 
gem industry.

Problems associated with gem industry
 ² Soil erosion because of irregular mining.
 ² Mud  deposition  and  water  pollution  in  streams  and  water  bodies,  which  are 

used for gem sifting.

 ² Sudden depression of land and land slides occur due to over mining in some 

areas.

 ² Extinction of fauna and forest cover depletion due to mining in forest areas.

160

161

 ² Reduction of crop production as most of gem mining is done in paddy fields.
 ² Collapsing of river banks due to mining near river banks.
 ² Spreading of some diseases like dengue, because of the breeding of mosquitoes 

in abandoned gem pits.

 ² Decreasing of the population of certain trees like coconut, rubber and bamboo 
because of their usage in gem mines to avoid collapsing of fits and tunnels.
 ² Existence of social discrimination between the owners and the workers of gem 

mines, because of the difference of their income level.

 ² Absence of a permanent way of income for the labourers as gem mining industry 

is not done uniformly through out the year.

 ² Deterioration  of  educational  status  of  relevant  area  due  to  the  attraction  of 

youngsters to gem industry.

National Gems and Jewellery Authority has taken certain measures to solve some 
of the above problems associated with gem industry. When issuing permits for gem 
mining, a cash deposit has to be made. If gem pits are abandoned without filling 
government utilize the money deposited to fill the abandoned gem pits.

19.3    Trees

Voluntary contribution of school children 
is taken for replanting those areas.

Plants as a natural resource from cradle to 
grave, man extensively uses plants. Some 
services  rendered  by  plants  to  man  and 
environment are shown in figure 19.11.

Study  figure  19.11  well  and  answer  the 
following questions.

1. Mention five material benefits  

provided to man by plants which    
are shown in the figure.

2. Mention five non-material benefits  

shown here.

3. Write three benefits provided to man  
by plants, which are not mentioned

19.3.1    Timber

The oldest building material is timber. Timber is the only building material that is 
recyclable and renewable. Some special characteristics of timber are as follows.
 y Durability
 y Resistance to heat, electricity and sound
 y Ability of creating attractive patterns due to the streak and the colour

Ancient  times,  Sri  Lanka  was  famous  for  valuable  timber.  Timber  like  ebony, 
satin wood and calamander wood which were in the dry zone of our country, were 
extensively  used  by  colonial  rulers  to  manufacture  furniture.  Now  such  types  of 
timber are very rare in the country.

Therefore, the existing amount of timber should be used with maximum efficiency. 
Selection of timber, according to the durability, which is needed for different uses 
of  timber,  will  lead  to  a  sustainable  utilization  of  timber  that  brings  economical 
advantage.

Diversity  of  timber  in  Sri  Lanka  is  very  high. We  have  more  than  400  kinds  of 
plants in our country, that can be used for timber.

Assignment 19.7

Take leaves of plants in your area that can be used for timber. Insert the leaves 
between  two  pages  of  paper  to  press.  Make  a  booklet  using  pressed  leaves 
(make sure not to harm the plants when taking leaves).

Method :-
 y Collect samples of various types of timber.
 y Note down their colour.
 y Test whether they have any odour.
 y Find out the uses of those types of timber.
 y Find out whether there is any specific use of any of those types of timber.
 y Present your findings attractively.

Specific use of some types of timber
Each types of timber is used for specific purpose according to its properties. Some 
examples are given below.
 y

Jak timber is used for front doors of houses because of its strength, durability 
and shine.

 y Persian  lilac  ('Lunumidella')  timber  is  used  for  ceilings  because  it  is  very 

 y

light.
'Panakka' timber is used for making umbrellas because the stem of panakka is 
thin and strait.

 y Ancient times pegs made of agar wood ('Vallapatta') timber are used to split 

granite rocks.
'Hora'  timber is used for underwater structures because it last long under water.

'Rukattana'/'Elilaippalai'  timber  is  used  to  carve  masks  because  of  the 
lightness and workability.
'Paaramara' timber is suitable to make the frame of “rabana” because of its 
lightness and sonorousness.

 y Alexandrian lawrel ('Domba') timber is resistant to vibrations, bending and 
twisting. Therefore it is used for masts of yachts, neck-pole of bullocks carts 
and yoke pole of ploughs.

Wooden bridge of Bogoda
This bridge is located at Hali-Ela in Badulla district. Even though it is about 400 
years old, still it is in use.

Wooden bridge of Bogoda

Jak and 'Kumbuk' timber were used to construct this bridge. Wooden nails were 
used to connect its beams. Ebony and 'Milla'/'Kattamanakku' timber were used 
for its wood carvings.

Assignment 19.8

Prepare a collection of information about plants used for specific purpose. Get the 
assistance of the elders of your area for this task.

Decaying of timber

Fungi can grow inside the timber. Timber is decayed because of the degradation of 
complex carbohydrates which timber are made of due to the activity of enzymes 
secreted by those fungi.

Fungi can retain inactively, even for many years inside timber. They grow when 
favourable conditions are available. Such favourable conditions are the presence 
of oxygen, moisture and nutrients. Out of those, the most important factor is the 
moisture. Though other factors are available, fungi do not grow in the absence of 
moisture.

Food is stored in some cells of tissues of timber. Timber can be destroyed by termites 
and weevils who come in search of food.

Prevention from timber being decayed
Long lasting types of timber were abundant in ancient Sri Lanka. Therefore, timber 
preservation methods are not necessary.

the 

With 
increase  of  human 
population  and  human  needs,  such 
types  of  timber  have  become  very 
rare, due to over usage.

For  example  timber  like  ebony, 
'Nadun' and Teak are now classified 
as luxurious types of timber. 

Alburnum

Heartwood

Therefore,  we  are  compelled  to 
use  fast  growing  types  of  timber 
like  rubber,  Persian  lilac,  mango, 
alstonia,  eucalyptus  and  pinus.  But, 
such types of timber do not last long in the environmental conditions of our country. 
They  are  easily  damaged  by  insects  and  fungi. Therefore,  we  have  to  use  wood 
preservative methods.

Figure 19.13 – Alburnum and heartwood of an 
Ebony tree

Generally  the  heartwood  of  a  tree  lasts  longer  than  its  alburnum.  Therefore, 
heartwood of a tree should be used when making furniture to minimize them from 
decaying.
Now let us find out how decaying of timber can be prevented.

Methods of preventing the timber decay

 ² Prevention of absorbing moisture into timber
 ² Seasoning of timber
 ² Usage of wood preservatives

Prevention of absorbing moisture into timber
Moisture  absorption  into  timber  can  be  prevented  by  applying  enamel  paint  on 
them.
e.g. Enamel paints are applied on school desks and chairs to prevent decay.

Science | Sustainable use of Natural Resources

165

164

Science | Sustainable use of Natural Resources

Seasoning of timber
Timber  can  be  seasoned  by  allowing  it  to  dry  slowly  in  controlled  conditions. 
Timber can be kept for long time by reducing the moisture content below 20%.
You can get a knowledge of this method by observing a timber stores or a carpenters 
workshop.

Figure 19.14 – Seasoning of timber

Usage of wood preservatives

Timber can be preserved for a long time by soaking in suitable chemicals. 
One such chemical is creosote, which is extracted from coal. This chemical is used 
by State Timber Corporation when they are treating sleepers for railway lines and 
wooden electrical posts.

Figure 19.15 (a) – Sleepers on railway line

Figure 19.15 (b) – Wooden electrical posts

Boron treatment is done for the longer life of rubber and pinus timber. Here the 
timber is soaked in a mixture of boric acid, borax and a fungicide.

Forest  conservation  is  promoted  by  proper  usage  and  preservation  of  timber. 
Increasing the lifetime of timber can be reduced tree felling. 

Water, minerals and rocks, plants and timber are ours valuable resources. Therefore, 
it  is  our  responsibility  to  use  them  sustainably,  while  leaving  their  potential  of 
existence for the generations to come.
