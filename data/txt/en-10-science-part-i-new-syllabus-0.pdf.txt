Being innovative, changing with right knowledge
Be a light to the country as well as to the world.

Message from the Hon. Minister of Education

The past two decades have been significant in the world history due to changes 
that took place in technology. The present students face a lot of new challenges 
along with the rapid development of Information Technology, communication 
and other related fields. The manner of career opportunities are liable to change 
specifically in the near future. In such an environment, with a new technological 
and intellectual society, thousands of innovative career opportunities would 
be created. To win those challenges, it is the responsibility of the Sri Lankan 
government and myself, as the Minister of Education, to empower you all. 

This book is a product of free education. Your aim must be to use this book 
properly and acquire the necessary knowledge out of it. The government in 
turn is able to provide free textbooks to you, as a result of the commitment 
and labour of your parents and elders.

Since we have understood that the education is crucial in deciding the future 
of  a  country,  the  government  has  taken  steps  to  change  curriculum  to  suit 
the rapid changes of the technological world. Hence, you have to dedicate 
yourselves to become productive citizens. I believe that the knowledge this 
book provides will suffice your aim. 

It is your duty to give a proper value to the money spent by the government on 
your education. Also you should understand that education determines your 
future. Make sure that you reach the optimum social stratum through education.

I congratulate you to enjoy the benefits of free education and bloom as an 
honoured citizen who takes the name of Sri Lanka to the world.

Foreword 

The educational objectives of the contemporary world are becoming more 
complex along with the economic, social, cultural and technological development. 
The learning and teaching process too is changing in relation to human experiences, 
technological  differences,  research  and  new  indices.  Therefore,  it  is  required  to 
produce  the  textbook  by  including  subject  related  information  according  to  the 
objectives in the syllabus in order to maintain the teaching process by organizing 
learning  experiences  that  suit  to  the  learner  needs.  The  textbook  is  not  merely 
a  learning  tool  for  the  learner.  It  is  a  blessing  that contributes to  obtain a  higher 
education along with a development of conduct and attitudes, to develop values and 
to obtain learning experiences.

The government in its realization of the concept of free education has offered 
you all the textbooks from grades 1-11. I would like to remind you that you should 
make the maximum use of these textbooks and protect them well. I sincerely hope 
that  this  textbook  would  assist  you  to  obtain  the  expertise  to  become  a  virtuous 
citizen with a complete personality who would be a valuable asset to the country.

I would like to bestow my sincere thanks on the members of the editorial 
and writer boards as well as on the staff of the Educational Publications Department 
who have strived to offer this textbook to you.

Introduction

This textbook was compiled by the Educational Publications Department in 
accordance with the syllabus prepared by the National Institute of Education for 
the use of Grade 10 students in the Sri Lankan school system with effect from 2015.
An effort has made here to arrange the subject content to suit the the national 
educational  goals,  common  national  competencies,  the  objectives  of  teaching 
science and the content of the syllabus.

The  subject  of  science  directs  the  student  towards  a  more  active  learning 
process  in  a  manner  as  to  develop  knowledge,  skills  and  attitudes  needed  for  a 
developmental scientific thought.

Each chapter is compiled based on the three main subject areas that comprise 
the  Science  subject;  Biology,  Chemistry  and  Physics.  Pictures,  charts,  graphs, 
activities  and  assignments  are  included  to  enable  the  easy  understanding  of  the 
related concepts of the subject.

At  the  end  of  each  chapter,  a  summary  was  included  and  it  provides  the 
opportunity to identify the basic concepts of each chapter and to revise the subject 
matter. Furthermore, there is a series of exercises at the end of each chapter. It will 
contribute to measure the expected learning outcomes through a self evaluation.

Activities,  self  evaluative  questions,  solved  examples,  assignments  and 
exercises are planned in a manner as to develop the higher order skills such as  It 
enables the students to develop knowledge as well as the higher order skills such as 
comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation.

For  the  purpose  of  directing  the  student  to  study  further  about  the  subject 
matter, more information is included in the “For extra knowledge”. It is given only 
to broaden the subject area of the child and certainly not to ask questions at term 
tests.

Some of the activities mentioned in the textbook could be performed at home 
and  some  of  them  should  be  performed  in  the  science  laboratory  of  the  school. 
Activity  based  learning  helps  to  create  a  liking  towards  learning  science  in  the 
students and it will easily establish the concepts.

We  would  like  to  bestow  our  sincere  thanks  on  Professor  T.R.Ariyarathne, 
Professor J.K.D.S. Jayanetti of the Department of Physics, University of Colombo, 
Professor Shamala Thirimanna of the Department of Plant Sciences, University of 
Colombo and the Chief Project Officer (Retired) W.D.Wijesinghe of the National 
Institute of Education and the Retired Principal H.S.K. Wijethilake.

Chemical Basis of Life 01

Biology

The bodies of all organisms are composed of variety of chemical compounds. These 
chemical compounds are formed by the bonding of naturally existing elements in 
different ways.

There are only about 25 elements in the living body out of the 92 elements present 
in  nature. They are present at different locations in the body in different forms.

The most common 4 elements in the living body are Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen and 
Nitrogen. Other than above Sulphur, Phosphorous, Sodium, Potassium, Calcium, 
Magnesium, Iron and Chlorine are essential for the survival of organisms.

Figure 1.1 shows the percentages of main elements in the human body.

Chemical compounds that build up living matter can be divided into two categories 
as organic compounds and inorganic compounds. Compounds which contain Carbon 
are known as organic compounds and compounds which do not contain Carbon are 
known  as  inorganic  compounds.  (Carbon  dioxide,  Carbon  monoxide,Carbonates 
and  Bicarbonates  are  some  of  the  inorganic  compounds  which  contain  Carbon) 
Those organic compounds that build up the living body or living matter are known 
as bio molecules. They are:

² Carbohydrates
² Proteins
² Lipids
² Nucleic acids

1'1 Carbohydrates

This is the most abundant organic compound on  earth. They are produced during 
the  photosynthesis  of  green  plants.  Potato,  sweet  potato,  grains,  sugar,  flour  are 
some of the examples for foods which contain carbohydrates. 

The main elemental composition of carbohydrates is Carbon (C), Hydrogen 
(H) and Oxygen (O). 
Hydrogen and oxygen combine in 2:1 ratio in  carbohydrates.

Disaccharides

Two  Monosaccharides  join  to  form  a  Disaccharide.  During  this  process  a  water 
molecule is released. In the same way relevant Monosaccharides can be obtained 
by hydrolyzing Disaccharides. Disaccharides are sweet, water soluble crystals.

Polysaccharides

Polymerisation  of  a  large  number  of  monosaccharides  form  a  polysaccharide 
molecule.  Hydrolysis  of  Polysaccharide  results  relevant  monosaccharides. 
Insoluble in normal water. They are not crystals. Cellulose, Starch and Glycogen
are  examples  for  polysaccharides.  The  structural  unit  of  Cellulose,  Starch  and 
Glycogen is Glucose , but their properties are different according to the number of

1.2 Proteins
Protein is an essential constituent in all living cells. Carbon(C)  Hydrogen (H), 
Oxygen (O) and Nitrogen (N) are always present in proteins. Sometimes Sulphur 
can also be present.

17%  of  the  mature  human  body  is  composed  of  proteins.  Protein  is  a  complex 
molecule  made  up  of  polymerized  amino  acid  molecules.  Meat,  fish,  egg  white 
cereals are some of the foods rich with proteins.

feathers also contain keratin protein.

 y

As enzymes

enzymes. The enzymes are proteins.

y

As hormones

Some hormones are proteins which involve in homeostasis and coordination

  An extra amount of Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and then few    

drops of Copper Sulphate is added into it.(CuSO4)

  Solution turn to purple colour

■  Enzymes

The special proteins (organic catalysts) that are produced within the organism to 
increase the rate of bio-chemical reactions are known as enzymes.

For example to convert Sucrose into Glucose, Sucrose has to be heated with a dilute 
acid. But the enzymes present in the digestive system do the same reaction at a low 
temperature.

Therefore the activity of enzyme is to catalyze the bio-chemical reactions.

Engage in the following activity on how enzymes function.

The blue colour of the drop obtained from the mixture gradually reduces with 
time and finally obtains the colour of Iodine (yellow /brown colour) 

Starch gives black blue colour with Iodine but it does not give colour change 
with Iodine after 20 minutes as there is no Starch there.That is because Starch is 
converted to Maltose by Amylase enzyme.

1'3  Lipids
Fats and oils belong to this group. Lipids which are solid at room temperature are 
called fats and liquids are called oils.

Similar to carbohydrates, fats also contain Carbon, Hydrogen and Oxygen as 
constituent elements.  But a lipid contains much less oxygen than a carbohydrate.
Lipids are insoluble in polar solvents including water. They are soluble in organic 
solvents.

Ground nut, coconut, gingelly, butter and margarine are examples for foods which 
contain lipids. 

Fatty acids and glycerol react to form Lipids.

Lipids act as an energy source as carbohydrates and proteins. More energy 
is produced during burning of lipids.

To form different structural components

Lipid is one of the most important compounds in cell membrane. 
(Specially phospho lipids and cholesterol)

For conservation of water

The wax known as cutin present on the surface of the plant body conserve 
water. Most animals' body covering also contains wax which helps to avoid 
desiccation as it is impermeable to water.

To maintain the body temperature

Warm blooded animals such as birds and mammals possess a hypodermal 
fat layer which acts as a thermal insulator. It helps to maintain their body 
temperature.

To protect internal body organs

The fat layer surrounds the organs and structures in the body and absorbs 
external shocks. Thereby provides protection.
To synthesize some hormones
Some Hormones of vertebrates (Oestrogen, Testosterone, Cortisone) are 
lipid compounds.

saturated fatty acids                           unsaturated fatty acids

Saturated fatty acids 

fatty acids which contain only single bonds within Carbon atoms are called 
saturated fatty acids. Saturated fatty acids exist in room temperature as 
solids or semi-solids. 
Unsaturated fatty acids

fatty  acids  which  contain  one  or  several  double  bonds  within  Carbon 
atoms are called unsaturated fatty acids.

Unsaturated fatty acids exist in room temperature as liquids.

1'4   Nucleic Acids

Nucleic  acid  is  the  most  important  molecule  out  of  the  main  bio  molecules  in 
living matter in genetical aspect. It is a linear polymer made up of large number of 
nucleotides. It contains Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), Nitrogen (N)

1'5 Water

The highest proportion of the body mass of living organisms is composed of water 
which is an inorganic compound.  Two third (2/3rd) of the body weight of most of 
organisms is by water. Water is an essential medium for the maintenance of living 
matter. Life originated in water. Composition of water is simple. As water is the 
most abundant inorganic compound found in livings beings, it is important in many 
biological functions. The table below, shows the specific properties of water and 
contribution of them to the maintenance of life.

Physics

2.1 Distance and displacement

Distance is a concept familiar to you.  When you go from home to school, you have 
to travel a certain distance.  Sometimes, there can be several paths you could use to 
travel between home and school.  Some of them could be shorter and some longer.

Figure 2.1 shows several paths that a child could take, to travel from a point A to 
another point B.

path P
distance 320 m

path Q

distance 200 m

East

distance 160 m

path R

distance 240 m

B

A

Figure 2.1 – Several paths between points A to B 

If path P is used, the distance between point A to point B would be 320 m.  If path Q
is used, this distance would be 200 m.  If path R is taken, the travel distance would 
be 240 m.  This shows that the distance depends not only on the starting and the end 
points, but also on the path used to traverse the distance.

Whichever the path the child uses to reach B after starting from A, the ultimate result 
is that he has moved a distance of 160 m from A to B on a straight line towards the 
east . A change of  position like this, that occurs from one point to another point in 
a particular direction is called displacement. The magnitude of the displacement is 
the shortest distance between the two points.

A    physical  quantity  which  can  be  described  only  by  its  magnitude  is  called  a 
scalar quantity.

eg: speed, mass, time, distance

A  physical  quantity  which  can  be  described  by  its  magnitude  and  direction  is 
called a vector quantity. 

eg: displacement, acceleration, velocity, weight

In the example above, the displacement of the child is 160 m to the east.  Although 
the distance has changed according to the path taken, the displacement has remained 
the same.

In addition, there is another important difference between distance and displacement.
Because we do not take the direction into account when measuring the distance,  
distance has only a magnitude. It does not have a direction.  Therefore, distance 
is a scalar quantity.  However,  when measuring the displacement, the direction is 
important. In other words, the displacement has both a magnitude and a direction.  
Therefore it is a vector quantity.

Let us understand this concept further with following examples.

(i)  Black colour arrow in the figure 2.2 shows the path taken by a child to travel  

from home to school. 

home

Total  distance  that  the  child  has 
travelled  between  home  and 
school is
=AB + BC + CD = 100 m + 400 m
+ 200 m = 700 m
However, the straight line distance 
from  home  to  school  is  500  m.  
This means that the magnitude of 
the  displacement  is  500  m  while 
its direction is along AD.

Even  though  the  distance  travelled  by  the  child  along  this  path  is  400  m,  the 
magnitude of his displacement is 120 m and the direction is along AB.

An  athlete  who  runs  in  this  track  from  A  to  B  reaches  the  point  B  after  running 
a  distance  of  200  m.    Then  the  displacement  of  the  athlete  can  be  indicated  by 
the straight line AB.  The magnitude of his displacement is 160 m.  Its direction 
according to Figure 2.5  is 70o  from the north to west. This  displacement can be 
expressed in the following manner.

straight line path as shown in Figure 2.6.

Figure 2.6 – Path of a child walking from A

The  displacement  of  the  child  is  60  m  along  AB.  Thereafter,  if  the  child  walks 

another 40 m along the same direction and reaches point C, what would be his total 

displacement?

When two or more displacements occur along the same direction, they can be either 
added or subtracted using ordinary arithmetic.

Since  the  displacements  in  the  above  example  are  in  the  same  direction,  total 
displacement   = 60 m + 40 m = 100 m

This means that the child is now at a point 100 m away on a straight line from the 
starting point. 

Now suppose that the child walks back 40 m after reaching the point B, as shown 
in Figure 2.7, instead of walking forward. The displacement corresponding to 40 m 
is in the opposite direction to that of AB. According to the figure 2.7 it is clear that 
the total displacement is given by the line AC.  Therefore, although the distance 
traversed in this case too is 100 m, his displacement would be 60 m + (-40 m).  
That is 20 m.

If he walked the same distance in the opposite direction after reaching the point B, 
his displacement would be 60 m + (-60 m).  That is, a zero (0) displacement.  From 
this we know that the child is back at the starting point.

2.2 Speed

We frequently hear about accidents caused by vehicles moving at high speeds.  

Due to this reason, there are different regulatory 
speed limits assigned to different roadways.  We 
should  obey  these speed limits in order to prevent 
accidents,  particularly  in  highways  with  high 
speed limits.

What  we  mean  by  speed  is  the  rate  at  which  a 
given distance is traversed.

speed =

 distance 
    time

In other words, speed is the distance traversed in a unit time.

26

27

 
 
Vehicles moving in roadways cannot maintain the same speed throughout the travel 
time. The speedometer of a motor vehicle usually indicates only the speed of the 
vehicle at a particular instant. When there is heavy traffic, vehicles have to slow 
down,  and  when  there  are  pedestrians  crossing  the  road,  the  vehicles  even  have 
to stop.  On the other hand, if there are only a few other vehicles in the road, the 
same speed can be maintained for a fairly long distance.  Let us consider two such 
instances, one where the same speed is maintained, and the other where the speed 
changes with time, through the following examples.

The distance traversed by a certain object at different instances in time is shown in 
the table below.

According to these data, 

Distance traversed by the object during the first second  = (3 - 0) = 3 m

         Distance traversed during the next second  = (6 - 3) = 3 m

Similarly, the distances traversed during each of the third, fourth, fifth and sixth 
seconds is also 3 m.

That is, the object has traversed 3 m during each 1 s time interval. Therefore, in this 
case we can say that the object has moved at a uniform or constant speed.

speed =

distance
time

Since the time is given in seconds and the distance in meters, 
the speed has the unit ms-1 (    ). Accordingly, the above object 
has a speed of 3 m s-1.

Therefore the distance traversed by this object during each interval of one second is 
not the same.  That is, this object has not travelled with a uniform speed.

In such instances, where an object does not travel with a uniform speed, it is useful 
to calculate the mean speed of the object during a given time interval.  The mean 
speed of an object can be calculated by dividing the total distance travelled, by the 
corresponding time interval.  Mean speed is also known as the average speed.

mean speed or average speed =

total distance travelled
total time duration

The total distance travelled by this object during 6 s is 18 m.  Therefore, the average 
distance travelled during a second = 18
6

3=  m. 

That is, the mean speed or average speed of the object 

As another example, let us consider a vehicle  that travelled a distance of 100 km 
from a location near Colombo to Peradeniya in 2 hours. In such a journey, a vehicle 
cannot maintain the same speed throughout the whole journey.  However we could 
divide the total distance of 100 km by the total time duration of 2 hours as done 
above to calculate the average speed, which is 50 kilometers per hour.

2.3 Velocity

Because we calculate the speed in terms of distance, we do not consider the direction 
when we calculate the speed. Therefore, it must be clear to you by now, that the 
speed is a scalar quantity.  The velocity however, is defined as the rate of change of 
the displacement.  Therefore, it is a vector quantity that has both a magnitude and 
a direction.

The velocity of an object can be obtained by dividing its displacement by time.

Velocity = 

displacement 
 time

We learnt earlier that sometimes, bodies could move with uniform speeds while at 
other times they could move with non-uniform speeds.  In a similar manner, the 
velocity of a body too can be uniform during certain time intervals while it can be 
non-uniform at other intervals. 

The table below shows the displacement of a body along a specific direction, at the 
end of each 1 s time interval, as measured from the starting point.

Since the increase in the displacement of the body during each second is 3 m, the 
motion has taken place at a constant or uniform velocity.

When a body is moving at a constant velocity, neither the  magnitude nor the 
direction of its velocity changes with time.

If  a  body  moves  along  a  straight  line  at  a  constant  velocity  of  6  m  s-1,  then  the 
change in the displacement during each 1 s interval is 6 m.  The direction of the 
motion too remains constant.  If the body moves at this constant velocity for 5 s, 

then its displacement after 5 s = 6 m s-1× 5 s = 30 m.  

That is, for a body moving at a constant velocity, the displacement after a certain 
time  interval  can  be  obtained  by  multiplying  the  velocity  by  the  relevant  time 
interval.

Displacement = velocity × time

The following table shows the displacement of another object moving on a straight 
line, as measured during each 1 s time interval.

The displacement of this object is 4 m in the first second, 3 m in the second  second, 
and 2m in the third second etc. As the displacement is not the same in every second, 
the velocity of the object is not uniform. In such occasions we can calculate the
mean velocity.

2.4 Acceleration

In everyday life we mostly encounter, objects that move with non-uniform velocities.  
Vehicles moving in roadways have to increase or decrease their velocities frequently.  
Sometimes they have to change their direction.  The result of all these changes is 
the change of velocity.

The following table shows the manner in which  the velocity of a body that travelled 
along a straight line varied with time.

According to the above data, the velocity of the body has changed from 0 m s-1 to 
12 m s-1 during a 6 s period

end of 6 s

velocity

When we divide the above velocity change (12 m s-1) by the time duration for this 
change (6 s), we get the rate of change of the velocity.

The rate of change of the velocity is known as the acceleration.  That is, the change 
in velocity per unit time is the acceleration.

32

33

 
 
 
 
        
We already know that the unit of the velocity is m s-1.  Since the acceleration is the 
velocity change in a second, the acceleration has the unit ms-2(    ).

ms-1
s

Therefore we can calculate the acceleration of the above object in the following 
manner.

Acceleration  =

( 12 - 0 ) m s-1

=

2 m s-2

=

=

When a body has an acceleration of 2 m s-2, it means that its velocity changes by 
2 m s-1 during each second.  If the acceleration has a positive value, it implies that 
the velocity is increasing. A negative acceleration means a decrease in the velocity.

Suppose that a body moving in a straight line had an initial velocity of 12 m s-1, 
which later varied with time as shown in the following table.

Time t (s)

Here, the velocity has decreased.  The acceleration of this body can be calculated 
in the following manner.

   Acceleration =    

change of velocity

time

( 0 - 12 ) m s-1
=    
4 s
=    -3 m s-2

Here,  we  have  obtained  a  negative  value  for  the  acceleration.    It  means  that  the 
velocity has decreased by 3 m s-1 each second.

If  the  velocity  is  decreasing,  the  acceleration  takes  a  negative  value. A  negative
acceleration is known as a deceleration.  

If a body has an acceleration of -3 m s-2, it means that the body has a deceleration 
of 3 m s-2.

If the velocity of a body either increases or decreases by the same amount every 
second, then that body is said to have a uniform acceleration or deceleration.

In order to find the displacement of a body moving at a uniform acceleration, we 
should find the mean velocity of the body and multiply it by the corresponding time.

   Displacement = mean velocity × time

Mean velocity = initial velocity + final velocity  

                     time

Example 1

A  body  that  starts  from  rest,  is  subjected  to  a  uniform  acceleration  for  6  s  after 
which,  it  acquires  a  velocity  of  12  m  s-1.   What  is  the  displacement  of  the  body 
during this time interval?

Since the acceleration is uniform, we can find the mean velocity by dividing the 
sum of the initial and final velocities by two.

during 4 s, calculate the deceleration of the object.

2. 5 Displacement-time graphs

Graphs that illustrate how the displacement of a body varies with time are known 
as displacement - time graphs.  These graphs are plotted by marking the time on the 
x-axis and the displacement on the y-axis.

Since the velocity is uniform in this case, we get a straight line for the graph. For a 
body with the non - uniform velocity, we get a curve for the graph. The velocity can 
be obtained by determining the gradient of the graph.

The gradient of a straight line can be calculated by dividing the difference between 
the  y-coordinates  of  any  two  points  on  that  line  by  the  difference  between  the 
corresponding x-coordinates of the two points. However, if two distant points are 
chosen to find the gradient the result will be more accurate.

Since the x-axis represents time, the difference between the x-coordinates of two 
points is a time interval.  The corresponding difference between the y-coordinates 
is the displacement of the body during that time interval. What we get when the 
displacement is divided by time is a velocity.

2.6 Velocity-time graphs

In order to represent the variation of velocity with time, velocity-time graphs are 
used.  In velocity-time graphs, the time is plotted on the x-axis while the velocity is 
plotted on the y-axis.

The  table  below  gives    the  variation  of  velocity  with  time  for  the  motion  of  an

Figure 2.10 - A velocity - time graph

This graph is a straight line, because the increase in the velocity during each 1 s 
interval is the same.  This represents a motion with a uniform (constant) acceleration.

As mentioned before, the gradient of the straight line can be obtained by dividing 
the  difference  between  the  y-coordinates  of  any  two  points  on  the  graph  by  the 
difference between the corresponding x-coordinates.

In this graph also, the x-axis represents time.  Therefore, the difference between x
coordinates gives a time interval.  The corresponding difference in the y coordinates 
gives the velocity difference during this time interval.  Velocity difference divided 
by time gives an acceleration.

Figure 2.11 shows the velocity - time graph for the motion of a body moving at a 
constant velocity of 6 m s-1.  Since the velocity remains the same in a motion taking 
place  with  a  constant  velocity,  this  graph  is  a  straight  line  parallel  to  the  x-axis.

Since the velocity of the motion described by the above graph is 6 m s-1, you can 
calculate the displacement as shown below, using the formula you learnt in section 
2.3.

As shown in Figure 2.11 , the area under the straight line is 6 × 8 = 48 m.  This area 
is calculated by multiplying the length along the x-axis (time) by the length along 
the y-axis (velocity).

That is, the displacement is equal to the area under the velocity - time graph.

Let us now consider how we could find the displacement of a body moving at a 
uniform acceleration using its velocity - time graph.

A body starting from rest, acquires a velocity of 12 m s-1 after moving at a constant 
acceleration for 4 s.  A velocity - time graph plotted for this motion is shown in 
Figure 2.12.

According what we learnt in section 2.4, the displacement of a body moving with a

Displacement = mean velocity × time

Therefore, for the motion shown in Figure 2.12,

That is, the displacement of a body moving at a uniform acceleration is 
equal to the magnitude of the area under the velocity-time graph.

This graphical method provides you with another way of finding the displacement 
of an object.

Example 

A body with an initial velocity of 8 m s-1 moves under a constant deceleration, and 
comes to rest after 4 s.  Plot the velocity - time graph for this motion and find the

•  Now consider the following problem.  
An object starting from rest, acquires a velocity of 15 m s-1 after moving for 6 s 
under a uniform acceleration.  Then the object moves with that velocity for 6 s and 
comes to rest after decelerating for 3 s.

•  During  the  periods  of  heavy  traffic,  vehicles  have  to  reduce  the  speed 
frequently.  When  the  vehicles  begin  to  move  again,  the  engine  has  to 
produce extra power.  This process causes an energy loss.  Such losses can 
be minimized by travelling during hours of low traffic whenever possible.

2.7 Gravitational acceleration

By  experience  we  know  that  when  a  body  falls,  its  velocity  increases  gradually. 
That is, the body accelerates.  In order to give rise to an acceleration, a force must 
act  on  the  body.  The  force  that  acts  on  a  falling  body  is  the  gravitational  force 
exerted by the earth. The acceleration caused by the earth’s gravitational attraction 
is known as the gravitational acceleration.  Its symbol is g.

The average value for the gravitational acceleration at sea level is about 9.8 m s-2. 

This  means  that  the  velocity  of  a  free  falling  body  increases  by  9.8  m  s-1  every
second.

When  a  body  is  moving  vertically  upwards,  the  velocity  decreases  by  9.8  m  s-1
every second.  Therefore, the gravitational acceleration of a body moving vertically 
upwards is, -9.8 m s-2.

Suppose  that  a  body  falling  vertically  down  after  starting  from  rest  takes  4  s  to 
reach the ground.  Its velocity change during each second can be stated as follows.

Initial velocity  = 0

Velocity at the end of 1 s  = 9.8 m s-1

Velocity at the end of 2 s  = 19.6 m s-1

Velocity at the end of 3 s  = 29.4 m s-1

Since it took 4 s to fall to the ground, the velocity upon reaching the ground, that    

is the velocity at the end of 4 s  = 39.2 m s-1

Height that the body fell during 4 s  = mean velocity × time

The velocity - time graph for the above motion is shown in Figure 2.13.

Summary

² The distance traversed by a body to move from a certain point to another 
point depends on the path taken.  But its displacement depends only on the 
initial and final points.

² Distance has a magnitude only. It is a scalar quantity.

² Displacement is a vector quantity.  The magnitude of the displacement is 
the straight line distance between the initial and final points.  Its direction is 
the direction of the straight line segment drawn from the initial to the final 
point.

² The rate of change of distance or the distance traversed in a unit time is 

known as the speed of an object.  Speed is a scalar quantity.

Atoms are the building units of matter. The atom is composed of subatomic particles. 
Among them, protons, electrons and neutrons are the main subatomic particles.

The electron is a negatively charged particle. Proton has a positive charge while 
neutrons  have  no  charge.  With  the  identification  that  particles  called  electrons, 
protons and neutrons constitute matter, and as a result of the effort taken to describe 
how  those  particles  are  organized  in  matter,  the  atomic  model  was  introduced.  
According to the nuclear model put forward by Ernest Rutherford in 1911, there is 
a very small area called nucleus at the centre of the atom.
If the atom is a football ground, nucleus is a small volume, even smaller than a 
chickpea at its centre. From this example, it is clear that the nucleus of an atom is

very small relative to an atom. Protons and neutrons are accumulated in the nucleus. 
The nucleus is positively charged.

Electrons revole around the nucleus. The number of electrons in an atom is equal to 
the number of protons. However the protons and electrons are oppositely charged 
and therefore, the atom is electrically neutral.

3.1 The Planetary Model of the Atom

The  planetary  model  of  the  atom  was 
introduced by 
Rutherford.
Ernest 
Electrons  move  around  the  nucleus    in 
which the positive charge of the atom is 
concentrated. This is similar to the solar 
system where the planets revolve around 
the sun (Fig. 3.1).

revolve  very 

Though  electrons  are  attracted  by  the 
positive  charge  of  the  nucleus,  they  do 
not  fall  on  the  nucleus.  This  is  because 
electrons 
fast  around 
the  nucleus.  Niels  Bohr  who  further 
elaborated the Rutherford's model stated that the electrons move in definite paths 
or shells around the positively charged nucleus.The shells in which the electrons 
revole around  the nucleus are assigned either numbers 1, 2, 3, 4...... or letters K, L, 
M, N...... respectively starting from the nearest to the nucleus. 

Fig - 3.1 - The planetary model of the atom
Fig. 3.1 - The planetary model of the atom

The shells are also known as energy levels. Each energy level has a specific energy. 
When  moving  away  from  the  nucleus  this  energy  increases.  Nevertheless,  the 
difference  between  the  energy  levels  decreases  (Fig  3.2).  In  an  atom,  there  is  a 
maximum number of electrons in any energy level.Table 3.1 gives the total number 
of electrons in the first four energy levels nearest to the nucleus. There is a specified 
energy for each energy level.

 y Atomic number

Assignment 3.1

Make  models  of  the  atom  to  show  its  three 
dimentional  nature  by  selecting  suitable 
materials  according  to  the  instructions  of 
the  teacher.  Display  your  creations  in  your 
classroom.

The atomic number is the number of protons in an atom of the element. 

Atomic number of the element = number of protons in an atom of the element

For example, there are 11 protons in the nucleus of a sodium atom. Thus, the atomic 
number of sodium is 11.The number of protons in every atom of the same element 
is equal. The number of protons in different elements is different. Therefore, the 
atomic numbers of two atoms of different elements will never be the same. Hence, 
the atomic number of an element is a unique characteristic of that element.
For instance, if the atomic number of an element is 6, it means that the element is 
carbon. In no other element, the atomic number is equal to 6. The atomic number of 
an element is symbolised by Z. In a neutral atom, the number of protons is equal to 
the number of electrons in it. So, it implies that the atomic number of an element is 
equal to the number of electrons in an atom of that element.

However, when chemical reactions take place, electrons may be either lost from or 
gained by atoms. Such charged atoms are called ions. The number of electrons in 
an ion may be less or more than the number of protons. But, since the number of 
protons in an ion formed by a particular atom does not change, its atomic number 
remains unchanged.

y Mass number

Of  the  fundermental  subatomic  particles  called  protons,  neutrons  and  electrons 
contained in an atom, electrons are very light. The mass of protons and neutrons 
is  nearly  equal.Approximately,  the  mass  of  an  electron  is  1/1840  the  mass  of  a 
proton. So in comparison to the mass of protons and neutrons in an atom, the mass

of electrons is negligibly small. Therefore, the mass of an atom depends only on the 
mass of protons and neutrons. The sum of the number of protons and neutrons 
in the nucleus of an atom is called the mass number.

\  mass number = number of protons + number of neutrons

Symbol A signifies the mass number of an element.

 y Atomic number of sodium is 11.

 y Hence, a sodium atom contains 11 protons. 

 y

If it contains 12 neutrons,the mass number of the sodium atom = 11+12=23.

There is a standard way of writing the atomic number and mass number of an 
element. On the left hand side of the symbol of the relevant element, the atomic 
number is written at the bottom and the mass number at the top. 

  Example (  The mass number of sodium (Na) is 23.
 Its atomic number is 11.

                Na

Z - atomic number 

 atomic number - 11  

mass number   - 23

The difference between the mass number and the atomic number gives the number 
of neutrons in the atom.
3.2 Electronic Configuration
The  maximum  number  of  electrons  that  can  be  accomodated  in  the  respective 
energy  levels  according  to  the  atomic  model  accepted  at  present  was  discussed 
earlier.  Representing    how  electrons  are  filled  in  the  respective  energy  levels 
from  the  one    nearest  to  the  nucleus  of  an  atom  and  outwards  is  called 
electronic configuration. Let's look at an example. The atomic number of sodium 
is  11.  Therefore,  a  sodium  atom  has  11  protons  and  11  electrons.  Those  eleven 
electrons in the sodium atom are distributed as 2 electrons in the first energy level, 8 
electrons in the second energy level and 1 electron in the third energy level. Hence 
the electronic configuration of sodium can be written as follows.

3.3  Modern Periodic Table

As  at  present,  more  than  115  elements  have  been  discovered.  Studying  their 
properties individually is a very tedious task. Scientists in various parts of the world 
collect information about elements and their compounds continuously. This host of 
information is so large and diverse that no one is able to memorise all the facts about 
them. Therefore different scientists have attempted to classify elements in various 
ways.The  periodic  classification  is  the  greatest  result  of  this  attempt. A  Periodic 
Table for classifying elements was first introduced by Dmitri Mendeleeff ,a Russian 
scientist.

The  modern  Periodic  Table  (Fig.  3.3)  is  based  on  the  atomic  number  and  the 
electronic  configuration.  The  periodic  law  states  that  the  properties  of  elements 
are periodic functions of their atomic number. This means that when the elements 
are arranged in the ascending order of their atomic numbers, elements with similar 
properties recur at regular intervals of elements.

Dividing Elements into Periods  

The Period to which an element belongs is decided by the number of energy levels 
(shells) carrying electrons in an atom of that element.

Period 1   

- Only the first energy level carries electrons 

Period 2  

- Only the first and second energy levels carry electrons 

Period 3  

- Only the first, second, and third energy levels carry electrons

 y Dividing Elements into Groups

The  properties  of  an  element  depends  on  the  number  of  electrons  present  in  its 
outermost energy level. These are known as valence electrons. As per the above 
table, it is seen that the properties of lithium which has only one valence electron is 
similar to that of sodium.

How to Find the Position of an Element in the Periodic Table

Example :- Atomic number of magnesium (Mg) is 12.  

      Electronic configuration - 2, 8, 2

The  number  of  energy  levels  carrying  electrons  in  a 
magnesium atom is 3. 
So, it is an element in Period 3. Number of electrons in 
the outer energy level of a magnesium atom is 2.
Therefore it belongs to Group II
Magnesium is in Group II and Period 3 of the Periodic 
Table. 

Example - Atomic number of potassium (K) is 19.

      Electronic configuration - 2, 8, 8,1

The number of energy levels carrying electrons in 

a potassium atom is 4.Therefore it is an element in 
Period 4.

3.4 Isotopes
Among the atoms of the same element too, there may be atoms with different number 
of neutrons. But their atomic number, that is the number of protons, is equal. That 
means, there may be atoms with different mass numbers in the same element. The 
atoms with different mass numbers in the same element are known as isotopes 
of that element.

Examples for isotopes

Hydrogen has three isotopes. They are called protium, deuterium and tritium.

In the Periodic Table it can be seen that the physical and chemical properties of 
the elements change according to a systematic pattern across a Period from left to 
right and from top to bottom of a Group. To study those patterns, let's consider the 
following properties of the elements.

 y
 y

First ionisation energy
Electronegativity

 y First ionisation energy

In accordance with the nuclear model of the atom, its electrons orbit the nucleus. 
The negatively charged electrons are attracted by the positively charged nucleus, 
so to remove an electron from an atom energy must be supplied to overcome that 
attraction. When an electron is removed from an atom, it becomes a positive ion.

Fig. 3.7 - First ionisation energy values of the 
elements with atomic numbers 
1-20 (kJ mol -1)

Na(g) 

The  first 
ionisation  energy  of  an 
element  is  the  minimum  energy  that 
should  be  supplied  to  an  atom  in  the 
gaseous state to remove an electron to 
form  a  unipositive  gaseous  ion.  The 
formation of a unipositive gaseous ion 
by removing an electron from an atom 
in the gaseous state can be represented 
by a chemical equation as follows. 
 Na+(g)  +  e

This energy is a comparatively small value for an atom. Therefore, this value is   given 
for 6.022 x 1023 atoms or a mole of atoms. Fig. 3.7. indicates the values for one mole 
of atoms of respective elements. Accordingly, the first ionisation energy of sodium is 
495 kJ mol-1 .              

In a given Period, the Group I elements have the minimum first ionisation energy. Also 
in  every  Period,  Group  VIII  elements  have  the  maximum  ionisation  energy  .From 
left to right in a Period, the first ionisation energy varies in a regular manner. This is 
confirmed when the variation of ionisation energies in the second and third periods are 
examined using the graph (Fig 3.8).

Fig. 3.8 - The graph of ionisation energy variation against atomic number for first 20 elements

Structure of Matter

Assignment - 3.2 

Draw  a  graph  of  the  first  ionisation  energy  values  of  elements 
of  atomic  numbers  1  -  20  given  in  the  Fig.  3.7,  against  the  atomic 
number. Use a graph paper for this assignment. Describe how the first 
ionisation energy varies across a Period from left to right and from top 
to bottom in a Group using your graph.

It is seen that in Group I elements, values of the first ionisation energy decrease 
from top to bottom of the Group. You can understand this by examining the values 
of the other groups also. Therefore, it can be concluded that, from top to bottom of a 
Group, the ionisation energy decreases. Descending a group, the number of energy 
levels in an atom increases.Therefore, the attraction exerted by the nucleus on the 
electrons in the outer energy level becomes less making the removal of electrons 
easier.

 y    Electronegativity

Electronegativity  means  the  ability  of  an  atom  of  an  element  to  attract  the 
electrons  of  a  bond  towards  itself  when  it  is  bonded  to  an  atom  of  another 
element. The attraction of an atom of higher electronegativity towards electrons 
is greater than that of lower electronegativity. More about electronegativity will be 
discussed under the unit on chemical bonds.

As    per  the  Pauling  scale,  fluorine  is  considered  the  element  of  highest 
electronegativity.  There  are  several  scales  to  quantify  the  electronegativity  of 
which  the  Pauling  scale  has  been  adopted  here.  Pauling  scale  does  not  assign 
electronegativity values to noble gases (Noble gases show less tendency to form 
chemical bonds).

Study  the  electronegativity  values  and  the  graph  that  illustrates  the  variation  of 
electronegativity values well. It can be seen that the electronegativity increases from 
left to right across a Period. It is also seen that, down a Group, electronegativity 
decreases.

 y Metals

Structure of Matter

Of the elements identified so far, more them 80 are metals. In nature, these exist 
as native metals as well as compounds of metals. Metals such as silver and gold 
are found as native metals in nature whereas many metals such as iron, aluminium, 
magnesium and sodium exist as their compounds.

Physical Properties of Metals

Sonorous (give a ringing sound when struck).

Given below are some properties of metals.
 y Have a metallic lustre (have a shiny surface).
 y
 y Exist in solid state at room temperature (mercury, though a metal is a liquid )
 y Malleable (can be hammered into sheets) and ductile (can be drawn into wires)
 y Good conductors of heat and electricity
 y Generally have a high density

Chemical Properties of Metals

 y

 Metals form positive ions or cations by losing electrons. 

 They combine with oxygen to form basic oxides. 

 The oxides when dissolved in water form basic solutions.

 y  Some Metallic Elements 

Sodium

Sodium is a metallic element belonging to Group I 
of the Periodic Table. It is a highly reactive element. 
It  never  exists  as  the  native  metal.  Because  of  its 
high reactivity it exists only as compounds. Sodium 
chloride,  the  main  compound  containing  sodium 
occurs in sea water.

Do this activity under the directions of your teacher. 
 y Observe and report on how sodium metal is stored in the laboratory.
 y Take out a piece of sodium using forceps, place it on a dry surface and 

cut it with a knife.

 y Leave it for about five minutes. Note the observations. 

Sodium  metal  is  stored  in  paraffin  oil  or  kerosene  so  that  it  does  not  come  into 
contact with air. When sodium metal is taken out of paraffin oil, its lustre disappears. 
The metal can easily be cut with a knife. The freshly cut surface offers a silvery 
lustre but it gets tarnished after some time.

Physical properties of sodium metal 

 y It  is a soft metal which can easily be cut with a knife. 
 y It floats on water because its density (0.97 g cm-3) is less than that of water. 
 y It is a conductor of heat and electricity. 

Chemical properties of sodium metal  

 y Sodium  shows  a  high  reactivity  towards  oxygen.  It  reacts  rapidly  with 

oxygen in air to form the oxide of the metal.

 y Sodium metal vigourously reacts with cold water forming sodium hydroxide 

and hydrogen gas.

 y It reacts violently with dilute acids and forms salt and hydrogen gas (Since 

this is extremely dangerous you shouldn't attempt this. )

Uses of sodium 

 y Production of sodium cyanide used in the extraction of gold and silver
 y Making  sodium  amalgam  which  is  used  as  a  reducing  agent  in  organic 

chemistry

Magnesium

Structure of Matter

Magnesium  is  a  light,  reactive  metal.  It  does  not 
exist as the native metal in nature. In sea water it 
occurs  as  magnesium  chloride.  When  exposed  to 
air  magnesium  tarnishes  so  its  lustre  cannot  be 
seen.  But  when  cleaned  with  a  sand  paper,  the 
lustre becomes visible.

Physical properties of magnesium

 y It is a good coductors of heat and electricity.
 y Has a higher density than that of water (Density is 1740 kg m-3).

Chemical properties of magnesium

 y When heated in air, magnesium burns with a bright white flame giving   

white magnesium oxide.

 y Magnesium does not react with cold water but reacts with hot water. As a   
    result, it forms magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. When the metal is 
strongly heated in steam, magnesium oxide and hydrogen gas  are formed.
 y Magnesium rapidly reacts with dilute acids and forms the corresponding   

magnesium salt and hydrogen gas.

Uses of magnesium

 y By  mixing  magnesium  with  aluminium,  an  alloy  called  magnelium  is 
produced(This alloy is strong and resistant to corrosion. It is used in aircraft 
industry and in making parts of automobiles).
 y Production of medicines (e.g. milk of magnesia).
 y Used as a metal that prevents corrosion of iron.

 y Non - metals

Chemistry

Generally, non – metals have properties opposite to those of metals. There are non 
– metals which occur as native elements as well as compounds of other elements. 
Some non – metals occur in solid state while some others exist in liquid and gaseous 
states. At  room  temperature  carbon,  sulphur,  phosphorus  and  iodine  exist  in  the 
solid state. Bromine is a liquid at room temperature. Chlorine, fluorine, nitrogen 
and  oxygen  are  some  non  -  metals  occurring  in  the  gaseous  state.  Non  -  metals 
do not have a metallic lustre. They cannot be hammered into sheets or drawn into 
wires. Many non – metals are brittle and are poor conductors of heat and electricity. 
However graphite, a non - metal is a conductor of electricity. Non-metals have a 
relatively low density but the density of diamond is high. 

Chemical Properties of Non – metals

 y Non - metals form negative ions (anions).
 y Many oxides formed by non – metals with oxygen are acidic. Mostly these 
exist in the gaseous state. They easily dissolve in water and form acids.

 y Some Non – metallic Elements 

Nitrogen

Nitrogen  exists  as  a  free  and  diatomic  gas  in  the  atmosphere. About  78.1%  by 
volume in the atmosphere is nitrogen gas. Nitrogen is also present as a component 
in animal and plant proteins. Nitrogen also exists as a constituent element in soil 
air, in organic substances such as humus and in nitrates, nitrites and ammonium 
compounds. 

Physical properties of nitrogen

 y
 y

It is colourless and odourless.

It is lighter than air and is slightly soluble in water.

Chemical properties of nitrogen

 y Nitrogen is a non - supporter of combustion.
 y

It is a gas of very low reactivity. Nevertheless, at high temperatures, nitrogen 
gas reacts with non metals such as oxygen, hydrogen, carbon and silicon as 
well as with metallic elements such as magnesium and aluminium. 

 y When  sent  through  a  strong  electric  arc,  nitrogen  combines  with  oxygen 
in  the  atmosphere  to  form  unstable  nitric  oxide  gas. The  nitric  oxide  gas 
so formed reacts further with oxygen in air to form an acidic gas, nitrogen 
dioxide. During lightning, this process occurs naturally.

Sulphur

Sulphur is an element that exists in different forms 
in nature. Those forms are referred to as allotropes. 
Sulphur  occurs  in  crystalline  form  as  a  yellow 
brittle solid (Fig. 3.14) and in amorphous form as a 
white powder. In nature, it is found both as a native 
element  as  well  as  compounds  like  sulphates  and 
sulphides. It is a constituent element in some amino 
acids found in the bodies of living beings. Sulphur 
clearly shows the properties of non – metals.

abundance.  It  occurs  as  carbon  dioxide  gas  in  the 
atmosphere,  animal  and  plant  tissues,  all  organic 
compounds,  coal,  petroleum  products  and  other 
hydrocarbons  containing  carbon.  It  is  an  element 
showing  allotropy.  Carbon  has  crystalline  forms 
as  well  as  amorphous  forms.  In  crystalline  forms, 
atoms are orderly arranged but in amorphous forms 
there is no such arrangment.

Except  diamond,    the  other  forms  of  carbon  are  black  in  colour  and  exit  in  the 
solid state. Their density is relatively low. But diamond is the form with highest 
density. Diamond is much valued because of its high refractive index and hardness. 
Diamond is a poor conductor of electricity. But, graphite is a good conductor of 
electricity. Charcoal has the ability to absorb gases.

Chemical properties of carbon

Carbon  is  an  element  of  low  reactivity.  It  combines  with  oxygen  at  very  high 
temperatures  but  does  not  react  with  substances  like  acids,  bases  and  chlorine.

element. Present your information to the class.

3.7 Chemical Formulae  

 y Valency

The combining ability of an atom of an element is known as the valency. This is 
measured relative to hydrogen. Accordingly, the valency of an element is either the 
number of hydrogen atoms which can combine with or can be replaced by an atom 
of that element. The electrons present in the outermost energy level of an atom of 
an element are called valence electrons. Some elements can have several valencies. 
The number of valence electrons in an atom of an element is generally equal to its 
highest valency.

The valency of an element is equal to the number of electrons lost from or gained 
by an atom of that element or the number of pairs of electrons shared between the 
atoms during chemical combination.

We know that chemical symbols are used to identify elements easily.

hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. This is called the chemical formula of water.

If  there  is  a  number  at  the  bottom  of  the  symbol  of  an  element  in  a  chemical 
formula, it indicates the number of atoms of that element present in a molecule of 
the compound. If there is no such number, only one atom of that element is present 
in a molecule of that compound.

 y Writing Formulae Using Valency 

Compounds are formed by the attachment of atoms or ions of elements by chemical 
bonds. Therefore, to write the formula of a compound, their combining powers or 
valencies should be known. The formula is written so that the respective combining 
powers are balanced.

 y The valency of hydrogen is 1.
 y The valency of oxygen is 2.
 y So, two hydrogen atoms can combine with one oxygen atom. 
 y This is written as H2O.
 y The valency of nitrogen is 3.
 y Hence, three hydrogen atoms can combine with one nitrogen atom. 
 y This is written as NH3.
 y The valency of carbon is 4. So, four hydrogen atoms can combine with one 

carbon atom.

 y This is written as CH4.

atoms so that their combining powers become equal. This is done by exchanging 
the valencies of the two elements and writing them at the bottom end on the right

Newton’s laws of motion 04

4.1 Nature of force and its effects

You have studied about force in your previous classes.  When we push something, we 
apply a force. When we pull something also, we apply a force. Lifting, compressing 
are also results of applying forces.

What should we do to move a body which is at rest?  We have to apply a force in 
the direction we need to move the body.  However, does it start to move as soon as 
we apply the force?

Try to push a table as shown in Figure 
4.1.  If it does not move, increase the 
force.  When you keep increasing the 
force,  at  some  point,  it  will  begin  to 
move. 

Figure 4.1 - Pushing a table

If you try to move a bus yourself, in the 
same  manner  that  you  tried  to  move  the 
table, the bus would not move.  But if  you 
push it with the help of a group of people 
as  shown  in  Figure  4.2,  it  would  move.  
That  is,  if  we  apply  a  force  sufficient  to 
overcome a force that tends to oppose the 
motion of an object, then it would begin to 
move. The force that opposes the motion 
of  the  object  is  a  resistive  force  called 
friction.  If the force that we apply is small, 
it would balance with the resistive force. 
Since the net force acting on the object at 
such an instance is zero, the object would not move.  If we apply a sufficiently large 
force, the resistive force would not be able to balance it, and then there would be an
unbalanced force acting on the object, which could set the object in motion.  

Figure 4.2 - Pushing a bus

If the above mentioned table was on a very smooth surface, such as ice, even a very 
small force would be sufficient to start the motion. That is because, when there is 
no resistive force, the whole force that we apply becomes an unbalanced force and 
contributes to the motion of the table. When ever an unbalanced force acts on an 
object at rest, the object starts to move. 

Figure  4.3  shows  a  cart  loaded  with  goods 
being pulled by  a  bull.   If  someone applies 
a  force  from  behind,    in  the  direction  that 
the cart is moving, then the cart would move 
faster.  If a force is applied in the direction 
opposite to the direction of motion, the cart 
would slow down. This shows that the result 
of applying a force depends on the direction 
of the force.

This  means  that  the  force  has  both  a 
magnitude and a direction.  Since there is a 
magnitude as well as a direction, the force is 
a vector. The direction of a force acting on 
some point can be indicated by a  straight line drawn from that point. This line is 
called the line of action of the force.

Figure 4.3 - A cart pulled by 
a bull

What we experience about force and motion has been studied in depth by the famous 
scientist, Sir Isaac Newton.  He has formulated three laws of motion based on his 
studies.  Let us now investigate each of these laws.

Newton’s first law

Until  an  unbalanced  force  is  applied  on  it,  bodies  at  rest  remain 
stationary and bodies in motion continue to move at uniform velocities.

From day to day experience we know that bodies at rest do not start moving without 
external  forces  acting  on  them.    However,  we  often  observe  that  moving  bodies 
come to rest without an external force exerted on them by us.  Let us consider the 
following example in order to understand this.

84

Consider  the  case  of  striking  on 
the carom disc on a carom board 
with your fingernail as shown in 
Figure 4.4.  Then the disc would 
move  a  short  distance  and  come 
to rest. If we apply some talcum 
powder  on  the  carom  board  to 
make  the  surface  smoother  and 
then  repeat  the  above  action  by 
striking on the disc with roughly 
the same force as before, the disc 
would  move  a  much 
longer 
distance before coming to rest.

Figure 4.4 - Striking a carom disc

The  action  of  the  talcum  powder  on  the  board  is  to  reduce  the  resistive  forces 
exerted on the disc by the carom board.  The resistive force that opposes the motion 
of an object on a surface, is called friction.  If by some means we could make the 
frictional force equal to zero, the disc would move without stopping.

Let us consider another example that we experience in daily life, connected to this 
law.  Suppose a passenger is standing on a moving bus without holding any thing 
for support.  If the bus suddenly stops by applying brakes, the passenger would fall 
towards the forward direction.  What is the reason for this?

Since his feet were in contact with the floor board of the bus, the floor board exerts 
a resistive force on the feet and brings the feet (which too had the speed of the bus)
to rest.  Since no such force is exerted on the upper parts of his body, their velocity, 
carries him forward.  He falls in the forward direction because of this.

Now suppose that the above passenger is in a bus at rest.  If the bus starts to move 
without his knowledge, the passenger would now fall in the backward direction.  As 
the bus starts, it would exert a force on the feet of the passenger giving the lower 
part of his body a velocity.  The upper part of his body however does not have this 
velocity and remains at rest, resulting in his falling back.

Seat belts must be  worn when riding in  a vehicle to prevent the passenger from 
falling forward upon applying brakes.  As the seat belt exerts a force on the upper 
part of his body as well, the whole body remains at the velocity of the vehicle even 
when brakes are applied. if no belts are worn the upper part of the body has some 
velocity and tends  to go forward.

Figure 4.5 –  Seat belt privents the driver being thrown forward when breaks are applied.

Newton’s second law

The acceleration of a body is directly proportional to the unbalanced force 
acting on it, while it is inversely proportional to its mass.

Here,  ''the  acceleration  is  directly  proportional  to  the  unbalanced  force''  means 
that  when  the  magnitude  of  the  unbalanced  force  is  increased  or  decreased  by  a 
certain ratio then the acceleration also increases or decreases by the same ratio. 

This is symbolically written as a  ∝  F. 

Similarly "the acceleration is inversely proportional to the mass" means that if the 
mass is increased  by a certain ratio, then the acceleration decreases by the same 
ratio, and if the mass is decreased by a certain ratio, then the acceleration increases 
by the same ratio.

This statement is symbolically written as, a   ∝  

1
m

 .

Therefore Newton’s second law can be written as

∝ 

         a  

a   ∝  F and

The unit of force is defined in such a way that the above constant is equal to one.
That  is,  if  the  unit  of  force  is  defined  in  such  a  way  that  the  force  required  to 
produce a unit acceleration (1 m s-2) in a body of unit mass (1 kg) is equal to 1 
Newton (1 N), Then the value of the left hand side of the above equation becomes 
1, That means  when

F / m
F / m
F / m

= 1

then the constant will also become 1. Therefore, Newton's second law can be written 
as 

F = ma

A force is acting on an object, gives rise to an acceleration.

Let us consider the following experiment in order to verify Newton’s second law.

            Figure 4.6 - Demonstrating that the acceleration of a trolley increases with force 

●  Place a trolley on a horizontal surface, attach a rubber band to the trolley and 

hold the trolley with one hand.

●  Hold the free end of the rubber band with the other hand as shown in Figure 4.6 

and pull it until it is extended to the other end of the trolley.

●  Next,  release  the  trolley  and  move  your  hand  along  with  the  trolley,  without 
changing  the  extension  of  the  rubber  band.    You  will  notice  that  the  trolley 
moves with an acceleration.

●   Attach  another  rubber  band  similar  to  the  first  one  to  the  trolley  and  stretch 
both  to  the  other  end  of  the  trolley  as  before  and  repeat  the  experiment.   As 
the force on the trolley is now twice the force in the previous step, you will be 
able to observe that the trolley moves  with a  larger  acceleration than before.

●   Repeat the experiment with three rubber bands and observe that the acceleration 
is even larger than that in the second time.  Since there are three rubber bands, 
the force exerted on the trolley is three times as large as in the first time.

●  Accordingly, it can be observed that the acceleration of the trolley increases as 

the force exerted on it is increased.

●  Now place a mass on the trolley and repeat the experiment with one rubber band 
and observe the motion of the trolley.  You will observe that the acceleration has 
decreased.

● Then repeat the experiment with another mass placed on the trolley and you will 

notice that the acceleration decreases further.

From this it will be clear that the acceleration decreases with increasing mass if the 
force is constant.

a  =

It is clear from the above equation that for a constant force, the acceleration increases 
if the mass is decreased and the acceleration decreases if the mass is increased.

What is the force required to give an acceleration of 2 m s-2 to a 5 kg mass?

   F  = ma

   = 5 kg × 2 m s-2
     = 10 N 
      (1 kg m s-2 = 1 N)

Example 2

A force of 12 N is applied on a body of mass 6 kg, moving at a uniform velocity, in 
the direction of its motion.  Find the acceleration of the body.

     (b) If the above force is applied in the direction opposite to the direction 

of motion of the body, find its deceleration.

Newton’s third law

For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

Here, an action means a force exerted by an object on another object.  Then the 
reaction is a force exerted on the first object, by the second object.

Expulsion  of  air  from  an  inflated  balloon  is  a  practical  situation  where  this  law 
can be applied.  Hold a balloon filled with air, with its opening turned downwards.

Loosen the hold on the opening and release the balloon as shown in Figure 4.7.  
You will notice that the balloon would initially move upwards rapidly and later fall 
down.  Air leaves the balloon as its rubber walls push the air molecules downwards.  
The balloon moves upward due to the reaction force exerted on the rubber walls by 
the air molecules moving out.

air molecules down)

A balloon moving due to air leaving the balloon can also be illustrated as shown 
in Figure 4.8.  Attach a straw to an air filled balloon as shown in Figure 4.8, using 
cellotape.  Insert a metal wire through the straw and fix it horizontally from the two 
ends. Allow the air in the balloon to leave by removing the thread that closes the 
opening of the balloon.

You will be able to observe the balloon moving on the metal wire in the direction 
opposite to that of the air leaving the balloon.

Another instance illustrating the action and reaction is shown in Figure 4.9. Place 
two planks of wood on a few glass balls. Let two children sit on the two planks.  
If they push each other with their palms as shown, it would be possible to observe 
them moving in opposite directions.

Figure 4.9 - Two children being pushed in opposite directions when pushing 

each other with their palms.

A few other instances where Newton’s third law is applied are mentioned below.

When rowing a boat (Figure 4.10), water is pushed in the backward direction using 
the oars.  That is, a force is applied on water by the oars.  Then the boat moves 
forward due to the reaction force applied on the oars by water.

Figure 4.10 – Force applied on the water by the oars and the reaction force acting on the boat. 

In swimming (Figure 4.11), the swimmer exerts a force on water in the backward 
direction. Then water exerts the reaction force on the swimmer's body in the forward 
direction. Because of this, the swimmer moves forward. The action in this case is 
the backward force applied by the hands. The reaction is the forward thrust exerted 
by water.

4.2 Momentum

The momentum of a moving body is a measure of how difficult it is to stop the 
motion of that body.

It  would  be  an  easy  task  to  catch  a  pen  or  pencil  thrown  to  you  by  a  friend.    If 
however, somebody throws a putt or some other heavy object towards you, it would 
not be so easy to catch it. If the same object is handed over to you without throwing 
then it would not be difficult to take it to your hand.

The reason for the difficulty in catching such an object is not only its large mass 
but also the speed with which it is moving.  A bullet fired from a gun has very small 
mass.  But once it is fired, we cannot even think of catching it.

Therefore, we can conclude that the level of difficulty in stopping a moving body 
depends on two factors; mass and velocity.

In physics, the momentum (p) of a body is defined as the product of the mass (m) 
of the object and its velocity (v).

Momentum   = mass  × velocity

p 

=   m  ×  v

The unit of mass is kg. The unit of velocity is m s-1.  Therefore, 
the unit of momentum is kg m s-1.

Since the velocity is a vector, the momentum is also a vector.

When  a  motor  vehicle  is  moving  fast,  it  possesses  a  large  momentum.   When  it 
reduces its velocity, the momentum decreases.  When it speeds up, the momentum 
increases.

= 40000 kg m s-1

Example 2

A  bullet  of  mass  10  g  fired  by  a  gun  moves  at  a  velocity  of  400  m  s-1.  Find  its 
momentum.

In  this  problem,  when  we  substitute  the  value  of  mass  to  the  equation,  we  must 
convert the mass to kg.

4.3 Mass and weight

The mass of an object is the amount of matter in it.  The international unit of mass 
is the kg.

The weight of an object is the force with which it is attracted towards the earth.  
That is, the force acting on it due to gravitational attraction of the earth.

According  to  Newton’s  second  law,  the  force  acting  on  a  body  moving  at  an 
acceleration is given by, 

 F =   m a 

If  it  is  moving  under  gravity,  then  its  acceleration  would  be  the  gravitational 
acceleration g.  Then, the force exerted on the body is its weight and it is given by,

Weight = mass × acceleration  =   m g

Because the weight is defined as a force, its international unit is the Newton (N).

The point of which this force acts is the centre of gravity ot the body. 

Since  the  gravitational  acceleration  near  the  surface  of  the  earth  at  sea  level  is 
9.8 m s-2, the weight of a body of mass m is 9.8m. The weight of an object of mass 
1 kg would be 9.8  N.

Attractive force exerted by the earth on a mass of 3 kg (weight) = 3 kg × 9.8 m s-2

= 29.4 N

When  we  go  up,  starting  from  sea  level,  the  gravitational  acceleration  gradually 
decreases.  Therefore,  if  we  take  an  object  to  the  top  of  a  mountain,  the  weight 
of  the  object  becomes  less,  while  the  mass  remains  constant.  On  the  moon,  the 
gravitational acceleration is about 1/6 of that on the earth. Therefore, the weight of 
an object on the moon is about 1/6 of the weight of that object on the earth.

Summary

²  According  to  Newton’s  first  law,  until  an  unbalanced  force  acts  on  it,  a 
stationary body remains at rest and a moving body continues its motion at a 
uniform velocity.

²  Newton’s  second  law  states  that  the  acceleration  of  a  body  is  directly 
proportional to the force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.

²  Newton’s third law states that for every action, there is a reaction equal in 

magnitude and opposite in direction to the action.

²    The weight of an object is the force with which it is attracted to the center 
of the earth.  It is equal to the force that is required to accelerate it with the 
gravitational acceleration g.

5.1 Nature of friction

If we place an object such as a pencil on a table and tap on it so that it starts to move  
on the table, we know from experience that its speed would gradually decrease until 
it ultimately comes to rest.  If we place the same object on a surface smoother than 
that  of  the  table,  the  object  would  move  a  longer  distance  on  the  surface  before 
coming to rest.

An object moving on a surface gradually slows down and comes to rest as described 
above, because the surface exerts a force on the object to oppose its motion. This 
opposing force is known as a frictional force. Friction always opposes the motion 
of an obiect.

Let us consider a situation where a table needs to be pushed along a horizontal floor 
as shown in Figure 5.1.

Figure 5.1 – Pushing a table

If  we  try  to  move  the  table  with  a  very  small  force,  it  might  not  move.   This  is 
because the floor exerts a force on the table which opposes the force that we apply. 
The  two  forces  have  equal  magnitudes  but  opposite  directions.  Therefore  they 
cancel out.

Now suppose that we slightly increase the force that we apply on the table.  If the 
table still does not start to move, it means that the frictional force exerted by the 
floor has automatically increased in order to balance the force that we applied. The  
frictional force is a force which automatically adjusts to balance the force we apply. 
However, if  we keep on increasing the force on the table, at some instant, the table 
will begin to move. This happens because the frictional force cannot automatically 
adjust beyond a certain limit. When the force that we apply exceeds that limit, an 
unbalanced force that is equal to the difference between the two opposite forces 
remains. This unbalanced force starts the motion of the table.

The  forces  that  act  between  the  surfaces  of  two  objects    in  contact  with  each 
other, to oppose the relative motion when the objects are moving relative to each 
other or, to oppose the tendency to move when the objects have a tendency to 
move relative to each other, are called frictional forces.

Frictional  forces  exist  in  the  motion  of  liquids  and  gasses  too,  However,  in  this 
lesson we discuss only the frictional forces that act between solid bodies.

5.2   Static, limiting and dynamic states of frictional forces

Frictional forces can be divided into three categories, depending on the situations 
they act on a body

They are:

1.  The frictional forces that act when there is no relative motion, even though, 

a force is applied on the body.

2.  The frictional forces that act on a body as it just begins to move. This force 
includes the small additional force that is necessary to give it a velocity.

3.  The frictional forces that act on bodies when they are in relative motion.

In  order  to  investigate  differences  among  the  three  types  of  frictional  forces 
mentioned above, let us do the following activity.

Activity 1

Items required : A block of wood weighing 60 N, a Newton balance

A block of wood 

A Newton balance

Table

Figure 5.2 – Finding the maximum frictional force exerted on the object

Procedure :

●  Fix a small ring to the block of wood and attach the balance to the ring.

●  Place the block of wood on a horizontal table and pull the block as shown in 
Figure 5.2, with a very small force. You would be able to read the magnitude 
of the applied force from the Newton balance. Initially, the force would be 
insufficient to move the block.

●  Gradually  increase  the  force  on  the  object.    When  the  force  is  gradually 
increased,  at  some  point  it  will  just  begin  to  move.    Find  the  force  at  the 
moment it just about to move.

The  body  begins  to  move  because  the  table  surface  is  not  capable  of    further 
increasing the frictional force in order to balance the force that you exerted.  In other 
words,  the  frictional  force  does  not  exceed  that  force.   The  maximum  frictional 
force exerted by the surface of the table to oppose the motion is equal to the force 
necessary to just start the motion.

Whenever the force applied on the body is smaller than this maximum frictional 
force, the surface of the table exerts a frictional force on the body that is equal and 
opposite to the applied force. This frictional force exerted on the body before the 
motion starts is called static friction.

When the applied force is gradually increased, the static friction acting on the body 
also increases with it.  However, the static frictional force can increase only up to 
a certain maximum value.  When the applied force exceeds this maximum value 
the frictional force is incapable of increasing further in order to keep the body in 
equilibrium.  Therefore the body begins to move and acquires a small velocity. This 
maximum frictional force between the surfaces of two bodies in contact with one 
another is known as the limiting frictional force between the two bodies.

The frictional force acting on the body after the body starts to move, is known as 
dynamic friction between the two surfaces.  In other words, dynamic friction  is 
the frictional force acting on bodies that are in motion.  Dynamic friction is slightly 
less than the limiting frictional force.

5.3    Factors affecting the limiting frictional force

Frictional forces act between objects that are in contact with one another.  Therefore, 
let  us  now  investigate  how  the  frictional  forces  depend  on  the  nature  and  area 
of  contact  surfaces  and  the  reaction  forces  perpendicular  to  the  contact  surfaces 
(normal reaction). 

Let us first do the following activity in order to investigate how the limiting frictional 
force depends on the nature of the contact surfaces.

Procedure :

●  Fix the block of wood with the sand paper having the lowest roughness with 

rough side facing out and completely covering the bottom surface.

●   Place the block of wood on the table so that the rough surface of the sand 
paper is in contact with the surface of the table. Next pull the Newton balance 
attached  to  the  block  with  a  very  small  horizontal  force  at  first  and  then 
increasing the force gradually.

●   When the block of wood just begins to move, record the reading of the Newton 

balance. This is the limiting frictional force. 

●  Next use a sand paper which is rougher than the first and fix it again to cover 
the bottom surface of the block, and find the limiting frictional force that is just 
enough to set the block of wood in motion.

●   Repeat the above procedure using several sand papers of increasing roughness 

and record the limiting frictional force each time.

●  Compare the results you obtained.  You will observe that the limiting frictional 
force increases gradually with increasing roughness of the sand paper used to 
cover the block of wood.

This activity shows that the limiting frictional force depends on the nature of 
the surfaces in contact.

Now let us investigate the dependence of the limiting frictional force on the surface 
area of the contact surfaces through the following activity.

Activity 3

Items required : A block of wood with a weight of 60 N and  different dimensions 
for length, width and height, a Newton balance, several pieces of

Procedure :

●  Paste the sand paper on the surfaces of the block of wood which have different 

areas.

●  Next place the surface with the largest area in contact with the table top and

force) as before.

●  Repeat  the  above  step,  placing  different  surfaces  of  the  block  in  contact 
with  the  table  as  shown  in  Figure  5.4,  to  find  the  limiting  frictional  force 
corresponding to each surface.

●  You  will  find  that  the  limiting  frictional  force  is  the  same  for  all  surfaces 
of the block of wood in contact with the table. This shows that the limiting 
frictional force does not depend on the surface area.

Our  next  activity  is  the  investigation  of  the  dependence  of  the  normal  reaction 
between bodies in contact, on the limiting frictional force.

Activity 4

Items required: Three blocks of wood each having a weight of 20 N, a Newton

Procedure :

●  As in the previous experiment, place one block of wood on the table and find 
the force required to just move the block. That is the limiting frictional force.

●  Next,  place  another    block  of  wood  on  the  first  one  and  find  the  limiting 

frictional force as before.

●  Repeat the above step with the third block placed on the other two and record 

the limiting frictional force.

This  experiment  can 
also be done by placing 
various other objects on 
the  first  block  of  wood 
instead  of 
the  other 
blocks of wood.

You will notice that the 
readings  obtained  for 
different  weights  are 
not  the  same  and  that 
the  limiting  frictional 
force 
increases  with 
increasing weights.  

That is, when the weight 
(W)  is  increased,  the 
normal reaction exerted 
on  the  weight  by  the 
table 
(perpendicular 
reaction  force  R)  also 
increases.

That is, weight of the object = perpendicular reaction force. 

This activity shows that the limiting frictional force increases when the normal 
reaction between the two forces increases.

The above activities  show that the limiting frictional force depends on the nature 
of the contact surfaces and the normal reaction between the surfaces while it does 
not depend on the area of the contact surfaces.

5.4     Practical applications of friction

Various parts of most of the machines and instruments that we use daily are in 
contact with other parts.  When we operate these machines and instruments, 
these parts slide on one another, giving rise to frictional forces.  Therefore, 
when machines are operated, an excessive amount of additional work has to 
be done against frictional forces, causing a loss of energy, This loss of energy 
appear  as  heat,  raising  the  temperature  of  the  object.    If  we  could  reduce 
frictional forces, then we would be able to minimize the energy loss and the 
rise in temperature.

Methods of reducing friction

●  Reducing the roughness of contact surfaces or polishing them.

●  Applying  lubricators  such  as  graphite,  lubrication  oil  or  grease  between  the 

contact surfaces.

●  Inserting  balls  that  could  roll  between  the  contact  surfaces.    Such  balls  can 
prevent the two contact surfaces from sliding on each other.  Ball bearings used 
to connect most of the rotating parts of vehicles and machines to stationary parts 
such as axles are fabricated in this manner.  A few different types of bearings are 
shown in Figure 5.6.

Advantages of frictional forces

Figure 5.6 – Some types of bearings

So far we discussed only some disadvantages of frictional forces and how to minimize 
them.  Sometimes friction is useful to us.  A few such examples are given below.

●  We can walk on a surface only because of the frictional force exerted by that 
surface on our feet prevents slipping. If we try to walk on a wet surface or an 
oily surface, we tend to slip and fall, due to lack of friction.

●  Grooves  are  etched  on  the  surface  of  tire  as  shown  in  figure  5.7  in  order  to 
increase the friction between the tire and the road surface.  If a sufficient amount 
of friction is not exerted on the tire, the wheels would tend to skid on the road, 
causing  accidents.  Sometimes,  when  a  motor  vehicle  is  travelling  on  mud  or 
sand,  the  wheels  tend  to  rotate  in  the  same  place,  without  moving  forward 
because the friction is insufficient for the wheels to move forward. On wet roads 
a water layer that exists between the road and the tire tends to reduce the friction 
between the two surfaces causing the vehicles to skid. The purpose of having 
grooves on the surface of  tyres is to allow water to pass through these grooves.

      Figure 5.7 – Tires with grooves to increase friction

●  Coir ropes are formed by twisting a large number of coir fibers together. Even 
when a large force is applied on a rope, the fibres do not separate because of the 
friction among them. It is easier to untie a knot made with a nylon string than 
a knot made with a coir string.  This is because the frictional forces among the 
coir fibers are stronger than those among the nylon fibers.

●  Moving vehicles can be brought to rest by applying brakes because of friction.   
As shown in figure 5.8, breaks of a bicycle operate by pressing the break-pads 
which are made of rubber on the wheel rim.  The bicycle stops because of the 
friction between the surfaces of the rubber break-pads and the wheels.

●   In modern motor vehicles, disc-breaks are used to stop the vehicle.  Such a break 
system is shown in figure 5.9.  In such systems, the frictional forces caused by 
pressing the break-pads against a disc attached to the wheel, are used to stop the 
wheels from rotating.

Summary

●  When one of two bodies in contact with one another moves or tries to move 
relative  to  the  other,  the  second  body  exerts  a  force  that  tends  to  stop  this 
relative motion.  This phenomenon is known as friction.

●  The  frictional  force  that  acts  before  the  body  begins  to  move  is  the  static 
friction.  Static friction between the bodies varies with the external force that 
tries to cause the relative motion.

●  The frictional force that acts when the relative motion between the two bodies 

just starts.

●  Limiting  friction  between  two  bodies  depends  on  the  nature  of  the  contact 

surfaces and the normal reaction.

●  Limiting friction does not depend on the surface areas of the contact surfaces.

●  The frictional force acting on a moving body is the dynamic friction.

In 1665, Robert Hooke observed a section of a cork using a microscope prepared 
by him. He discovered a structure like chambers in a beehive and he named them 
as cells.

6.2 Concept of the cell

The cell is the smallest structural unit of the organization of the living body.

The organisms composed of a single cell are called unicellular organisms and  those 
of many cells are called multicellular organisms.

For example - The transportation of oxygen is done by red blood cells.

Transmission of impulses is done by neurons. 

Accordingly, the smallest bio unit that is adapted to perform a particular function is 
the cell. So it is clear that the structural and functional unit of life is the cell.

The cells differ from one another from their shape, size and function. Except few 
occasions, mostly cells are not visible to the naked eye. Therefore they have to be 
observed using the light microscope.

All animal cells are covered by a plasma membrane or a cell membrane. It is a live 
semi permeable membrane as well as a selective permeable membrane. There is a 
centralized nucleus in an animal cell. The cytoplasm is a gelatinous material.

The outer covering of the plant cell is the cell wall . It is made up of  cellulose. 
Inner to the cell wall is the plasma membrane. At the center of plant cell is a large 
vacuole. Generally there are no such vacuoles in animal cells. 

Animal cells as well as plant cells possess different organelles that perform different 
functions.

Most  of  the  above  organelles  cannot  be  observed  through  the  light  microscope.

the cell.

 y Plasma Membrane (Cell membrane)

Plasma membrane is present interior to the cell wall of 
plant cells.The boundary of the animal cell is the plasma 
membrane. It is made up of phospholipids and proteins. 
Plasma membrane is a semi permeable membrane. The 
main function of it is to enclose the cell, allow entry of 
water,  ions,  some  molecules  and  thereby  control  the 
entry  and  exit  of  materials  into  and  out  of  the  cell. 
Plasma membrane is also known as cell membrane.

•  Cytoplasm
The  gelatinous  liquid  part  of  the  cell  excluding  organelles  is  known  as  the 
cytoplasm.  Inorganic  and  organic  substances  are  present  in  it.  The  functions  of 
the cytoplasm are to maintain a shape to the cell, bear cell organelles and carryout 
different metabolic processes.
The structures submerged in the cytoplasm are named as organnells. some organelles 
are surrounded by cell membranes. 

Eg.- mitochondrion, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, golgi complex.
²  Nucleus

    Nucleus  is  the  main  organelle  in  a  cell.  It  is 
surrounded  by  a  nuclear  envelope.  One  or  two 
nucleolus and the chromatin body are present inside 
the  nucleus.  During  cell  division,  the  chromatin 
body  converts  into  chromosome.  The  functions  of 
chromosomes  are  the  storage  of  genetic  material 
and transfer inherited characters from generation to 
generation.

 It is a fluid filled large organelle found in plant cells which is 
surrounded by a membrane. The membrane that surrounds the 
vacuole  is  known  as  tonoplast.  The  fluid  contained  in  it  is 
known as the cell sap. Water, sugar, ions and pigments store 
within  the  vacuole.  Generally  no  vacuoles  are  found  and 
sometimes  small  vacoules  may  present  in  animal  cells.
Contractile  vacuoles  can  be  found  in  unicellular  organisms. 
Maintenance of water balance, support and provision of colour

6.5 Cell Growth and Cell Division
● Cell growth 

Immature cell
Immature cell

Growth is a basic feature of organisms. Growth 
of a cell is the irreversible increase of size or 
dry  mass.  But  a  cell  has  a  maximum  limit  to 
grow.  Beyond  that  level  the  cell  will  not  grow, 
instead it divides.

Mature cell
Mature cell
Figure 6.15

● Cell division
The cell has the ability to grow and multiply its number. Accordingly a cell can 
multiply into two, four and eight cells. By multiplication new cells are formed. The 
cells multiply by cell division.

The cell division is the process by which new cells are formed by the division 
of cellular materials.

To complete the cell division of  an eukaryotic cell, first the nucleus should divide 
and then the cytoplasm.

Chromosomes contain and transfer genetic materials, the inherited characters from 
generation  to  generation  (Before  the  division  of  nucleus).  Chromosomes  can  be 
seen clearly as in the figures below.

The number of chromosomes in an ordinary somatic cell of a species is constant. 
That is specific to a species.

Example - There are 46 chromosomes in a chromosomal set of human somatic cells. 
This  is  comprised  of  23  pairs  of  chromosomes.  The  same  hereditary 
information is born by each pair of chromosomes.

A  pair  of  chromosomes  which  contains  same  hereditary  information  is  called  as 
homologous  pair  of  chromosomes.  One  of  these  homologous  chromosomes  is 
inherited from father where as the other is from mother.

Accordingly  a  child  inherits  46  chromosomes  receiving  23  chromosomes  from 
father and 23 chromosomes from mother.

The cell division takes place in 2 methods.

● Mitosis
● Meiosis

Figure 6.17

It is the type of division which multiplies 
the  number  of  cells  by  maintaining  a 
constant  number  of  chromosomes  in 
the cells. First the nucleus divides and 
then  the  cytoplasm  divides  to  produce 
two  identical  daughter  cells  equal  to 
mother cell.

Meiosis

2n

The  cell  division  that  makes  the 
number of chromosomes into half as 
the parent cell is the meiosis.    
Meiosis takes place during formation 
of gametes (eggs and sperms) in higher 
organisms.  After  the  gametes  being 
fused,  the  number  of  chromosomes 
of  a  species  should  be  maintained, 
constant.  For  that  the  number  of 
should  be  halved 
chromosomes 
during the formation of gametes and 
become n (haploid).

Meiosis  takes  place  in  2  stages.  The  first  stage  is  a  meiotic  division  (reduction 
division) and the next is a mitosis.

During meiosis, structural changes occur in chromosome. Therefore, new variations 
or new characters appear in organisms and this is a very important phenomena in 
evolution.

Significance of Meiosis

 y Maintenance of the constant number of chromosomes from generation to 

generation.

 y Help in evolution due to variations occur in chromosomes.

 y The structural and functional unit of life is the cell.
 y New cells are formed from pre-existing cells.
 y Different functions are performed by different organelles in the cell.
 y All animal cells are surrounded by the plasma membrane. Generally the 
nucleus is present at the centre of the cell. The area between nucleus and 
the  plasma  membrane  is  the  cytoplasm.  There  are  different  organelles 
present  in  the  cytoplasm.  Eg  :-  Mitochondrion,  Golgi  complex, 
Endoplasmic reticulum

 y Most  of  the  cell  organelles  are  present  in  both  animal  and  plant  cells. 
But some organelles like cell wall, chloroplast, large central vacuole are 
present only in plant cells.

 y The cellular structures that carry genetic information are the chromosomes 

in the nucleus.

 y The cell growth is the irreversible increase of dry mass or the size of the 

cell.

 y The cell divides at a particular stage during the growth.
 y The cell division takes place according to two methods. They are Mitosis 

and Meiosis.

7.1 Relative Atomic Mass (Ar)

Assignment – 7.1

Chemistry

07

Discuss with the teacher and the students in your class about the units suitable 
to measure the mass of the following.
� A motor car   
�A brick   

        � A tablet of medicine   � A helium atom

  � A molecule of carbondioxide

� A loaf of bread 

To measure the mass of items like a motor car, a brick, a loaf bread, a tea spoonful 
of sugar and a tablet of medicine, units like kilogram, gram and milligram can be 
used. But if the mass of very small particles such as a carbon dioxide molecule, or a 
helium atom is given in units like kilogram or gram, the value obtained is extremely 
small. Even the attogram (ag), the smallest units of mass is too large to indicate the 
mass of atoms or ions.

1 ag = 10-18 g

For example, the mass of an atom of the lightest element, hydrogen (H) is 1.674x10-24 g.
That  is  0.000000000000000000000001674  g.  Masses  of  some  other  atoms  are 
given below.

Mass of a carbon (C) atom    
Mass of a sodium (Na) atom   
Mass of a chlorine (Cl) atom   
Mass of a potassium (K) atom 

= 1.993 x 10-23 g
= 3.819 x 10-23 g
= 5.903 x 10-23 g
= 6.476 x 10-23 g

It is cumbersome to use this type of small figures in calculations. 

For this reason, the mass of a selected atom was taken as a unit and the masses of 
the other atoms were given relative to it. The mass so expressed is known as the 
relative atomic mass. The relative atomic mass is not the true mass of an atom of 
an element. In the past, the mass of an atom of hydrogen, the lightest element was 
used as the atomic mass unit.

7.2  Relative Molecular Mass (Mr)
Since many elements are reactive, their atoms do not exist as free atoms. They exist 
naturally as molecules formed by joining two or more atoms of them. Compounds 
are  composed  of  molecules  formed  by  the  combination  of  atoms  belonging  to 
different elements.  

How many times a given molecule of an element or a compound weighs as much 
as 1/12 the mass of C - 12 isotope is the relative molecular mass of that element or

If  the  molecular  formula  of  an  element  or  a  compound  is  known,  its  relative 
molecular mass can be calculated. This is because the relative molecular mass is 
equal to the sum of relative atomic masses of the atoms in a molecule.

For example a water molecule has two hydrogen atoms (H) and one oxygen atom 
(O) bound together. Therefore, the relative molecular mass of water (H2O) is the 
sum of the relative atomic masses of two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom.

Since  the  relative  atomic  mass  of  hydrogen  is  1  and  oxygen  is  16,  the  relative 
molecular mass of water can be calculated as follows.

In  various  tasks,  measurement  of  the  amount  of  a  substance  is  a  requirement. A 
dozen of books means 12 books. Similarly 'ream' is used to measure the amount of 
papers. 

In the SI unit system, the unit used to measure the amount of a substance is the 
mole.

The mole is the amount of a substance that contains as many basic building 
units (atoms, molecules, ions) as there are atoms in exactly 12.00 g of C – 12 
isotope. 

The number of basic units contained in a mole of any substance is a constant and it 
is equal to the Avogadro constant or 6.022 x 1023. 

Thus, the relative atomic mass of any element taken in grams contains one mole of 
atoms or 6.022 x 1023 atoms. The relative molecular mass of any substance taken in 
grams contains one mole of molecules or 6.022 x 1023 molecules.

Quantification of Elements and Compounds 

Chemistry 

A  mole  of  an  element  or  a  compound  that  exists  as  molecules  means  a  mole  of 
molecules of them.

Since mole is a unit that indicates a very large amount, it is not suitable to measure 
the amount of substances that we come across in day to day life. Therefore, the unit 
mole is practically used to measure the amounts of things such as atoms, molecules 
and ions which exist in very large numbers.

The following example illustrates the magnitude of the number representing a mole.

Suppose there are 1000 million children in the world. This in powers of ten is,  

If a mole of lozenges is equally distributed among these children,

1000 million } 1000 x 106 } 109 

The number of lozenges each child gets 

As the number of units belonging to a mole is very large, counting is impossible. 
Therefore,  other  methods  are  used  to  measure  the  mole.  One  method  to  have  a 
mole of atoms of an element is weighing out its relative atomic mass in grams. For 
example, the relative atomic mass of sodium is 23. 

1 mol of sodium atoms  = 23 g  of sodium

In order to have a mole of molecules of a given compound, its relative molecular 
mass has to be weighed out in grams. For instance, the relative molecular mass of 
glucose (C6H12O6) is 180.

1 mol of glucose molecules   = 180 g of glucose

•  Molar Mass  

Molar mass is the mass of a mole of any substance.

Though relative atomic mass and relative molecular mass have no units, grams per 
mole (g mol-1) or kilograms per mole (kg mol-1) is the unit of the molar mass.

Characteristics of organisms  08

Recall all the information and experiences you have , about organisms. Using that 
knowledge carry out the below mentioned assignment.

Assignment 8.1

Express  your  idea  about  below  instances  whether  they  are  living  or  non 
living.
1.  Hen egg
2.  A    tissue  which  is  obtained  from  an  organism  and  stored  under  special 

preservation methods

3.  A fossil about thousands of years old

How  far  the  living  characteristics  already  known  to  you  could  be  applied  to  de-
scribe a hen egg? Even after few weeks, if the egg is incubated, a chick with living 
features will be born.
A  tissue  removed  from  an  organism  can  be  stored  under  special  preservation 
methods for a longer time. Once it is bud into another organism using appropriate 
techniques, it will show living characteristics.

The  DNA  isolated  from  a  thousand  year  old  fossil  can  be  bud  to  obtain  new 
organisms with old characteristics using gene technology.

By considering above facts, you can understand that only by observing the external 
features, one cannot get a confirmation about life.

Assignment 8.2

List out the features that can be used to identify living from non living.

The features that you have listed are not always found in all living units. But all 
living units show one or few living characteristics. You can study in future lessons 
that living and non living cannot be separated by a clear line in some instances.

8.1 Cellular organization

The structure of a unicellular organism, is made up of the cytoplasm and organelles 
enclosed by a plasma membrane. This unicellular unit is an organism which shows 
living characteristics. When a water sample of a pond or hay extraction is observed 
using a microscope, unicellular organisms can be observed easily.

Euglena

Paramecium
Amoeba 
Figure 8.1 - Appearance of unicellular organisms 
through light microscope

In a unicellular organism, organelle level organization can be seen. The origin of a 
multicellular organism is from a single cell, the zygote which is the product of the 
fertilization of an egg with a sperm. The below mentioned sketch (Fig 8.2) is just to 
show the development of embryo of human.

The smallest structural and functional unit at 
living condition is the cell. A group of cells 
modified  to  perform  a  specific  function  is 
called a tissue. A collection of tissues form 
an  organ,  a  collection  of  organs  forms  a 
system,  and  systems  collectively  form  an 
organism.

8.2 Nutrition
The process by which the energy and the materials are obtained for the maintenance 
of  life  is  known  as  nutrition.  Energy  is  needed  for  the  cell  growth  and  to  repair 
the worn out structures. This energy is obtained by nutrients. The Organisms that 
produce their own food or the nutrients by themselves are known as autotrophic 
organisms.

142

For free distribution

143

For free distribution

Autotrophism  can  be  divided  into  two  categories  according  to  the  type  of 
energy  they  use  for  food  production.  If  light  energy  is  used  they  are  known  as 
photoautotrophics and if energy is obtained by a chemical reaction they are  known 
as chemoautotrophics. Most of the plants are photoautotrophic. Most bacteria are 
chemoautotrophic.  Production  of  food  inside  the  chloroplast  of  plant  cells  using 
chlorophyll, which is a specific organic compound, is called photosynthesis.
Photosynthesis can be expressed by the below equation.

Carbondioxide+ Water

6CO2 + 6H2 O 

light energy
chlorophyll

 Glucose+ Oxygen

 C6 H12 O6+ 6O2

The food produced in the leaves get stored in stems, roots and fruits. Animals are 
heterotrophic as they utilize food produced by plants or organic compounds with 
other living origins.

Below food web shows the connection between these modes of nutrition.

8.3 Respiration
All  Organisms  need  energy  for  their  metabolism.  They  obtain  this  energy  by 
breaking down of food inside the cell that they have produced or obtained by other 
means. The process by which the stored food is transformed into energy inside 
the cells is known as cellular respiration.
Cellular respiration is a series of biochemical reactions. The respiration, which is an 
important characteristic of life, cannot be observed directly. But it can be observed 
using respiratory movements of some organisms. That is by inspiration, intake of 
oxygen for respiration and removal of carbon dioxide, the expiration.
Using  the  below  experiment  it  can  be  shown  that  CO2  is  released  while  O2  is 
absorbed during respiration.

Method
Arrange the apparatus as shown above and remove water in bottle E.

When water is removed, an air flow occurs from bottle A to bottle E.

The colour of limewater in B does not change as CO2 in air that enters through P 
dissolves in KOH of vessel A. But after some time the limewater in vessel D turn 
to milky. It is because of the released CO2 by the frog during respiration. A control 
experiment can be used without a frog in C. Accordingly it is confirmed that CO2
is released as a byproduct of respiration. This experiment can be conducted again 
using germinating green gram / paddy/ maize/ bean seeds in vessel C instead of a 
frog.

Now we will carry out the experiment below to show the absorption of O2 during 
respiration.

Figure 8.9- A practical demonstration to show absorption of oxygen in respiration

Method
Close the  flask with the cork lid connected to a rubber tube and a U tube as shown 
in  the  diagram. After  sometime  tighten  the  rubber  tube  and  observe  the  water 
level in the U tube.  

when the flasks are closed with cork lids air inside is released through the rubber 
tube and pressure comes to equilibrium. Then rubber tubes are tightened to avoid 
gas exchange.
CO2 released during respiration of seeds in apparatus A dissolves in KOH. O2 in the 
flask is absorbed by the seeds for respiration. To fill that gap, (reduction in volume 
of air) air in the tube flows into the flask. The water column in the glass tube is 
drawn up. So it is clear that O2 is absorbed for respiration of organisms. No such 
change in B setup as absorbed volume of O2 is equal to the released volume of CO2.
Two assumptions are made in this experiment.
(i) Volume of  CO2 in the flasks is negligible.
(ii) In respiriation, absorbed volume of O2 is equal to the released volume of CO2

the 
Organisms 
changes 
the  environment.  When 
there  is  a  change  in  the  internal  and 
external environment or a stimulus with 
a particular strength, organisms respond 
accordingly.  A  change  which  is  strong 
enough  to  bring  about  a  response  is 
known  as  a  stimulus.  The  stimuli  are 
detected  by  organs  such  as  eye,  ear, 
nose,  tongue  and  skin.  The  stimuli  are 
light, sound, chemicals and mechanical 
or physical vibrations. 

Figure 8.10- Responding towards stimuli

The reactions according to the changes in the environment are known as responses. 
Eg: The stimulus is the sound and the response is closing of ears with hands as in 
the above diagram 8.10. 

The ability to respond to stimuli receives from internal or an external environment 
is  known  as  irritability.  The  communication  between  different  organs  during 
responding to a stimulus is known as co-ordination. Nerves, muscles and hormones 
are important in co-ordination. Some insects fly towards light, some fly towards 
dark. Not only animals but also plants respond to stimuli.

Example : 

Leaves of Mimosa fold when touched. That means those plant   
leaves are sensitive to touch. Leaves of Thora, Tamarind and   
Sesbania fold at night. That means these plant leaves  
are sensitive to light.

8.5 Excretion
All  organisms  obtain  materials  from  the  environment  and  transform  them  to  a 
beneficial form of energy. At the same time the materials which are not used and 
the waste materials that are produced during the processes in the body are released 
to the environment. 

The sum of chemical and physiological activities or building up and breaking 
down of materials within the cell are known as metabolic activities. Removal of 
the    waste  products  from  the  body  that  are  produced  during  metabolism  is 
known as excretion.

Figure 8.11- Different ways of excretion of a living being

The main excretory materials of organisms are urea, salts, CO2 and water. There are 
organ systems present in the organism body for excretion. Nitrogenous excretion of 
human mainly takes place by the kidney.
Plants release CO2 during respiration, O2 during photosynthesis through lenticels 
and stomata of the leaves. That can be referred to as excretion too.

       For extra knowledge.
•  Anabolism
The  process  of  synthesis  of  complex  compounds  from  simple 
compounds  within  the  living  body.  Energy  is  stored  during  this 
process.
 ² Catabolism
The  process  of  breaking  down  complex  compounds  into  simple 
compounds in the body releasing energy is known as Catabolism.
 ² Metabolism
Summation of bio chemical reactions taking place in the living body 
or the total of anabolism and catabolism is known as Metabolism.

8.6 Movement 
Organisms  fulfil  their  requirements  (food,  protection,  reproduction)  with  the 
help of movement. During this, the whole organism or a part of the organism is 
moved.  Unicellular  organisms  use  cilia,  flagella  or  pseudopodia  for  movement.

Multicellular organisms move the whole body or a part of the body with the help of 
muscles. Most of them possess organs for locomotion.

E.g :- Fins, Wings, Legs

Similarly the organelles within the cell have the ability to  move. Movement is a 
living characteristic of organisms and it is essential for their existence.

You may have observed the growth of a shoot tip of a potted plant towards light 
which is placed closer to a window. The shoot apex of a plant grows towards light 
and the root apex towards the gravity. 
Organisms move as a response to stimuli. The stimuli may vary.

Examples : 

Light/darkness, Chemical substances, Gravitational force
Heat/temperature, Vibrations/touch

Assignment 8.4

 ² State different modes of locomotion of mammals and give two examples for 

each.

 ² For what purposes do organisms locomote?
 ² Give examples for different growth movements of plants.

8.7 Reproduction
What happens to the existence of the earth, if all the organisms die without producing 
their own offsprings? If so, the populations become extinct with time, one by one.
Therefore before one generation dies, they have to produce their next generation. 
Production of a new generation by a unicellular or a multicellular organism 
for the continuation of their species is known as reproduction.
Reproduction is of two types. They are sexual and asexual reproduction. During 
sexual  reproduction,  gametes  of  two  individuals  sperm  and  an  egg  of  the  same 
species  unite  to  form  a  zygote. The  first  cell  of  the  process  of  producing  a  new 
organism is the zygote. 
During  asexual  reproduction,  a  single  organism  can  produce  an  identical  new 
offspring without the contribution of another organism.

Example : Propagation of new plants by vegetative structures of plants
8.8 Growth and Development
The life of multicellular plants or animals starts from a single cell. Tissues which 
are modified to perform a specific function arise by the division of the above single 
cell, zygote.
The zygote which is the result of the sexual reproduction of human develops into an 
embryo within the uterus and later transforms into an offspring. It is useful to study 
about the above process to understand the growth and development.

Mainly  the  increase  in  number  of  cells  by  the  cell  division  contributes  towards 
the  growth  of  a  multicellular  organism. The  growth  of  a  unicellular  organism  is 
considered  as  the  increase  of  the  size  and  the  volume  of  the  cell.  (Paramecium, 
Yeast,  Chlamydomonas)  The  cell  growth  means  the  irreversible  increase  of  dry 
mass of the cell. Development means, the increase in the complexity of the cell. 
Accordingly, growth and development can be expressed in three steps.

1. Irreversible increase in size of the cell
2. Increase in number of cells by cell division
3. Cell differentiation
Auxanometer can be used to show the growth of a plant.

According  to  the  above  mentioned  features,  now  you  can  identify  living  or  non 
living things in the environment. 

Observe  a  white  thread  like  mass  on  a  pile  of  decomposing  garbage.  It  is  the 
somatic part (growth part) of a fungus. Later it transforms into mushrooms which 
are structures of sexual reproduction.

You can observe Lichen grows on a coconut trunk, ferns and orchids grow on a 
wall, mealy bugs on chili or papaw plants, small, fragile white eggs on leaflets of 
Sesbania and identify their living or non living nature.

Sometimes,  living  or  non  living  nature  of  some  substances  cannot  be  identified 
easily. Bacteria cells can be dried into a powder. Yeast which is a fungus that is used 
to make bread is available in the market as a dried powder.

Assignment 8.5

Some  non  living  things  show,  living  features  in  the  environment.  Formations 
of rocks by aggregation of soil, growth of crystals are some examples. Waves 
appear in reservoirs show a movement. Discuss how this movement and growth 
is different from that of living organisms.

Some living entities cannot be easily identified whether they are living 
or non-living.

shapes  and  sizes  have  been 
identified.

Viruses  do  not  possess  any  organelles  for  metabolic  reactions. A  virus  becomes 
active only inside the host cells.

       For extra knowledge.

The only living feature of virus is the 
reproduction.  When  a  virus  reaches 
an appropriate host  it hydrolyzes the 
cell  membrane  of  the  host  cell  and 
releases its RNA or DNA into it. The 
nucleic  acid  then  multiplies  within 
the host cell or produces thousands of 
viral particles.  A virus activity like an 
organism in this manner can only be 
seen inside a host cell.

through electron microscope

Common plant viral diseases are banana bunchy top disease and curly leaf of chilies. 
Some animal viral diseases are influenza, common cold, Dengue and AIDS. It is 
important to prevent those diseases by knowing about them.

Organisms live in environments in which they can maintain their life. Therefore we 
can protect them by conserving those environments.

You should have the ability to differentiate living from non living after studying 
the above lesson. You should respect every organism in the environment as they 
are part of the environment. Spend little time daily to study about the environment. 
Try to keep a daily record about them. If possible try to keep a environmental 
diary. Collect relevant information from your teacher.

Summary

•  Cellular organization, Nutrition, Respiration, Irritability and coordination, 
Excretion,  Movement,  Reproduction,  Growth  and  Development  are 
characteristics of organisms.

•  The  basic  organizational  level  of  an  organism  is  the  cell.  Multicellular 
organisms possess tissues, organs and system level complex organization.

•  The process of obtaining energy and material to maintain the life is known 

as nutrition.

•  The cellular respiration is the process by which the end products of digestion 

combine with  oxygen to produce energy inside the cell.

•  The ability to respond to the changes in the external or internal environment 
is known as irritability. The adaptation of the body functions according to 
those changes is the coordination.

•  Removal  of  waste  products  of  metabolism  out  of  the  body  is  termed 

excretion.

•  Organisms move as a result of coordination.

•  Production of new generation for the continuation of their species is termed 

reproduction.

•  The  growth  is  the  irreversible  increase  of  dry  mass  of  a  cell.  During 

development, cells differentiate to perform a particular function.

•  Virus is an acellular form which cannot be differentiated into living or non 

living.

•  All  organisms  contribute  to  maintenance  and  the  existence  of  the 

environmental balance.

9.1 The resultant of several forces

Figure 9.1 shows a motor car stalled on the road due to a mechanical fault being 
pushed  by  one  person  in  the  forward  direction.  Since  the  force  exerted  was  not 
sufficient to move the vehicle, it did not move. Figure 9.2 shows two people trying 
to push the car. The motor car did not move in this attempt either. In Figure 9.3, 
three people are shown to push the motor car. In this attempt, the car has moved.

Figure 9.1 – One person pushing a car

Figure 9.2 – Two persons pushing the car

Figure 9.3 – Three persons pushing the car

In order to move the car all the forces have to be applied in the direction that the 
car needs to be moved.

If  many  people  take  part  in  pushing  the  car  instead  of  just  one  person,  all  the 
individual forces combine to form a larger force in the same direction and the task 
becomes easier.

The result of many people exerting forces in the same direction is that all the forces 
add up to give a larger single force.

When more than one force is applied, the single force that gives the 
same  result  as  that  of  all  the  contributing  forces  is  known  as  the 
resultant force of the individual contributing forces.

Forces applied on objects can have various directions. In this lesson will discuss 
about,

(i)  the resultant of two collinear forces (forces having the same 'line of action')                       

and

(ii)  the resultant of two parallel forces (forces having parallel but different 'line 

of action')

9.2 Resultant of two collinear forces

Resultant of two collinear forces acting along the same direction

When pulling on fishing nets, the task can be accomplished more easily if a large 
group of people take part in pulling the net in the same direction. Because all the 
forces act in the same direction, the fishing net can be successfully pulled.  Here, all 
the forces are applied in the same direction and along the same line.

Now let us investigate a way of finding the resultant of two collinear forces acting 
along the same direction.

Activity 1

Items required : a trolley, three Newton balances, two pulleys, a ring

Place the trolley on a table and fix the ring to one side of the trolley and attach 
two strong strings to the ring as shown in Figure 9.5.  Pass the two strings over 
the two pulleys and connect the two Newton balances B and C to the other ends 
of the strings.  Fix the other end of the trolley to a wall through the third Newton 
balance A.

 ● Apply two forces from the two Newton balances B and C.  Record the readings 

of the balances.

 ● Record also, the reading of the balance A.

 ● Find  a  relationship  between  the  reading  on  the  balance  A  and  the  readings 

recorded from B and C balances. 

 ● Applying different forces from the B and C, repeat the activity several times 

and find the relationship between the measurements.

You will observe that the sum of the readings of B and C is equal to the reading of A.

       That  is,  when  two  collinear  forces  act  along  the  same  direction,  the 
resultant of the two forces is equal to the sum of the two individual forces
with a direction in the direction of forces.

Example 1

Two children are pulling a thread connected to a box placed on a table in the same 
direction.  The force applied by one child is 8 N while that of the other child is 6 N.  
What is the resultant force with which the children are pulling the box?

The resultant force applied by both children    = 8 N + 6 N 

8 N 6 N

    = 14 N

Resultant  of  two  collinear  forces  acting  along  opposite 
directions

Have  you  seen  the  national  sport  of  pulling  ropes  during  the  Sinhala  new  year 
season?  The participants of such competitions form two groups and pull a rope 
in two directions.  The rope will be dragged in the direction of the resultant force 
which lies in the direction of the larger force.

Figure 9.6 – Pulling a rope

When we want to pull an object along a certain direction, the resultant force or the 
net force of forces applied along that direction is given by the summation of the 
forces.

The result of applying forces in various directions is a non-utilization of the forces 
productively.

It is possible to obtain a large net force only if all the contributing forces are applied 
in the same direction.

It is an experience that in order to drag a heavy object along the floor easily, the 
object should be pushed from behind and pulled from the front.

Go carts used to carry children can be pulled from the front or pushed from the back 
in order to move it.  If both a pull from the front and a push from the back are given 
to the go cart, moving the cart would be easier as a large resultant will operate on 
the cart.

Now let us find the resultant of two collinear forces acting in opposite directions.  
In order to do it, let us engage in the following activity.

Activity  2

Figure 9.7 - Forces acting in opposite directions on a trolley
 ● Place the trolley on a table as shown in Figure 9.7 and fix two pieces of string 
to the two ends of the trolley. Allow the other ends of the pieces of string to 
pass over the two pulleys and attach two Newton balances A and B.

 ● Record your observations on the motion of the trolley after applying a 4 N 

force on each balance.

 ● Record your observations on the motion of the trolley after applying a 4 N 

force on the balance A and a 6 N force on balance B.

 ● Repeat the above step applying a 6 N force on the balance B and a 6 N force 

on the balance A.

You will observe that the trolley does not move in the first case.  The trolley remains 
in  equilibrium  under  the  action  of  the  two  equal  forces  acting  on  it  in  opposite 
directions.  

In the second instance, the trolley moves in the direction of the Newton balance 
B.  Here, there are two inequal forces acting on the trolley in opposite directions 
and the trolley moves in the direction of the larger force. The extra force which is 
applied in the direction of A than in the direction of B is 2 N. That is, in this instance 
the resultant is 2 N in the direction of B. 

In the third instance, the trolley does not move. Here, the resultant is zero since the 
two forces acting in the opposite directions become equal.

When two collinear forces are exerted on an object in opposite directions, 
the resultant is given by their difference, with a direction in the direction of 
the larger force.

Example 1

What is the magnitude and the direction of the resultant of a force of 5 N pulling an 
object placed on a table in a certain direction and another force of 2 N pulling it in 
the opposite direction?

          Resultant force = (5 N) + (-2N)

     = 3 N

The object will be pulled by a force of 3 N in the direction of the 5 N force.

9.3 Resultant of two parallel forces

Let us now investigate instances where two parallel forces which are not collinear 
are in action, and how to find the resultant of these two parallel forces.

Let us consider this example.

150 N

Figure 9.8 – One person trying to push a 
motor car

150 N
200 N

Figure 9.9 – Two persons pushing the car

One person is trying to push 
a  motor  car  with  a  force  of 
150  N  in  the  direction  as 
shown  in  Figure  9.8,  but  it 
has not moved.

However, when the assistance 
of  another  person  pushing 
the car with a force of 200 N 
was obtained and the car was 
pushed  by  both  persons,  in 
the  direction  shown  the  car 
moved.    It  was  because  the 
resultant of the two forces is 
sufficient  for  the  motion  of  
the car.

Although  both  these  forces  were  applied  in  the  same  direction,  they  are  not 
collinear.  They are two parallel forces acting on two different points of the motor 
car. However, that when two forces act along the same direction the resultant is the 
sum of the two forces.

Resultant of the two forces        = 150 N + 200 N (since both forces act in the same 

direction) 

                                                      =  350 N   

To experimentally check that the resultant of two parallel forces are equal to their 
sum, let us do the following activity.

Items required :  a strip of wood with three holes drilled as shwon in the figure, 

three Newton balances

 ● Drill three holes X, Y and Z on the strip of wood as shown in the figure below 
and  attach  the  three  Newton  balances  A,B  and  C.  Pull  the  three  balances 
keeping  the  strip  of  wood  to  be  in  a  rest  position.  (Always  keep  the  strip 
perpendicular to the Newton balances. you may need to apply equal forces on 
the A and B balances)

A

Y

Figure 9.10 - Finding the resultant of two 
parallel forces

 ● When the strip of wood is at rest, you would observe that the sum of the readings 
of the Newton balances A and B is equal to that of the Newton balance C. What 
is the reason for this?  It is because the resultant of the two forces on A and B is 
equal to the magnitude of the force on C.

In order to find the resultant of two parallel forces acting along the same 
direction, the two forces must be added.

One of the best uses we can get from a knowledge of resultant force is to make use 
of a large number of small forces in place of a single large force effectively.

of motion of the object lies in a direction between the two forces.

Summary

 ● The single force acting in place of many forces (the single force that gives the 

same result as many forces) is known as the resultant force.

 ● The magnitude of the resultant of two forces acting in the same direction is 
the  sum  of  the  two  forces.  Direction  of  the  resultant  is  the  direction  of  an 
individual  forces.

 ● If  the  magnitudes  of  two  collinear  forces  acting  in  opposite  directions  are 
different,  then  the  magnitude  of  their  resultant  is  equal  to  the  difference 
between the two forces and acts in the direction of the larger force.

 ● The resultant of two inclined forces act in a direction which lies between the 

two forces.

The  English  alphabet  contains  26  letters. Yet,  the  combination  of  them  forms  a 
large number of words. There is only a limited number of elements. In spite of that, 
millions of compounds are formed by their chemical combination. 

Though most of the elements form chemical compounds, there are some elements 
which do not form compounds under normal conditions. Helium, neon and argon 
are examples. These elements occurring as single atoms in nature exist as gases. 
They are known as noble gases.

What is the reason why many elements form compounds but not the noble gases? 
This can be explained by taking into consideration the electronic configuration of 
elements.

The  outermost  shell  carrying  electrons  in  an  atom  of  an  element  is  known 
as  its  valence  shell.The  valence  shell  of  the  atoms  of  neon  and  argon  has  eight 
electrons each. This electronic structure has been identified as a stable electronic 
configuration. Because of this stable configuration their reactivity is very low, so 
they are referred to as noble gases. But, the state of sodium and chlorine atoms is 
different. In order to have the stable noble gas configuration, a sodium atom has to 
either lose the electron in the last shell or gain seven electrons. Similarly a chlorine 
atom can attain the stable electronic configuration by receiving a single electron or 
by removing seven electrons. In the atoms of these element, electrons in the valence 
shell  reorganise  to  acquire  the  stable  electronic  configuration.  That  means,  loss, 
gain or sharing of electrons occurs.

The  attractive  forces  or  binding  among  the  atoms  or  ions  resulted  by  the 
rearrangement  of  electrons  in  the  valence  shell  for  stabilizing  the  atoms  of 
elements as described above are called chemical bonds. 

According to the way the participating atoms behave when they chemically bind 
together, the chemical bonds can be divided into two types.

The electronic configuration of the sodium atom is 2, 8, 1. Sodium is an element

positive and negative ions produced by the exchange of electrons among atoms 
are  known  as  ionic  bonds  or  electrovalent  bonds.  So,  sodium  chloride  is  a 
compound with ionic bonds. Such compounds are called ionic compounds.

Fig 10.6 shows how electrons in the outermost energy levels of the atoms reorganize 
during the formation of sodium chloride.

The attractions among the ions in the compound sodium chloride is not limited to a 
single pair of Na+ and Cl- ions. Owing to the attractions, a large number of positive 
and  negative  ions  arrange  themselves  to  form  a  regular  three  dimensional  array 
where six Na+ ions surround every Cl- ion and six Cl- ions surround every Na+ ion. 
This arrangement gives rise to the crystal lattice of sodium chloride known as an 
'ionic lattice' (Fig. 10.7). In all ionic compounds the ions are organised in a three 
dimensional lattice.

10.2  Covalent Bonds
Electron sharing between atoms is another method of forming bonds among them. 
By  sharing  of  electrons  like  this,  the  atoms  acquire  the  noble  gas  configuration. 
Joining of atoms by sharing electrons between a pair of atoms is referred to as a 
covalent bond. 

Sharing  of  electrons  between  atoms  of  the  same  kind  gives  rise  to  homoatomic 
molecules.
e.g. hydrogen (H2), fluorine (F2), oxygen (O2), nitrogen (N2) 

Sharing of electrons between atoms of different elements gives rise to heteroatomic 
molecules.

e.g. water (H2O), methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3)
a). Fluorine molecule 
The electronic configuration of a fluorine atom is 2, 7. By sharing a pair of electrons, 
two fluorine atoms acquire the stable electronic configuration. The result of this is 
the bonding of two fluorine atoms covalently to form a fluorine molecule (Fig.10.8).

Chemical Bonds

In the ammonia molecules nitrogen atom is the central atom and hydrogen atoms 
are the peripheral atoms. There are three bond pairs and a single lone pair in the 
valence shell of the ammonia molecule.

In all the molecules given above, the central atom as well as the peripheral atoms 
have acquired the noble gas configuration. That means, except in hydrogen, a set 
of eight electrons is completed in the valence shell of atoms after the formation of 
the bonds. Those are known as the  compounds in which the octet of electrons is 
complete.
Nevertheless, there are exceptions too. Let's take aluminium chloride (AlCl3) as an 
example. In this, the electronic configuration of the aluminium atom is 2, 8, 3. The 
electronic configuration of a chlorine atom is 2, 8, 7. Three chlorine atoms share 
three pairs of electrons with an aluminium atom to form an AlCl3 molecule.

 In this molecule, the valence shell of the aluminium atom contains 
six electrons. In the case of a chlorine atom, the octet is complete.

In  contrast,  there  are  instances  where  the  octet  of  electrons  in  the 
valence shell is expanded. Phosphorus penta chloride (PCl5)  is an example. The 
electronic configuration of phosphorus is 2, 8, 5. The electronic configuration of 
chlorine is 2, 8, 7. A phosphorus atom and five chlorine atoms 
share  five  pairs  of  electrons  to  form  the  PCl5 molecule.Then 
there  are10  electrons  around  the  central  phosphorus  atom.  In 
each chlorine atom, the octet is completed.

atoms are covalently bonded are known as atomic lattices. Carbon naturally occurs 
as  two  forms  of  atomic  lattices,  graphite  and  diamond.  They  are  known  as  the 
allotropic  forms  of  carbon. These  two  forms  differ  in  the  way  the  carbon  atoms 
form covalent bonds with one another. Generally the melting points and  boiling 
points  of covalent compounds are low. But in diamond and graphite, the melting 
point and boiling point are high due to their atomic lattice structure.

 y Graphite

Chemical Bonds

Graphite consists of layers of carbon atoms formed by the joining of one carbon 
atom with three other carbon atoms by single bonds. These layers are superimposed 
on one other. The forces holding these layers are weak. Thus one layer can easily 
slide over the other. Because of this structure, graphite behaves as a lubricant.

Diamond 

Diamond is a three dimensional lattice in which every carbon atom forms four 
single bonds with four other carbon atoms. Diamond is the hardest substance 
found in nature. 

10.3  Polarity of Bonds 

Electronegativity is the tendency of an atom to attract electrons of a chemical bond 
towards itself. It takes different values for different atoms. Then hydrogen molecule 
is  formed  by  the  joining  of  two  hydrogen  atoms  of  equal  electronegativity  by  a 
covalent  bond. The  distribution  of  electrons  in  the  bond  pair  of  this  molecule  is 
symmetrical.  Therefore,  the  hydrogen  is  a  non  –  polar  molecule.  But  when  two 
atoms of different electronegativities are joined by a covalent bond, the attraction 
imposed by the two atoms on the bond pair is different. Let us take hydrogen fluoride 
molecule as an example. Since fluorine is more electronegative than hydrogen, the 
bond pair is more displaced towards the fluorine atom. So, the electron distribution 
is not symmetrical. Consequently the fluorine atom bears a small negative charge. 
This is known as polarization. However the molecule HF as a whole is a neutral 
molecule.

Chemistry 

Chemical Bonds

When two atoms of unequal electronegativities are joined by a covalent bond, it 
gets polarized due to asymmetric distribution of electrons. Such bonds are called 
polar covalent bonds.

In  case  where  two  atoms  of  similar  or  slightly  different  electronegativities  are 
joined by a covalent bond, the bonding electrons between those two atoms distribute 
symmetrically. Such covalent bonds are referred to as non – polar covalent bonds.

In the water molecule, there are four pairs of electrons in the valence shell of its 
oxygen atom. Of them two pairs are bond pairs and two pairs are lone pairs.

When an O – H bond of a water molecule is considered, the bond pair shifts more 
towards  the  more  electronegative  oxygen  atom.  Thus  the  molecule  is  polarized  
so that the oxygen atom bears a partial negative charge while the hydrogen atom 
carries a partial positive charge. Hence water is a compound with polar covalent 
bonds.

In three dimensional space water molecule is disposed as follows. It assumes an 
angular shape (Fig. 10.19).

10.4 Intermolecular Bonds
In water molecules the hydrogen atoms which bear a very small positive partial 
charge forms attractive forces with oxygen atoms bearing a very small negative 
charge of the neighbouring water molecules. This kind of attractions among the 
molecules are known as intermolecular forces or intermolecular bonds.

These intermolecular forces are not as strong as the covalent bonds between the 
oxygen atoms and the hydrogen atoms in a water molecule. Yet, these intermolecular 
forces impart many special properties to water.

Because of these intermolecular forces, water exists as a liquid at room temperature. 
In case that there were no intermolecular forces among the water molecules, water 
is a gas at room temperature.

Some  special  properties  possessed  by  water  due  to  attractive  forces  among  the

The bulb lights in the circuits with common salt and copper sulphate solutions. It 
doesn’t light in the circuits with the sugar solution and distilled water. Common salt 
and  copper  sulphate  are  compounds  with  ionic  bonds.  Hence,  aqueous  solutions 
of ionic compounds conduct electricity. Sugar and water are covalent compounds. 
Electricity does not flow through them. Experiment shows that even common salt 
in the fused state conducts electricity. This confirms that electricity flows through 
ionic compounds in aqueous solution and fused state. However electricity does not 
flow through ionic compound in solid state.

Turning effect of a force 11

Physics

11.1 Moment

We have seen that by applying forces on objects, it is possible to push, pull or lift 
them.  Similarly, it is possible to rotate objects by applying forces on them. That 
is, by applying a force we can rotate or turn an object around a given point.  In this 
lesson, we will focus our attention on the ability of a force to rotate an object around 
a given point.

Let  us  do  the  following  activity  in  order  to  investigate  the  factors  affecting  the 
rotation of an object.

Activity 1

Mark  four  points  A,  B,  C,  D  on  the 
same  horizontal 
level  of  a  door 
attached  to  its  frame  by  two  hinges.  
Attach a Newton balance to the point 
A with the aid of a rubber sucker clamp 
and  apply  a  perpendicular  force  on 
the door to open it. Measure the force 
necessary  to  slightly  move  the  door 
using the Newton balance.  Repeat this 
procedure for the other three points B, 
C and D and record your measurements 
in Table1 11.1 given below.

of the door 

Figure 11.2 – Axis of 
rotation of the door

Here,  the  door    rotates  around  an  axis  passing  through  the 
hinges as shown in Figure 11.2.  This axis is known as the 
axis of rotation of the door.

It would be clear to you that the force required to rotate the 
door decreases when the perpendicular distance to the line 
of action of the force from the rotation axis is increased.  It 
would  also  be  clear  to  you  from  your  measurements  that 
the  force  required  to  rotate  the  door  increases  when  the 
perpendicular distance to the line of action of the force from 
the rotation axis is decreased.

This means that it is easier to open the door when the applied 
force is further away from the rotation axis, while it is more 
difficult  to  open  when  the  applied  force  is  closer  to  the 
 rotation axis. 

It is clear from the above activity that the force required to rotate an object around 
an axis depends on the perpendicular distance to the force from the axis.

The product of the force and the perpendicular distance to the line of action of the 
force from the axis of rotation is known as the moment of the force around the 
axis.

In order to subject a body to a motion in a straight line, a force is required.  In order 
to rotate an object around a given axis, what is required is not just a force but a 
moment. A moment required to rotate an object is created by applying a force at a 
certain distance from the rotation axis.  This tendency for rotation due to the action 
of a force is known as the turning effect of the force.

Therefore, we can write an equation for the moment due to a force as defined below.

 Moment due to  =    force   ×   perpendicular distance from the rotational axis to the  

 a force

The unit of moment of a force is N m.

Since the moment is a tendency for rotation, depending on whether the rotation is 
clockwise or anticlockwise, the moment too has to be clockwise or anticlockwise.

 ● Investigation of the dependence of the moment on the magnitude 

of the force.

Let us carry out the following activity in order to investigate the dependence of the 
moment on the magnitude of the force.

 ● Now attach a loop formed with a piece of wire to each of the holes at A, B, C 
and D on the stick.  Attach the Newton balance on the ring at D as shown in 
figure 11.4 and measure the minimum force necessary to barely move the stick, 
keeping the balance perpendicular to the stick.  The axis of rotation in this case 
is the axis passing from the centre of the nail head down through the nail.

 ● Next, rotate the nail half a turn to tighten the stick a little more and measure the 

force required to slightly move the stick.

 ● Again, rotate the nail half a turn to tighten the stick further and measure the 

force required to slightly move the stick.

 ● Tabulate your measurements. What is the result that you have expected ?

Suppose you obtained the results shown in the table below.  (You may obtain values 
different to the values given depending on your set up.)

You will see that the force required to initiate the turning effect increases as the 
stick is tightened. Since the distance to the line of action of the force is maintained 
constant this confirms that the moment depends on the magnitude of the force.

Investigation  of  the  dependence  of  the  moment  on  the 
perpendicular distance to the force from the point of suspension. 

In order to investigate how the moment depends on the perpendicular distance to 
the force from the point of suspension, let us do the following activity.

Activity  3

 ● As shown in Figure 11.5, insert a loop made from a piece of thread around 
the stick of wood used in Activity 2 near the point A and hook the balance on 
the loop. Rotate the screw by one turn to bring it back to its original position.  
Find  the  force  required  to  initiate  rotating  the  stick  slightly.  Suppose  this 
force is F1.

●  Now rotate the screw by about ¼ th of a turn to tighten it.

●  Then, move the loop together with the balance slowly towards D, keeping the 

force F1 constant.

●  When the stick begins to move around O, measure the distance x2 from O to 

the balance.

●  Repeat  the  procedure,  tightening  the  screw  by  another  ¼  th  of  a  turn  and 
sliding the loop towards D, keeping the force (F1) constant and measure the 
distance x3 from O to the balance when the stick begins to rotate around O.

●  Tabulate your measurements.

The above results show that when the force necessary to initiate the turning effect 
is kept constant, perpendicular distance to the Newton balance had to be increased 
as the strip is tightened
This confirms that the moment of force also depends on the perpendicular distance 
to the force from the point of suspension.

Direction of the moment of force and equilibrium of object 
under the action of the moments of force.

When a force acting on an object, depending on the direction of rotation, moments 
can be classified as clockwise or anti - clockwise.

Consider two forces F1 and F2 exerted on a stick clamped at the point O as shown 
in the figure 11.6

clockwise  moment = F1 × d1

anti - clockwise moment = F2 × d2
When the two forces are applied in the same time, 
the resultant moment  = F1 × d1 - F2 × d2 
Here, clockwise moment is considered as positive.
If the opposite moments are equal, (that is F1 × d1 = F2 × d2 ) the object will not 
rotate, and it will be in equilibrium.

11.2    The couple of forces
To rotate an object with a single force that object must be pivoted to a fixed point. 
It is possible to rotate an object that is not pivoted, with the use of two forces acting 
in opposite directions.

Consider  the  case  of  a  strip  of  wood 
being pierced at the center and fixed with 
a screw to a table as shown in the figure. 
Attach  a  Newton  balance  as  shown  and 
measure the force (F) when the rod begins 
to rotate slightly.

Next,  attach  two  Newton  balances  at 
both ends A and B and measure the force 
required to slightly rotate the rod.  If the 
force required with one force had been F, 
the  force  required  when  two  forces  are 
applied  in  opposite  direction  would  be 
F/2.  Note  that  the  two  forces  act  on  the 
same plane (coplaner). 

From the above activity, it would be clear 
to you that when applying forces to rotate 
or turn an object around a certain axis it 
is easier to rotate by applying two equal 
forces in opposite directions.

Figure 11.7 - Demonstration of couple 
of forces

Two coplanar forces of equal magnitudes acting in opposite directions, along two 
lines of action that are spaced apart are known as a couple of forces.

When a couple of forces is applied on an object, the resultant of the two forces is 
zero as the two forces of equal magnitude and act in opposite direction.  Therefore, 
a couple of forces does not cause a linear displacement in an object.  However, the 
object rotates around a point between the two forces.

The moment of a force couple is defined as the product between the magnitude of 
one force and the perpendicular distance between the lines of actions of the two 
forces.

The unit of the moment of a couple of forces is N m. 

Moment of a couple of forces = F x d
Where F  =    force

  d  =  perpendicular  distance 
  between  the  lines  of 
                      action of the two forces

If we want to rotate an object by a single force as done by attaching one Newton
balance  to  the  point  A  and  pulling  the  object  as  in  the  example  above,  then  the 
object has to be pivoted at a certain point.  (What happens here is the formation of a 
force couple due to the action force we apply and the reaction force generated at the 
pivot according to Newton’s third law.)  However, it is possible to rotate even a free 
object by applying a force couple as done in the example of applying two forces at 
points A and B with two Newton balances

Applications of couple of forces 

When opening or closing a tap, a couple of forces acts on the 
tap head.

Figure 11.8 - tap

When unscrewing or tightening nails with a screw 
driver as shown in Figure 11.9  we apply a couple 
of forces on the handle of the screw driver.

Summary

●   What is meant by the moment of a force is the tendency of an object to rotate 
      as a result of a force acting on it.

●    The  moment  of  a  force  is  given  by  the  product  between  the  force  and  the
     perpendicular distance to the line of action of the force from a selected axis.

  That is,

Moment due to a force = force  x  perpendicular distance to the line of action 
                                                     of the force from a selected axis.

●    A couple of forces is a pair of two equal forces that are parallel to one another    

and acting in opposite directions on an object so as to turn or rotate it. 

●  A couple of forces can rotate an object without causing a linear motion in the
      object.

12.1    Introduction to equilibrium of forces

Figure 12.1 – Two groups pulling a rope
In a competition of pulling a rope, two groups pull the rope in two opposite directions.  
When the force exerted in one direction becomes greater than the force exerted in 
the other direction, the rope moves in the direction of the larger force.  When both 
groups pull with equal forces, the rope will remain at rest without moving in either 
direction. The sum of the two forces becomes zero. In this situation the rope is said 
to be in equilibrium under the action of the forces in the two directions.

Another  such  instance  is  shown  in  Figure 
12.2.  It  shows  an  object  suspended  by  a 
spring balance.  

Here  there  are  two  forces  acting  on  the 
object. One force is the weight of the object 
which arises due to the gravitational force.  
The other is the upward force exerted by the 
spring  of  the  balance  in  order  to  keep  the 
object from falling onto the ground.  Under 
the  action  of  these  two  forces,  the  object 
remains  at  rest.    That  is,  the  object  is  in 
equilibrium under the two forces.

A sphere suspended by a string is shown in Figure 12.3.  The 
weight  of  the  sphere  is  acting  vertically  downwards.    The 
sphere remains at rest as the vertically upward force applied 
by the string, balances the force due to its weight (The force 
applied by the string is called its tension). In this instance, the 
sphere remains in equilibrium under the downward force due 
the weight (W) and the upward force (T) exerted by the string.

In daily life, we come across situations where various forces 
act  on  objects  quite  frequently.    Objects  can  remain  in 
equilibrium under two, three or even many forces.

Figure 12.3 – A sphere

Here we will consider instances where objects remain in equilibrium under two or 
three forces.

12.2    Equilibrium of a body under two forces

We  learnt  about  the  effective  force  or  the  resultant  force  of  two  collinear  forces 
(forces acting along the same line) acting on a point, in the lesson on resultant force.

In that lesson, you have learnt that, while a certain force is acting on an object, if it 
is pulled by another force in the opposite direction, the magnitude of the resultant 
force decreases. When an object is said to be in equilibrium, what is meant is that 
the resultant force of the two forces acting on the object is zero.

Now let us investigate the factors required to keep an object in equilibrium under 
two forces acting in opposite directions along the same line. 

Let us do activities 1 and 2 for this purpose.

Activity  1

Items required : a ring, two spring balances

 ● Place  the  ring  horizontally  on  a  table  and  pull  it  with  the  two  balances  in 
opposite directions as shown in Figure 12.4.  By varying the extent of the pull, 
apply forces of varying magnitudes on the object.  In each attempt, the ring 
must be kept at rest.

 ● The ring stays at rest only when it is in equilibrium under the action of the two 
forces in opposite directions.  Every time the ring is in equilibrium, you will 
observe that the readings of the two spring balances are equal.

That is, at equilibrium, the two forces are equal in magnitudes.

Now  try  to  maintain  equilibrium  without  having  the  two  forces  along  the  same 
line.  You will find that this is impossible.  That is, every time the two forces are in 
equilibrium, they must be aligned along the same line and their directions must be 
opposite to one another.

Activity  2

Items required : a cubic shaped block of wood, two Newton balances, two rings    

to fix the balances to the wooden block

 ● Fix the two rings to the centers of two opposite faces of the block of wood as 

shown in Figure 12.5.

 ● Now attach the two Newton balances to the two rings and pull the block of 

wood along the two directions applying forces of various magnitudes.

Figure 12.5 – Pulling a block of wood in two directions

You will observe that the block of wood moves in one direction whenever there is a 
nonzero resultant force and that it remains stationary whenever the resultant force is 
zero.  That is, every time the block of wood is in equilibrium, the two forces acting 
on it in opposite directions have equal magnitudes.

Figure 12.6 – A book in equilibrium on a table

In this case, the weight of the object, acting vertically downwards, is balanced by 
the perpendicular reaction force exerted vertically upwards by the table.  That is, 
the object is in equilibrium under the action of the two forces mentioned above and 
the object remains at rest. 

If  an  object  suspended  by  a  string  as  shown  in  Figure  12.7 
remains in equilibrium, the reason is that a force equal to the 
weight  of  the  object  is  acting  vertically  upwards  along  the 
string.  The force exerted upwards by the string is known as 
the tention of the string.  As the object is held in equilibrium 
by two forces - its weight and the tension of the string - the 
object remains at rest.

In  each  of  the  instances  described  above,  only  two  forces  were  acting  on  the 
object.    In  addition,  the  two  forces  were  equal  in  magnitude  and  opposite  in 
direction.  Also, their lines of action were the same. That is, for an object to remain 
in equilibrium, the following conditions must be satisfied.

1.

3. 

The two forces must have equal magnitudes.

The two forces must act along two opposite directions.

12.3  Equilibrium of a body under three coplanar parallel 

forces

A  bunch  of  banana  suspended  on  a 
light horizontal rod is shown in Figure 
12.8.  Here,  the  rod,  the  two  strings 
used to suspend it and the string used 
to suspend the bunch of banana are all 
in  the  same  plane.  Also,  all  three 
strings are parallel.  This is an example 
of  a  system  in  equilibrium  under  the 
action  of 
three  parallel,  coplanar 
forces.  (There are four forces acting in 
the system if the weight of the rod is 
considered.  However, by a "light rod" 
we mean a rod whose weight is negligibly small. Therefore, we do not consider that 
force here.)

Figure 12.8 – Bunch of banana suspended on a 
horizontal rod

A  rod  resting  on  two 
supports  is  shown  in 
Figure  12.9.    In  this 
system  of  forces,  the 
three forces, the weight 
of  the  rod  and  the  two 
perpendicular  reaction 
forces  exerted  on  the 
rod  are  coplanar  and 
their lines of action are parallel to one another.  Under these forces, the rod is in 
equilibrium on the two supports.

Figure 12.10 - Equilibrium of a meter ruler under three coplanar parallel forces

 ● Measure the weight of the meter ruler.  Next, suspend it at the two ends with 
the aid of the rubber bands and balances as shown in Figure 12.10 and keep 
the meter ruler in equilibrium in a horizontal position.  Take measurements of 
the two spring balances.  The system is now in equilibrium under the action 
of three parallel, coplanar forces.

 ● Investigate  the  relationship  between  the  measurements  of  the  two  spring 
balances and the weight of the meter ruler.  You will notice that the sum of 
the two readings of the balances is equal to the weight of the meter ruler.
 ● That  is,  the  sum  of  the  two  forces  exerted  on  the  meter  ruler  by  the  two 

balances is equal to the weight of the meter ruler.

 ● See whether it is possible to push the meter ruler in a horizontal plane with 
a  force  applied  normal  to  the  meter  ruler  at  one  end  of  the  ruler  and  still 
maintain equilibrium.

 ● You will understand that every time the meter ruler is in equilibrium, the two 

balances and the meter ruler are in the same plane. 

That  is,  in  order  for  an  object  to  maintain  equilibrium  under  the  action  of  three 
parallel forces, the following conditions must be satisfied.

(i)  The three forces must be coplanar.
(ii)  One force must have a direction opposite to the other two forces.
(iii) The resultant of any two forces must be equal in magnitude and opposite in 

direction to the third force.

A child sitting on a swing is an example for a system in equilibrium under three 
parallel forces.  The child can remain in equilibrium on the swing, since the sum of 
the two forces F1 and F2 exerted by the two ropes is equal to the weight of the child 
as shown in Figure 12.11.

Figure 12.12 - A framed picture hanging on the wall

A framed picture like the one shown in Figure 12.12 remains at rest because the 
tensions  of  the  two  strings  (F1  and  F2)  and  the  weight  of  the  picture  (W)  are  in 
equilibrium.  Although these three forces are coplanar, they are not parallel to one 
another as in the examples described earlier.

Let  us  now  engage  in  the  following  activity  to  find  out  the  factors  necessary  to 
maintain equilibrium in a system of three forces that are coplanar, but not parallel 
to one another.

Activity  4

Items required : a thin rectangular laminar, a string

You may use a thin sheet of metal or a piece of cardboard as the laminar.  Hang 
your laminar from three points, one at a time as shown in Figure 12.13 and 
mark the verticle line that goes along the string, on the laminar each time.

Figure 12.13 - Finding the centre of gravity of the laminar  
² The point of intersection of the three lines can be considered as the center of 

gravity of the laminar.

	 Center of gravity is the point at which the whole weight of a body may be 
considered to act. Therefore, the weight of the laminar acts along the verticle 
line that goes through its centre of gravity.

²  Hang the laminar using two strings connected to it, as the framed picture 
shown in Figure 12.12 and keep it in equilibrium in a vertical plane.

²  Mark the lines of each string on a sheet kept behind the laminar. Mark also, 

the vertical line passing through the center of gravity.

  All  three  lines  marked  above  will  lie  on  the  same  plane  and  they  will  pass 

through a common point.

²  Now, keeping the position of one of the three forces fixed, turn the laminar to 
change the plane of the other forces. You will observe that, the system remains 
equilibrium only after readjusting the lines of action of the forces so as to have 
all three forces lying on the same plane.  

That is, in order for a system of three non parallel  forces to be in equilibrium, the 
three forces must be coplanar.  Also, the lines of action of the three forces must 
meet at a common point.  Furthermore, the resultant of any two of the forces should 
be equal to the third force in magnitude, and opposite in direction.

So  far  we  have  only  discussed  systems  that  are  in  equilibrium  under  the  action 
of two or three forces.  Equilibrium can exist under the action of more than three 
forces.  Figure 12.14 shows a system in equilibrium under five forces.

It shows a plank of wood suspended by four strings attached to the four corners.  The 
plank of wood maintains equilibrium since its weight acting vertically downwards 
is balanced by the forces of tension exerted by the four strings.

force of 20 N.  In order to bring the object to rest, what is the force that 
should be applied on it in the direction opposite to the 20 N force?

(ii)  What would happen if a force of 25 N is applied on the above object in the 

opposite direction?

Summary

² 

If the magnitudes of two collinear forces applied on an object are equal 
and they have opposite directions, then the object is in equilibrium. 
²  An  object  under  three  parallel  forces  is  in  equilibrium  if  one  force  is 
equal in magnitude to the resultant of the other two forces and it is in the 
opposite direction.

eg;  

²  If an object stays in equilibrium under three forces that are not parallel 
to  one  another,  when  the  resultant  of  any  two  of  the  forces  is  equal  in 
magnitude and opposite in direction to the other force. 

resultant

When the resultant of the two forces A and B is applied in the dirction of the 
force C, the three forces will be in equilibrium.

²  Even under the action of more than three forces, a system can remain in 

equilibrium by applying forces appropriately.
