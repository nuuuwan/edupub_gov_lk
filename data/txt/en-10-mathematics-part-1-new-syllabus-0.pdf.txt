While doing the above exercise you would have recalled facts on finding the
perimeter of some basic plane figures as well as of compound figures.
Now let us consider the perimeter of sectors of circles.
Sector of a circle
The region which is shaded in this figure is a portion of a
circle with centre C which is bounded by two radii and a
part of the circumference. Such a portion is called a
which is the angle
sector of a circle. The angle θ
between the two radii is called the angle at the centre.
The angle at the centre can take any value from 0o to 360o.
• The sector that is obtained when the angle at the
centre is 180o is a semi-circle.
• The sector that is obtained when the angle at the
centre is 90o is a quarter of the circle.
1.1 Finding the arc length of a sector of a circle
Arc length
The figure illustrates a sector of a circle of radius r. Such a sector is called a sector
of radius r and angle at the centre θ. Let us now consider how the arc length of such
a sector of a circle is found.
Let us first find the arc length of a semi-circle of radius r.
We know that the circumference of a circle of radius r is 2πr.
Therefore, due to symmetry, the arc length of a semi-circle of radius r is given by
Here, the reason for taking the arc length of the semi-circle to be πr, that is, the
value of 2πr divided by 2, is the symmetry of the circle. The expression πr for
the arc length of a semi-circle of radius r can be obtained by reasoning out in the
following manner too.
Let us consider a circle and a semi-circle, both of radius r.
The angle at the centre of the circle is 360o. The arc length
corresponding to this angle is the circumference of the circle
which is 2πr.
Now let us consider the semi-circle.
The angle at the centre of the semi-circle is 180o, which is
360o. Therefore, the arc length of the semi-circle should be of
the arc length of the circle.
That is, the arc length of the semi-circle is
Writing this in more detail,
the arc length of the semi-circle
In the same manner, since the angle at the centre is 90o for a sector which is
the circle,
arc length of a sector which is
of the circle
Reasoning out in this manner, an expression can easily be obtained for the arc
length of a sector of a circle of radius r with angle at the centre θ x.
Arc length
The circumference of the circle = 2πr
Arc length =

Observe the 1st and 2nd columns of the table. If the length of the arc of the circle can
be identified from the figure as a fraction of the circumference, then the length of
the arc can easily be found. When the angle at the centre is in degrees, this fraction

Accordingly, it should be clearer to you now that the length of an arc with angle at
the centre θx and radius r is
« 2πr.
Now let us consider several examples.

1.2 Finding the perimeter of a sector of a circle
To obtain the perimeter of a sector of a circle, the arc length and the lengths of the
two radii by which the sector is bounded should be added together.
That is,
Arc length perimeter of the sector = arc length + radius + radius
= arc length + 2 « radius
Therefore,
the perimeter of a sector of a circle of radius r with angle at the centre θ

the centre 120o. Find its perimeter.

1.3 The perimeter of plane figures containing sectors of circles
Let us see how the perimeter of plane figures containing sectors of circles is found
by considering several examples.
Example 1
20 cm
14 cm
The figure illustrates how a semi-circle has been joined to a
rectangle of length 20 cm and breadth 14 cm such that the
breadth of the rectangle is the diameter of the semi-circle.
Find the perimeter of this figure.
Since the arc length of a semi-circle of radius r is
the arc length of the semi-circle of radius 7 cm
The perimeter of the figure = 20 + 20 + 14 + 22
= 76 cm
Example 2
15 cm
15 cm
The figure represents a square lamina of side length
15 cm. If the shaded sector (AGB) and the triangular
portion (GEF) are cut out, find the perimeter of the
portion (BCDFG) that is left over.
Perimeter of BCDFG is BC + CD + DF + FG + arc length GB
First let us find the length of FG.
Let us apply PythagorasZ theorem to the right angled triangle GEF.
Next let us find the arc length GB.
Since the angle at the centre of the sector ABG is 90o,
Finally let us find the length of BC and DF.
BC = 15 − 7 cm
= 8 cm
DF = 15 − 6 cm
= 9 cm
Perimeter of BCDFG = BC + CD + DF + FG + arc length GB
= 8 + 15 + 9 + 10 + 11
= 53 cm
∴ The perimeter of the remaining portion of the lamina is 53 cm

Summary
• The arc length of a sector of a circle of radius r with angle at the centre θx is given
• The perimeter of the sector is given by
Square Root
By studying this lesson you will be able to
• approximate the square root of a positive number which is not a perfect square
• use the division method to find an approximate value for the square root of a
positive number which is not a perfect square.
2.1 The square root of a positive number
You have earlier learnt some facts about the square of a number, and the square root
of a positive number. Let us briefly recall what you have learnt.
The value of 3 « 3 is 9. We denote 3 « 3 in short by 32. This is read as ‘three
squared’. The ‘2’ in 32 denotes the fact that two threes are multiplied ‘twice’ over.
Accordingly, three squared is 9 and this can be written as 32 = 9.
The squares of several numbers are given in the following table.
Number How the square of the
number is obtained
1 × 1
2 × 2
3 × 3
4 × 4
5 × 5
How the square
of the number is
denoted
Square of the
number
Numbers such as 1, 4, 9, 16 are perfect squares.
Finding the square root is the inverse of squaring. For example, since 32 = 9, we say
that the square root of 9 is 3. It will be clear to you, according to the first and last
columns of the above table that
the square root of 1 is 1,
the square root of 4 is 2,
the square root of 9 is 3,
the square root of 16 is 4
and the square root of 25 is 5.
The symbol
is used to denote the square root. Accordingly we can write
It is clear that every number has a square. However, does every positive number
have a square root? Let us investigate this.
According to the above table, the square root of 4 is 2 and the square root of 9
is 3. The square root of a number between 4 and 9 is a value between 2 and 3.
Accordingly, it is clear that the square root of a number between 4 and 9 is not an
integer. It is a decimal number. In this lesson we will consider how an approximate
value is found for this. We call such a value an approximation.
Let us for example consider how an approximate value is obtained for the square
root of 5.
Consider the following table.
Number How the square
of the number is
found
How the square
of the number is
written
The square of the
number
2 × 2
2.1 × 2.1
2.2 × 2.2
2.3 × 2.3
2.4 × 2.4
2.5 × 2.5
2.6 × 2.6
2.7 × 2.7
From the values in the right hand side column, the two values that are closest to 5
are 4.84 and 5.29. They are the squares of 2.2 and 2.3 respectively. According to the
above table, the square roots of 4.84 and 5.29 are respectively 2.2 and 2.3. This can
be written symbolically as
Now let us examine which value from 4.84 and 5.29 is closer to 5.
The difference between 4.84 and 5 = 5 – 4.84 = 0.16
The difference between 5.29 and 5 = 5.29 – 5 = 0.29
Accordingly, the value that is closer to 5 is 4.84. Therefore, 2.2 can be taken as an
approximate value for the square root of 5. The value that is obtained for the square
root of a positive integer which is correct to the first decimal place is called the
“approximation to the first decimal place” of the square root of the given number
(or more simply the “first approximation”)
Accordingly, the approximation of square root of 5 to the first decimal place is 2.2.
When an approximate value is given, the symbol is used. Accordingly, we can
write
By providing reasons in a similar manner, we can conclude that the approximation
of square root of 6 to the first decimal place is 2.4 and the approximation of square
root of 7 to the first decimal place is 2.6
That is,
By considering the following examples let us now learn a specific method of finding
the first approximation of the square root of a positive number which is not a perfect
square.
Example 1
to the first decimal place.
Approximate
• From the perfect square numbers which are less than 17, the one which is closest
to it is 16, and from the perfect square numbers which are greater than 17, the one
which is closest to it is 25.
Accordingly, let us write
16 < 17 < 25
• When we write the square root of each of these numbers we obtain.
Accordingly, the square root of 17 is greater than 4 which is the square root of 16,
and less than 5 which is the square root of 25.
i.e.,
lies between 4 and 5.
• To find an approximate value close to
16 or to 25.
, let us check whether 17 is closer to
The difference between 16 and 17 is 1.
The difference between 17 and 25 is 8.
17 is closer to 16 than to 25.
is a value close to 4.
i.e., one of the values 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 can be the first approximation of
• Let us now multiply each of these numbers by itself to identify the number which
has a product which is closest to 17.
When the first two values are squared we obtain
Since the value of 4.22 exceeds 17, it is unnecessary to find 4.32 and 4.42.
16.81 is the closer value to 17 from these two.
First approximation of
is 4.1
Example 2
Find the first approximation of
Since 152 = 225 and 162 = 256,
write
Accordingly,

Since 245 is closer to 256 than to 225,
is closer to 16 than to 15.
The first approximation of
Let us now determine this value.
can be one of 15.5, 15.6, 15.7, 15.8 and 15.9.
15'9 x 15'9 = 252'81
15'8 x 15'8 = 249'64
15'7 x 15'7 = 246'49
15'6 x 15'6 = 243'36
From the above values, 246.49 is closest to 245.
First approximation of
is 15'7'
Exercise 2.1
Find the first approximation of each of the following numbers.
2.2 The Division Method
Let us now consider a method of finding the square root of any positive number.
This method is called the division method. Let us study this method by considering
several examples.
Example 1 Find the square root of 1764.
Step 1
Separate 1764 as shown below, by grouping the digits of 1764 in pairs, starting
from the units position and proceeding towards the left.
17 64
Step 2
Find the perfect square number which is closest to the leftmost digit or pair of digits
of the separated number, and as indicated below, write its square root above and to
the left of the drawn lines.
Step 3
Write down the product 4 x 4 of the number above and to the left of the lines, below
the number 17 as indicated, and subtract it from 17.
Step 4
Now carry down the next two digits 64, as indicated below.
Step 5
Next, write on the left as shown below, the digit 8, which is two times the number
above the line, leaving space for another number to be written. (i.e., leave space for
the digit in the units position)
Step 6
The same digit should be written above the line to the right of 4 and in the space left
in the units position on the left. This digit should be selected so that the product of
this digit and the number obtained on the left when this digit is written in the units
position (in this case 82), is equal to 164, or is the closest number less than 164 that
can be obtained in this manner.
When finding the square root of a decimal number, separate the digits in pairs on
both sides of the decimal point, starting at the decimal point as shown below.

Fractions
By studying this lesson you will be able to
• identify situations in which fractions are applied
• solve problems involving fractions.
Fractions
The figure depicts a slab of a certain type of chocolate.
It has been divided into ten equal sized pieces such
that the pieces can easily be broken off.
When the whole slab of chocolate is considered as one unit,
● one piece of chocolate that is broken off is considered as
of the slab,
● two pieces of chocolate that are broken off is considered as
of the slab,
● three pieces of chocolate that are broken off is considered as
of the slab.
etc., which are used to represent portions of a whole unit, are examples
of fractions.
Now let us consider another example.
The above figure depicts how pieces of cheese have been arranged in a container.
There are 8 equal pieces. One of the pieces has been removed from the container.
This piece is of the amount of cheese in the container. If the total mass of all the
pieces of cheese in the container is 160 g, then the piece that was removed which is
of the total quantity of cheese in the container, is of mass 20 g.
The unit that has been considered here is the total mass of the cheese in the container
which is 160 g.
When talking about fractions, it is important to be aware of the unit from which the
factions are obtained.
For example, in the statement “ of all the students in the class are girls”, the
is applied by taking “the total number of students in the class” as the
fraction

In the following table, the units relevant to several statements involving fractions

The circular shape illustrated in the following figure has been divided into 6 equal
parts. We know that the fraction that has been shaded is of the shape.
The denominator of
is 6 and the numerator is 2. The total number of parts into
which the unit has been divided is the denominator, and the number of parts being
considered is the numerator. Here, the numerator is smaller than the denominator.
Such fractions are called proper fractions. Fractions such as
numerator equal to 1 are called unit fractions.
In the following figures, quantities equal to
of the same unit have been
shaded. Here the area of the rectangle has been taken as the unit.
It is clear from the above figures that
Further, considering fractions such as
and the denominators are not, as the denominator increases, the value represented
by the fraction decreases. That is,
, where the numerators are equal
The following figure illustrates the three fractions
obtained from the
same unit.
According to the figure, the quantities represented by the three fractions are equal.
That is,
Such fractions which are equal to each other are called equivalent fractions.
Observe that fractions which are equivalent to a given fraction are obtained when
both the numerator and the denominator are multiplied by the same number.
For example,
Equivalent fractions are also obtained when the numerator and the denominator of
the given fraction are divided by the same number.
For example,
Now let us consider the two fractions
obtained from the same unit, which
are unequal to each other.
First let us write down several fractions which are equivalent to each of the fractions
It can be observed that among the fractions which are equivalent to

done above with equivalent fractions,
It is clear from the figure too that
Accordingly, it is clear that it is suitable to write equivalent fractions having a
common denominator when comparing fractions.
Now let us consider the addition and subtraction of fractions.
You have learnt in earlier grades to add fractions with equal denominators, as for
example
Similarly, you know that fractions with equal denominators can be subtracted as
for example,
When adding and subtracting fractions of unequal denominators, the relevant
fractions can first be converted into equivalent fractions of equal denominators.
For example,
Fractions can also be used to represent quantities which are greater than a unit.
For example, let us see what quantity of a loaf of bread is. This is the amount
that is obtained when a loaf of bread is divided into two equal parts and three such
parts are considered. This quantity is one and a half loaves of bread. That is,
loaves of bread, which in short, is a quantity of
As another example, let us illustrate
of a circle by a figure.
If these three figures are considered together as one unit instead of separately, then
the shaded region represents
of the unit. However, if any one of these circles
is taken as the unit, then the shaded region represents
of the unit. It is clear
therefore that the mixed number
can also be written as the fraction
Another way in which the equality
can be obtained is given below.
Accordingly, it is clear that
. When this amount is denoted by
, it is
called a mixed number. When it is written as
, it is called an improper fraction.
You have learnt in previous grades how a mixed number is converted into an
improper fraction and how an improper fraction is converted into a mixed number.
Now let us recall what has been learnt about multiplying fractions. To do this, let us
draw figures in the following manner to find out how much
According to the figure, it is clear that
is equal to
The above answer can be obtained by simplifying this in the following manner too.
It is clear that ‘of’ in
and that the numerator can be taken as 1 « 3 and the denominator as 2 « 4'
denotes the mathematical operation multiplication
Now let us consider the situation of dividing fractions.
Let us find how many
the following figure that this value is 2.
there are in
. This is denoted by
. It is clear from
As another example, let us obtain half of
According to the figure, half of
is equal to
However, since half of any quantity, is the amount that is obtained when the quantity
is divided by 2,
It is not convenient to draw figures every time we divide fractions. We need to
identify a different method to do this. The above division of fractions which was
done using figures, can also be presented in the following manner.
^Since 2 =
(Multiplying by
which is the same as dividing by 2)
That is, the same answer that was obtained with the figures is obtained using this
method too.
Let us see whether this method works for
That is, the same answer that was obtained with the figures is obtained here.
When the numerator and the denominator of the fraction
are interchanged we
obtain
' We say that the reciprocal of
; that is 6.
The reciprocal of a general term
In general, when a fraction needs to be divided by another fraction, the first fraction
can be multiplied by the reciprocal of the second fraction.
Let us recall all the facts that have been learnt so far regarding fractions by working
out the following example.
The order in which the mathematical operations are
manipulated when simplifying fractions, is as follows:
B – Brackets
O – Of
D – Division
M – Multiplication
A – Addition
S – Subtraction

4.1 Product of two binomial expressions
What you simplified in 3(b) above is the product of two binomial expressions of
the form x + a. In this lesson, we will learn about expanding the product of two
binomial expressions of the form ax + by. Here, ax and by are the two terms of the
binomial expression ax + by.
Example 1 Expand and simplify (3x + 2)(2x + 3).
The result that was obtained above can also be illustrated using the areas of
rectangles. (All the measurements below are assumed to have been given in the
same units).
2x 3x x 2x = 6x2
2x x 2 = 4x
3x x 3 = 9x
3 x 2 = 6
For the rectangle ABCD,
length of AB = 3x + 2
length of AD = 2x + 3
Area = (3x + 2) (2x + 3)
According to the figure,
Area of the rectangle ABCD = The sum of the areas of the four smaller rectangles
= 6x2 + 9x + 4x + 6
= 6x2 + 13x + 6
It is clear according to (1) and (2) that,
(3x + 2) (2x + 3) = 6x2 + 13x + 6

The fruit seller states that if the number of apples that are bought is increased
by 5 fruits, he can reduce the price of each apple that is bought by 3 rupees.
Accordingly, the child decides to buy 5 more apples.

4.2 Squares of binomial expressions
Let us turn our attention again to the following expressions which you expanded in
the above exercise.
Do you notice that the two binomial expressions to be multiplied are equal?
(x + 2) (x + 2) , (x – 3) (x – 3), (5x – 2y) (5x – 2y)
In the same manner that we write x × x = x2, we can write (x + 2)(x + 2) = (x + 2)2.
Similarly,
(x – 3) (x – 3) = (x – 3)2
(5x – 2y) (5x – 2y) = (5x – 2y)2
Each of these expressions written in the form (x + 2)2, (x – 3)2 and (5x – 2y)2 is
called the square of the respective binomial expression.
The same method that was used above to simplify the product of two binomial
expressions can be used to expand such squares of binomial expressions too.
Example 1
Write (x + 2)2 as a product of two binomial expressions and expand it.
Simplifying the square of a binomial expression can be done using another method
Now let us consider how the squares of binomial expressions of the form (a + b)
and (a – b) are expanded.
It is important to remember this as a formula.
(a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2
Square of the first term
Square of the second term
Two times the product of the first
and second terms
Now let us consider the expansion of (a − b)2
That is, (a − b)2 = a2 − 2ab + b2
Note : The expansion of (a − b)2 can also be obtained by substituting − b for b in
the expansion of (a + b)2
i.e., (a + (− b))2 = a2 + 2(a) (− b) + (− b)2 = a2 − 2ab + b2
Also,
You may have observed that the expansions of (a + b)2 and (–a – b)2 are equal to
each other and that the expansions of (a – b)2 and (–a + b)2 too are equal to each
other.
Now study how the following squares of binomial expressions have been expanded.

Congruence of Triangles
By studying this lesson you will be able to
• recognize the congruence of two plane figures
• identify the necessary conditions for two triangles to be congruent
• prove riders by using the congruence of triangles
Congruence of two plane figures
If we examine the above figures we see that they are all closed plane figures
consisting of straight line segments. Such figures are called rectilinear plane figures.
The sides and the angles are called the elements (parts) of these figures.
The pairs of rectilinear plane figures presented below in figures (i) to (iv), which
are identical in shape and size can be placed on each other such that they coincide.
(iii)
A pair of plane figures which may be made to coincide is called a pair of congruent
plane figures. In this section we concentrate on the congruence of pairs of triangles.
5'1 Congruence of two triangles
A triangle has six elements. They are the three sides and the three angles of the
triangle.
Let us assume that the two triangles ABC and PQR given below are congruent.
Let us also assume that, when the two triangles are placed one on top of the other
such that they coincide, then AB coincides with PQ, AC coincides with PR and BC
coincides with QR. Then we say that, in the two triangles, the side corresponding
to AB is PQ, the side corresponding to AC is PR and the side corresponding to BC
, the angle
is QR. Similarly, we say that the angle corresponding to
corresponding to
and the angle corresponding to
Accordingly, in congruent triangles, the corresponding elements are equal to each
other.
ZZ' For
We indicate the fact that two triangles are congruent by using the symbol zz
example, if the two triangles ABC and PQR are congruent, we indicate this fact by
writing
It is not necessary to show that the six elements of one triangle are equal to the six
elements of the other triangle as indicated above to show that a pair of triangles is
congruent. It is sufficient to show that three of the elements are equal. However,
this does not mean that if any three elements of one triangle are equal to three
elements of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent. In certain cases,
when three elements of one triangle are equal to three elements of another triangle,
then the remaining elements too are equal and the triangles are congruent. There are
four such cases. Let us now consider these four cases.
(a) First Case
The case in which two sides and the included angle of one triangle are equal to two
sides and the included angle of another triangle
Activity
Three triangles with two sides of length 2'5 cm and 3'5 cm and an angle of magnitude
30o are given below.
2'5 c
3'5 cm
3'5 cm
2'5 c
3'5 cm
2'5 cm
² Copy the triangle ABC onto a tissue paper and cut it out.
² Examine whether the cut out triangle can be made to coincide with the triangles
PQR and LMN.
² Accordingly, select the triangle which is congruent to the triangle ABC.
It must be clear to you through the above activity, that only the triangle PQR is
congruent to the triangle ABC. Both the triangles PQR and LMN have three elements
which are equal to the given three elements of the triangle ABC. However, the
triangle ABC is only congruent to the triangle PQR. It should be clear to you from
this that, just because two triangles have three elements which are equal to each
other, it does not mean that the triangles are congruent.
Let us consider another method by which we can identify that the triangle ABC is
congruent to the triangle PQR but not to the triangle LMN. The 30o angle of the
triangle ABC is the included angle of the sides of length 2.5 cm and 3.5 cm. It is the
same for the triangle PQR. However the 30o angle is not the included angle of the
sides of length 2.5 cm and 3.5 cm of the triangle LMN. Two sides and the included
angle of triangle ABC are equal to two sides and the included angle of triangle PQR.
But this cannot be said about the triangles ABC and LMN. There is insufficient
data to state that and ABC and
are congruent.
which is 30o is called the included angle of the sides
is the included angle of the sides PR and PQ
Note: Here the angle ACB
AC and CB. Similarly, the angle RPQ
of the triangle PQR.
This result which you discovered through the above activity has been used as an
axiom of geometry from ancient times.
If two sides and the included angle of one triangle are equal to two sides and the
included angle of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent.
Showing that two triangles are congruent in the above manner is mentioned in short
as being congruent under the case SAS.

according to the above mentioned case using the given data as follows.

based on the information that is given. From these pairs of triangles, select the

elements which are equal to each other.

(ii) the lines AD and BC are parallel to each other.
Now let us consider the second case by which the congruence of two triangles can
be identified.
(b) Second Case
The case in which the magnitudes of two angles and the length of a side of a triangle
are equal to the magnitudes of two angles and the length of a corresponding side
of another triangle
Activity
Consider the triangles given below.
2'5 cm
2'5 cm
2'5 cm
² Copy the triangle ABC onto a tissue paper and cut it out.
² Place it on the triangles PQR and LMN and examine which triangle it coincides
with.
² Accordingly, which triangle is congruent to the triangle ABC?
It must be clear to you according to this activity that the trianlge ABC is congruent
only to the triangle PQR.
In this case too, as in the case (a), the two triangles PQR and LMN have three
elements which are equal to three elements of the triangle ABC. However, although
the triangle ABC is congruent to the triangle PQR, it is not congruent to the triangle
LMN. As before, it should be clear to you from this that, just because two triangles
have three elements which are equal to each other, it does not mean that the triangles
are congruent.
Therefore, let us consider another method by which we can identify that the triangle
ABC is congruent to the triangle PQR. The given side of length 2.5 cm is opposite
the given 30o angle of the triangle ABC. It is the same for the triangle PQR. However
it is not the same in the triangle LMN. Accordingly, two angles of triangle ABC is
equal to two angles of triangle PQR, and one side of triangle ABC is equal to the
corresponding side of triangle PQR. However, the corresponding side of triangle
LMN is not equal to that of triangle ABC.
Note: Here, corresponding sides are defined as those which are opposite equal
angles of the two triangles.
If two angles and a side of one triangle are equal to two angles and the corresponding
side of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent.
Showing that two triangles are congruent under these conditions is stated
concisely as being congruent according to the AAS case.
Using the given data, we can show as done below, that the triangles STU and LMN
in the following figure are congruent according to the case mentioned above.

Therefore
Example 2
Determine whether the following pair of triangles is congruent under the case AAS.
Two angles of the triangle ABC are equal to two angles of the triangle PQR. Also,
AB = PQ. However, they are not corresponding sides. The reason for this is that the
and PRQ
angles ACB
which are opposite these two sides are not equal to each other.
& Therefore, there are insufficient
reasons to say that the two triangles ABC and PQR are congruent to each other by
the case AAS.
Exercise 5.2

congruence based on the given information. For these pairs, prove that the two

Let us consider the third case by which the congruence of two triangles can be
identified.
(c) Third Case
The case of three sides of a triangle being equal to three sides of another triangle
Can a unique triangle be constructed when the lengths of the three sides of the
triangle are given? To determine this, engage in the following activity.
Activity
Break off pairs of ekel sticks of lengths 5 cm, 6 cm and 7 cm respectively. Make
two triangles of side lengths 5 cm, 6 cm and 7 cm with these pieces. Do you see
that the two triangles have to be congruent? By changing the positions of the pieces
of ekel in one triangle, can you create a triangle which is not congruent to the other
triangle? It must be clear to you that this is not possible.
This result which you established through the above activity can also be used as an
axiom.
If the three sides of a triangle are equal to the three sides of another triangle, then
the two triangles are congruent.
Showing that two triangles are congruent under these conditions is stated concisely

If the lengths of the hypotenuse and a side of a right-angled triangle are equal to the
lengths of the hypotenuse and a side of another right-angled triangle, then the two
triangles are congruent.

Factors of Quadratic Expressions
By studying this lesson you will be able to
• find the factors of trinomial quadratic expressions,
• find the factors of the difference of two squares.
Factors of algebraic expressions
We know that 2x + 6 is a binomial algebraic expression. Since it can be expressed
as 2(x + 3), we also know that 2 and x + 3 are its factors.
Similarly, since 4x2 + 6x = 2x (2x + 3), we know that 2, x and 2x + 3 are the factors
of 4x2 + 6x.
Now let us find the factors of a2 – 2a + ab – 2b
a2 – 2a + ab – 2b = a (a – 2) + b (a – 2)
= (a – 2)(a + b)
Therefore, the factors of a2 − 2a + ab − 2b are a − 2 and a + b.
Do the following exercise to further recall what has been learnt earlier about
factoring algebraic expressions.

Defining trinomial quadratic expressions
Now let us consider factoring quadratic expressions such as x2 + 2x – 3. This
expression is of the form ax2 + bx + c. Here a, b and c take integer values.
We call an algebraic expression of the form ax2 + bx + c, where a, b and c are
non-zero, a trinomial quadratic expression in x. a is said to be the coefficient of
x2, b the coefficient of x and c the constant term. It is easy to find the factors of
such an expression when the terms are written in this order. The coefficient of
x2 in x2 + 2x – 3 is 1 while the coefficient of x is 2 and the constant term is – 3.
4 + 2x – x2 is also a trinomial quadratic expression. To find its factors it can be
written in the order – x2 + 2x + 4.
When the trinomial quadratic expression x2 + 2xy – y2 is considered, it can be
thought of as a quadratic expression in x or a quadratic expression in y. When it is
considered as a quadratic expression in y, it is convenient to write it in the form
– y2 + 2xy + x2.
For example, while 3x2 − 2x − 5, a2 + 2a + 8, y2 + 2y − 5 and 5 −2x − 3x2 are
trinomial quadratic expressions, the expressions a + 2x + 3 and 2x3 + 3x2 −5x are
7.1 Factors of trinomial quadratic expressions
Let us recall how the product of two binomial expressions such as x + 2 and x + 3
is found.
Since x2 + 5x + 6 is obtained as the product of x + 2 and x + 3, we obtain that
x + 2 and x + 3 are factors of x2 + 5x + 6. x2 + 5x + 6 is a trinomial qudratic
expression. How do we obtain x + 2 and x + 3 as its factors? Let us examine the
steps that were performed to obtain the product of the above two expressions, in
the reverse order.
² The middle term 5x of the trinomial quadratic expression x2 + 5x + 6, has
been expressed as a sum of two terms, as 3x + 2x
² The product of the terms 3x and 2x = 3x « 2x = 6x2
² The product of the initial and final terms of the trinomial quadratic
expression x2 + 5x + 6 is x2 « 6 = 6x2
We can come to the following conclusions based on the above observations.
The middle term should be written as the sum of two terms. The product of these
two terms should be equal to the product of the initial and final terms of the trinomial
expression.
As an example, let us factor x2 + 7x + 10 accordingly. Here, 7x is the middle term.
This should be written as the sum of two terms. Also, the product of these two terms
should be equal to 10x2.
The product of the initial and final terms = x2 × 10 = 10x2
The middle term = 7x
Let us find the pair of terms which has 10x2 as its product and 7x as its sum. Let us
consider the following table to do this. The two terms in the first column have been
selected such that their product is 10x2.
Pair of terms
x, 10x
2x, 5x
(−x), (− 10x)
(−2x) , (− 5x)
Product
x x 10x = 10x2
2x x 5x = 10x2
(−x) x(− 10x) = 10x2
(−2x) x(− 5x) = 10x2
x +10x = 11 x
2x + 5x = 7 x
(−x )+ (−10x) = −11x
(−2x) + (−5x ) = −7x
It is clear from the above table that the middle term 7x should be written as 2x + 5x.
Now, let us find the factors of the given trinomial quadratic expression.
Therefore, the factors of x2 + 7x + 10 are x + 2 and x + 5.
Let us see whether the factors are different if we write the middle term of
x2 + 7x + 10 as the sum 5x + 2x, instead of 2x + 5x.
x2 + 7x + 10 = x2 + 5x + 2x + 10
= x (x+ 5) + 2(x+ 5)
= (x+ 5) (x+ 2)
We observe that the same factors are obtained. Therefore, the order in which we
write the two terms that were selected has no effect on the factors. Accordingly, the
factors can be found by writing 7x as either 2x + 5x or as 5x + 2x.
Example 1
Factor a2 −8a + 12.
The product of the initial and final terms = a2 «12 = 12a2
The middle term = − 8a
Find the two terms which have 12a2 as their product and −8a as their sum.
The following table contains pairs of terms of which the product is 12a2. The pair
which when added equals – 8a has been shaded.
Pair of terms
Product
a + 12a = 13a
2a + 6a = 8a
3a + 4a = 7a
(−a) + (−12a) = −13a
(−2a ) + (−6a) = −8a
(−3a) + (−4a) = −7a
That is, − 8a can be written as −2a − 6a
a2 −8a + 12 = a2 −2a − 6a +12
= a (a −2) − 6 (a −2)
a −2) (a −6)
- A table has been used here only as an illustration. The middle term can be
Note(-
obtained as a sum mentally too.
Example 2
Factor x2 − 7x − 8.
The product of the initial and final terms = x2 × (−8) = − 8x2
The middle term = − 7x
The two terms which have −8x2 as their product and −7x as their sum are + x and
− 8x.
Accordingly,
Now let us consider how an expression such as − x2 − x + 6 which has a negative
quadratic term is factored. The factors can be found by re-writing the expression
as 6 − x − x2, with the quadratic term at the end. By considering the example given
below, let us recognize the fact that the factors can be found using either form.
Example 3
Factor − x2 − x + 6.
The product of the initial and final terms = − 6x2
The middle term = − x
− x should be written as 2x − 3x.
Example 4
Factor a2 − 4ab − 5b2.
We may consider this as a trinomial quadratic expression in a.
Then,
the product of the initial and final terms = a2 « (−5b2) = −5a2b2
The middle term = −4ab
The two terms which have −5a2b2 as their product and −4ab as their sum are ab
and −5ab.
Note( This can also be considered as a trinomial quadratic expression in b and
factored. Then too the above answer is obtained.
Accuracy of the factors of a trinomial quadratic expression
The errors made in simplification can be minimized by examing the accuracy of the
factors of a trinomial quadratic expression once they have been found. For example,
let us factor x2 + 3x – 40.
x2 + 3x – 40 = x2 + 8x – 5x – 40
= x (x + 8) – 5 (x + 8)
x + 8) (x – 5)
If the factors x + 8 and x – 5 are correct, by multiplying them together we should be
able to get back our original expression. Let us find the product of x + 8 and x – 5
(x + 8) (x – 5) = x2 – 5x + 8x – 40
= x2 + 3x – 40
Since we have obtained our original expression x2 + 3x – 40, the factors x + 8 and
x – 5 are correct.

(ii) What is the number that has been added to the number denoted by x?
(iii) What is the number that has been subtracted from the number denoted by x?
7.2 The factors of trinomial quadratic expressions described
further
So far we have considered only how the factors of trinomial quadratic expressions
with the coefficient of x2 equal to either 1 or –1 are found. Now let us consider
how the factors are found when the coefficient of x2 is some other integer. For
example, let us consider the trinomial quadratic expression 3x2 + 14x + 15. This is
of the form ax2 + bx + c with a = 3. In such cases too we can use the same method
that we used above.
Example 1
Factor 3x2 + 14x + 15.
The product of the initial and final terms = 45x2
The middle term 14x needs to be written as 5x + 9x. (since 5x × 9x = 45x2).
Example 2
Factor 6x2 + x − 15.
Example 3
Factor 2a2 + 13ab −7b2.
Example 4

7.3 The factors of expressions which are in the form of the
difference of two squares
Consider the product of the two binomial expressions (x − y) and (x + y)
(x − y) (x + y) = x2 + xy − xy − y2
= x2 − y2
We have obtained x2 − y2 which is a difference of two squares. We observe from
the above expansion that the factors of x2 − y2 are x − y and x + y. Further, x2 − y2
can be considered as a quadratic expression in x and factored. By taking its middle
term to be 0, we can write it in the form of a trinomial quadratic expression as
x2 + 0 − y2. Let us factor this expression.
Product of the initial and final terms = − x2y2
Middle term = 0
Accordingly, the pair of terms with product − x2y2 and sum 0 is − xy and xy.
Therefore, by this too we obtain x2 – y2 = (x – y) (x + y).
Let us consider the following examples of the factorization of expressions which
are the difference of two squares.
Example 1
Factor (i) x2 – 4
(ii) 4x2 – 9
(iii) 25a2 – 16b2

By studying this lesson you will be able to
solve problems by applying the theorem on isosceles triangles and its converse.
9.1 Isosceles triangles
If two sides of a triangle are equal, then it is called an isosceles triangle. The triangle
ABC in the figure given below is an isosceles triangle. In this triangle, AB = AC.
The angle in front of each side of a triangle is called the angle opposite that side.
The angle opposite the side AB is
The angle opposite the side AC is
The angle opposite the side BC is
Further, A, which is the vertex at which the two equal sides meet
is called the apex of the triangle.
A theorem related to isosceles triangles is given below.
Theorem: If two sides are equal in a triangle, the angles opposite the equal
sides are equal.
According to the theorem, since AB = AC in the above isosceles triangle ABC,
' Let us engage in the following activity to verify the truth of the above
theorem.
Activity
² Mark three points A, B and C (not collinear) such that AB = AC = 5cm.
² Complete the triangle ABC by joining the points A, B and C.
² Cut out the shape of the triangle ABC.
² Fold the triangular shaped piece of paper so that AB and AC coincide.
² Observe that

theorem together with theorems that have been learnt previously.
Example 1
In the triangle ABC, AB = AC and
Find the magnitude of

According to the figure,
(Angles opposite equal sides in triangle ABC)

Now let us consider how several results on triangles are proved using the above
theorem.

Show that the following coincide.
(i) The perpendicular drawn from A to BC.
(ii) The bisector of the interior angle BAC
(iii) The straight line joining A and the midpoint of BC.

Let us first draw the perpendicular from the vertex A to the opposite side BC.
Construction

bisector of
(iii) BD = DC ( corresponding sides of congruent triangles)
Therefore AD is the line joining A and the mid point of BC.
(construction)
Therefore, AD is the perpendicular bisector of BC.
In an isosceles triangle,
1. the perpendicular drawn from the apex to the opposite side
2. the bisector of the apex angle,
3. the straight line joining the apex to the midpoint of the opposite side and
4. the perpendicular bisector of the side opposite the apex,
coincide with each other.
In some instances, a result in geometry can be proved in several ways.
Now, let us consider such a result.

To prove that AD // BC, let us show that either a pair of alternate angles or a pair of
corresponding angles are equal to each other.
Proof:

Let us now examine whether the sides opposite equal angles are equal for a triangle.
Activity

point using a protractor.

10.1 Inverse Proportions
We know that, when we consider two quantities, if when one quantity increases
according to a certain ratio, the other quantity also increases in the same ratio,
or when one quantity decreases according to a certain ratio, the other quantity
also decreases in the same ratio, then the two quantities are said to be directly
proportional to each other.
In an inverse proportion, when one quantity increases according to a certain ratio,
the other quantity decreases in the same ratio, or when one quantity decreases
according to a certain ratio, the other quantity increases in the same ratio.
Let us establish this fact further by considering the following example.
In a certain hostel, there is sufficient food stored for 12 hostellers for 4 days.
Keeping this amount of food in mind, let us consider the following questions.
(i) If the number of hostellers is 15, will the food be sufficient for four days?
(ii) If the number of hostellers is 6, for how many days will the food be sufficient?
(iii) When the number of hostellers decreases, does the number of days for which
the food is sufficient decrease? Or does it increase?
(iv) For how many days will this food, which is sufficient for 12 hostellers for
4 days, be sufficient for one person?
It is clear that the food which is sufficient for 12 people for 4 days will be sufficient
for 6 people for 8 days, and for one person for 48 days. The following relationships
between the number of hostellers and the number of days for which the food is
sufficient can easily be identified.
Number of hostellers
Number of days
Let us see how the two quantities, namely the number of hostellers and the number
of days for which the food is sufficient change proportionally. According to the
above chart, when the number of hostellers decreases from 8 to 2, the number of
days for which the food is sufficient increases from 6 to 24.
In this case, the ratio of the number of hostellers = 8 : 2 = 4 : 1
The number of days for which the food is sufficient in this case has increased from
6 to 24.
The ratio of the number of days = 6 : 24 = 1 : 4
Although the ratio 1 : 4 is not equal to the ratio 4 : 1, the ratio that is obtained by
interchanging the two numbers of one ratio is the same as the other ratio.
Then,
the ratio of the number of hostellers = 8 : 2 = 4 : 1
the ratio of the corresponding number of days interchanged = 24 : 6 = 4 : 1
A relationship such as the above one between the number of hostellers and the
number of days for which the food is sufficient is called an inverse proportion.
Let us consider two more instances of the relationship between the number of
hostellers and the number of days for which the food is sufficient.
Number of hostellers
Number of days
Ratio of the number of hostellers = 12 : 1
Ratio of the corresponding number of days interchanged = 48 : 4 = 12 : 1
The inverse proportion relationship should hold for any two cases that are considered,
in the same manner that was observed in the above cases.
Two more examples of inverse proportions are given below.
(i) The number of people required to complete a particular task and the amount of
time taken to complete the task.
(ii) When a vehicle travels a constant distance with uniform speed, the speed of the
car and the time taken to complete the journey.
Now, let us consider the following example.
Example 1
It takes 5 men 8 days to complete a certain task. Find the number of days required
by 10 men to complete the same task.
Let us look at two methods that can be used to solve this problem.
Note that this is a problem on inverse proportions.
Method 1
Let us take the number of days required by 10 men to complete the task as x. Then,
Number of men
Number of days
Since this is an inverse proportion,
5 : 10 = x : 8
10x = 8 « 5
The number of days required by 10 men to complete the task = 4
Method 2
Time taken for 5 men to complete the task = 8 days
Time taken for one man to complete the task = 8 days « 5
= 40 days
Time taken for 10 men to complete the task = 40 days ÷ 10
= 4 days
Note: In the above example, the number of days taken by one man to complete the
task, which is 40, can be taken as a measurement of the magnitude of the task. This
value is called the number of man days.
Magnitude of the task = Amount of time required by one man to complete the task
= Number of men « Number of days
Accordingly, the magnitude of the above task can be considered as 40 man days.
The magnitude of a task can be measured in terms of man days as well as in terms
of man hours.
Example 2
It takes 5 men 8 days to complete a certain task. How many men are required to
complete the same task in 2 days?
Let us use method (ii) of example 1.
The number of days required by 5 men to complete the task = 8
The number of days required by one man to complete the task = 8 « 5
The magnitude of the task = 8 « 5 man days
= 40 man days
The number of men required to complete the task in 2 days = 40 ÷ 2
Example 3
Food sufficient for 12 days for a group of 40 men employed at a worksite has been
stored at the site. If 8 more men join the workforce after 6 days, for how many more
days will the food that is remaining be sufficient?
Let us now consider how this problem is solved by two different methods.
Method 1
Amount of food sufficient for 40 men for 12 days = 40 × 12
Amount of food sufficient for 40 men for 6 days = 40 × 6
= 480
Amount of food remaining = 480 – 240
= 240
= 240
Number of days this food is sufficient for 48 men = 240 ÷ 48
= 5 days
Let us now see how this sum can be solved algebraically.
Method 2
The food which is sufficient for the group of 40 men for 12 days will be sufficient
for the 40 of them for 6 days and for a few more days for the 48 men, which
includes the 8 who joined later.
Let us take the number of days for which the food will be sufficient for the
48 men after the 6th day as x. We can then equate the amount of food sufficient for
the 40 men for 12 days to the sum of the amount of food sufficient for the 40 men
for 6 days and the 48 men for x days.
40 « 12
= (40 « 6) + (48 « x)
= 240 + 48x
= 480 − 240
= 240
Therefore, the remaining food will be sufficient for 5 days.

(i) What is the magnitude of the task in man hours?
(ii) The four men decide to complete the task on the next day. How many hours
will they have to work to achieve this?
10.2 Representing inverse proportions algebraically
If it takes eight men one day to complete a certain task, then
• four men would require two days to complete the same task
• if only two men are engaged, four days would be required to complete the task
• it would take one man eight days to complete the task
Observe that in all four of the above situations, the product of the number of men
and the number of days is a constant. That is,
number of men × number of days = a constant
This constant value is the magnitude of the task. The unit used to measure the
magnitude of the task can be taken as man days.
Accordingly, if x is the number of men and y is the number of days, then
xy = k (k is a constant)
x = k
y or y =
According to the definition of direct proportion, this can be expressed as
That is, x and are directly proportional to each other. In this case we say that x
and y are inversely proportional to each other.
Example 1
8 men can complete a certain task in 9 days. However, it was possible to employ
only 6 men. How many days will it take these 6 men to complete the task?
Let us denote the number of men by x and the number of days by y. Then, by using
the equation xy = k and substituting the data, we obtain the equations,
8 « 9 k and
Note that we can use the same constant k as we refer to the same task.
Since it is the same task, the constant k is the same.
Substituting for k, we obtain the equation
i.e.,
Therefore, it will take these 6 men 12 days to complete the task.
Example 2
A group of men, who completed a certain task in 9 days, recruited 3 more men to
work on a similar task. If together they completed the task in 6 days, find how many
men there were in the initial group.
Suppose the number of men who were in the first group is x.
Then, according to the data, we obtain the equations,
Therefore, the number of men in the initial group was 6.
Solve the sums in the exercise given below algebraically.

Data Representation
By studying this lesson you will be able to
² draw pie charts based on the given data
² extract information from a pie chart
11.1 Representing data in pie charts
The information gathered from the grade 10 students of a certain school regarding
the sport they like the most, of the three sports, namely cricket, volleyball and elle
is given below.
Sport

Cricket
Volleyball
The above information can be represented in a picture graph and a column graph
as follows.

The height of each column in the column graph denotes the number of students who
like the relevant sport. In the picture graph this is denoted by the figures.
The pie chart is another method of representing data. Pie charts are also called pie
graphs.
In a pie chart, the area of the whole circle represents the total number of data. The
different frequencies are represented by suitable sectors.
Let us now consider how these sectors are found.
of the area of the circle.
As an example, let us consider the above circle which has been divided into 8 equal
sectors.
Since the circle has been divided into 8 equal sectors, the area of each sector is
equal to
Also, the angle around the centre of this circle is divided into eight equal parts by
the sectors.
Therefore, the angle at the centre of each sector is
of the angle around the centre.
The angle around the center is 360x. Therefore the angle at the centre of each sector
is 1 of 360x.
That is, the angle at the centre of a sector which is
of the circle
Similarly, the angle at the centre of the sector which is
3 of the circle
Now let us draw a suitable pie chart to represent the data in the above table.
First, let us draw a circle of suitable radius (about 3 cm')
Let us represent the 60 students by the total area of the circle, which corresponds to
the angle of 360o around the centre of the circle.
Then the angle at the centre of the sector which denotes one student.
Sector denoting one student.
Accordingly, the angle at the centre of the sector which
denotes the 25 students who like cricket the most
Now let us represent this within the circle as follows
Cricket
The sector which denotes the
students who like cricket the most
Similarly, the angle at the centre of the sector which
denotes the 20 students who like volleyball the most
The remaining sector of the circle represents the students who like elle. The
' However this is not
corresponding angle at the centre can be found using
necessary, since this angle is equal to the angle obtained by subtracting the above
two angles from 360o' All the above facts can be shown in a pie chart as follows.
Volleyball
Cricket
120x 150x
Cricket
Volleyball
Usually the angle at the centre is not denoted in a pie chart. Instead, the value
represented by each sector is given as a percentage.
The comparison of data is facilitated by the sectors being shaded in different colours
or covered with different patterns' Since all the data is represented by one circle
comparisons such as ‘more than’ or ‘less than’ can easily be made.
Example 1
The information on the type of lunch packet preferred by 600 people who participated
in a ‘Shramadana’ is given below.

The angle at the centre of the sector denoting the
250 people who prefer fish
The angle at the centre of the sector denoting the
150 people who prefer eggs
The angle at the centre of the sector denoting the
75 people who prefer chicken
It is not neccessary to calculate the angle at the centre of the sector denoting those
who prefer vegetables since the remaining portion of the circle denotes this.

Least Common Multiple of Algebraic Expressions
By studying this lesson you will be able to
find the least common multiple of several algebraic expressions.
Finding the least common multiple of numbers
The least common multiple (LCM) of several whole numbers is the smallest number
which is divisible by all these numbers. You have learnt earlier how this is found.
Let us recall what you have learnt.
Let us find the least common multiple of the numbers 6, 8 and 12 by writing these
numbers as a product of their prime factors.
The distinct prime factors of the above three numbers are 2 and 3. When all three
numbers are considered,
the greatest power of 2 = 23
the greatest power of 3 = 31
∴ The least common multiple
Accordingly, the least common multiple of several numbers can be found in the
following manner.
1. Write each number as a product of its prime factors.
2. From the factors of all the numbers, select the greatest power of each prime
number.
3. By multiplying all these powers together, obtain the required LCM.

12.2 Finding the least common multiple of algebraic expressions which
include binomial expressions
Let us find the least common multiple of 2x + 4 and 3x – 9.
To find the LCM of such expressions, their factors need to be found first.
2x + 4 = 2 ^x + 2&
3x – 9 = 3 ^x – 3&
The distinct factors are 2, 3, ^x + 2& and ^x – 3&. The index of each of these factors
is 1.
The product of the largest powers of these factors
∴ LCM
Example 1
Find the least common multiple of 15x2" 20 ^x + 1&" 10 ^x + 1&2
15x2 = 3 « 5 « x2
20 ^x + 1& = 2 « 2 « 5 « ^x +1& = 22 « 5 « ^x + 1&
10 ^x + 1&2 = 2 « 5 « ^x +1&2
The distinct factors are 2, 3, 5, x and (x + 1).
∴ LCM
Example 2
Find the least common multiple of the algebraic expressions (b – a), 2(a – b) and
4a2 (a – b)2
Since (a – b) is a factor of two of
these expressions, it is necessary to
express (b – a) as – (a – b).
The distinct factors are 2, (–1), a and (a – b).
∴ The product of the largest powers
∴ LCM
Note: Knowing that although a – b = –(b – a), we have (a – b)2 = (b – a)2 , facilitates
problem solving.

Example 1
Find the least common multiple of the algebraic expressions 2x – 6" 4x ^x – 3&2 and
6 ^x2 – 9&
2x – 6 = 2 ^x – 3&
4x ^x – 3&2 = 2 « 2 « x « ^x – 3&2
6 ^x2 – 9& = 2 « 3 « ^x – 3& ^x + 3&

Simplify
respectively. Since
x and 2x are the two terms in the denominators of
they are unequal, the two fractions cannot be added directly. Therefore, let us
first write equivalent fractions that have a common denominator and then do the
simplification.
That is,
Here 2x is the denominator of the equivalent fractions. Observe that 2x is the least
common multiple of the denominators (x and 2x) of the given two fractions.

14.1 Taxes
The government of each country collects money from its citizens to meet recurrent
expenses. This money is called taxes. Different types of taxes are collected in
different ways and in varying amounts. The method that is used most to collect
taxes is charging a percentage of the amount involved. Taxes that an individual has
to pay directly to the government are called direct taxes. Several types of direct
taxes are given below.
• Rates
• Customs duty
• Income tax
Taxes that are not charged directly are called indirect taxes. Value added tax (VAT)
is one such tax that is charged at present.
Rates
Rates are taxes charged by urban councils, municipal councils, provincial councils
etc., from households and businesses that come within their administrative domain.
These taxes are used for various purposes such as the maintenance of roads and
street lights, garbage collection and disposal etc. Properties owned by individuals
and businesses are assessed annually by the government, and the relevant council
charges a percentage of the assessed annual value of the property as rates. This
is calculated annually and can be paid in total at the beginning of the year, or in
4 equal quarterly installments once every three months.
Example 1
A house of assessed annual value Rs. 36 000 is charged annual rates of 4%. Calculate
the rates that have to be paid for a quarter.
Annual rates = Rs. 36 000
= Rs. 1 440
The rates that have to be paid for a quarter = Rs. 1 440
= Rs. 360
Example 2
The assessed annual value of a shop within the administrative domain of a certain
urban council is Rs. 24 000. The quarterly rates payable on this property is Rs. 300.
Calculate the rates percentage charged by the council.
Assessed annual value of the shop = Rs. 24 000
Rates charged for a quarter = Rs. 300
Rates charged for the year = Rs. 300
= Rs. 1 200
Accordingly, the rates percentage charged =
Customs Duty
When certain items are imported or exported, a certain percentage of the value of
the item has to be paid as taxes to the government. Such taxes are called customs
duty. This tax is charged by Sri Lanka Customs.
Individuals who have worked abroad are entitled to a duty free quota on their return,
which may be used to purchase certain items without paying customs duty, from the
duty free shops housed in the international airport.
Further, certain government servants are entitled to a reduction in customs duty
when importing vehicles.
Example 1
If customs duty of 10% of the value of the item has to be paid when a certain type
of clock is imported, how much duty has to be paid when a clock of this type of
value Rs. 5 000 is imported?
Customs duty that has to be paid = Rs. 5 000
= Rs. 500
Example 2
When a car is imported, 60% of its value has to be paid as customs duty. Find the
total amount with the duty included, that it costs a person to import a car worth
Rs. 2 000 000.
Method 1
Amount of customs duty that has to be paid = Rs. 2 000 000
= Rs. 1 200 000
Cost of the vehicle with the customs duty included = Rs. 2 000 000 + 1 200 000
= Rs. 3 200 000
Method 2
Cost of the vehicle with the customs duty included = Rs. 2 000 000
= Rs. 3 200 000
Example 3
If Rs. 18 000 was charged as customs duty when a stock of fruits worth Rs. 300 000
was exported to the Middle East, find the percentage of the value of the stock that
the exporter had to pay as customs duty.
The value of the stock of fruits = Rs. 300 000
Customs duty that was paid = Rs .18 000
Percentage charged as customs duty =
Example 4
The value of a television set with a 15% customs duty added to it is Rs. 28 750.
What is the value of the television set without the duty?
The value of the television set without the customs duty = Rs. 28 750
= Rs. 25 000
Income Tax
The government imposes a tax on the annual income of an individual, which is
earned as salary, from property or through a business, and which exceeds a certain
limit. Such taxes are called income taxes.
The income tax for a particular year can either be paid annually or in quarterly
installments. A table with the information on how the taxes are calculated, which
was implemented in 2011 by the Inland Revenue Department is given below. (These
values may change in the future)
Annual Income
Initial Rs. 500 000
Next Rs. 500 000
Next Rs. 500 000
Next Rs. 500 000
Next Rs. 500 000
Next Rs. 500 000
Balance taxable income
Tax Percentage
Tax free
(Table 13.1)
This table is used to perform calculations related to the examples and problems on
income tax in this lesson.
Example 1
If the annual income of an individual is Rs. 575 000, calculate the income tax he
has to pay for the year.
The annual income = Rs. 575 000
Tax free income = Rs. 500 000
Taxable income = Rs. 575 000 − 500 000
= Rs. 75 000
Payable tax = Rs. 75 000
= Rs. 3 000
Example 2
If the annual income of a certain businessman is Rs. 1 650 000, calculate the total
annual income tax he has to pay.
First let us separate the annual income as shown below.
1,650 000 = 500 000 + 500 000 + 500 000 + 150 000
Annual
income
Tax free
income
4] tax
8] tax
12] tax
Tax free income = Rs. 500 000
Tax charged on the next Rs. 500 000 = Rs. 500 000
= Rs. 20 000
Tax charged on the next Rs. 500 000
= Rs. 500 000
= Rs. 40 000
Tax charged on the next Rs. 150 000 = Rs. 150 000
= Rs. 18 000
Total income tax that has to be paid = Rs. 20 000 + 40 000 + 18 000
= Rs. 78 000
Value Added Tax (VAT)
When a product or a service is bought, a percentage of its total value is charged as
value added tax. The trader who sells the product and the service provider who are
both bound to pay this tax, charge it from the consumer.
Example 1
A certain person’s monthly telephone charges are Rs. 2 500. If a VAT of 15% is
added to this charge, what is his monthly bill?
Method 1
VAT = Rs. 2 500
= Rs. 375
Total bill = Rs. 2 500 + 375
= Rs. 2 875
Method 2
Rs. 2 500
Rs. 2 875
Example 2
The production cost of a pair of shoes produced by a certain organization is given
below.
Raw materials
Labour
Other expenses
Total cost
= Rs. 1 200
= Rs. 300
= Rs. 200
= Rs. 1 700
The organization hopes to gain a profit of Rs. 250 from this product. A VAT of 15%
has to be paid to the government on the price of the pair of shoes. Find the selling
price of the pair of shoes with the VAT included.
Price without VAT = Rs. 1 700 + 250 = Rs. 1 950
VAT that needs to be paid = Rs. 1 950
Method 2
Selling price of the pair of shoes -
-= Rs. 1950 + 292.50
= Rs. 2 242.50
= Rs. 292.50
Rs. 1 950
Rs. 2 242.50

14.2 Interest
When a loan has been taken from an individual or an institution, the extra amount
that has to be paid when settling the loan after a period of time is called the interest.
Similarly, when money has been deposited in a bank or some other financial
institution for a period of time, the extra amount that is received at the end of the
period is also called the interest.
Usually, the interest that has to be paid for a year is a percentage of the loan amount
(or deposit amount). This percentage is called the annual interest rate. The interest
rate can also be given monthly or semi-annually.
Simple Interest
When calculating the interest for a specific period, if only the initial amount
(principal) is taken into consideration, then such interest is called simple interest.
Example 1
It took a man 2 years to settle a loan of Rs. 5 000 borrowed at an annual simple
interest rate of 10%. How much interest did he pay in total?
Simple interest paid for a year = Rs. 5 000
= Rs. 500
Simple interest paid for two years = Rs. 500
= Rs. 1 000
Example 2
Find the total amount that Senal has to pay to settle a loan in three months, if he
borrowed Rs. 8 000 at a monthly simple interest rate of 2%.
Interest for a month
Interest for three months
= Rs. 8 000
= Rs. 160
= Rs. 160
= Rs. 480
total amount to be paid in three months
Since total amount = Loan + Interest,
= Rs. 8 000 + 480
= Rs. 8 480
Example 3
How long will it take for a person who gave a loan of Rs 10 000 at an annual simple
interest rate of 12%, to receive an interest of Rs. 3 600?
Simple interest received for a year = Rs. 10 000
= Rs. 1 200
Number of years it takes to
receive Rs. 3 600 as interest
= 3 years
Example 4
If the simple interest that had to be paid for two years, on a loan of Rs.7 500 was
Rs.1 200, find the annual simple interest rate that was charged.
Interest for two years
Interest for a year
Annual simple interest rate
= Rs.1 200
= Rs.1 200 2
= Rs.600
= 600
7 500
Example 5
How many years after taking a loan of Rs. 25 000 at an annual simple interest rate
of 7.5%, does a person have to pay a total amount of Rs. 28 750 to settle the loan?
Interest for a year = Rs. 25 000
= Rs. 1 875
Loan = Rs. 25 000
Total amount to be paid = Rs. 28 750
Total interest to be paid = Rs. 28 750 − 25 000
= Rs. 3 750
Time period for which interest has to be paid =
= 2 years
Example 6
If the total amount that had to be paid after 4 months to settle a loan borrowed at a
monthly simple interest rate of 1.5% was Rs.5 300, find the loan amount.
The meaning of “A monthly simple interest rate of 1.5%” is that “Rs.1.50 has to be
paid as interest for a month for a loan amount of Rs 100.
That is, interest paid for 1 month on a loan of Rs.100 = Rs'1.50
Interest paid for 4 months on a loan of Rs. 100 = Rs'1.50 « 4 = Rs'6
Total amount paid in 4 months for a loan of Rs. 100 = Rs'100 + 6 = Rs'106
Loan amount for which the total amount of Rs'106 = Rs'100
has to be paid after 4 months
Loan amount for which the total amount of Rs. 5300 =
has to be paid after 4 months
= Rs.5000

Solving simple equations
Let us work on the following exercise in order to revise the knowledge we have
acquired on solving simple equations.
Review Exercise
1. Solve the following equations.
15.1 Solving simple equations described further:
Let us learn how to construct and solve an equation.
Did you observe that some of the equations in the above exercise contain fractions.
The unknown term (x, y, p, a) was in the numerator of the fraction?. Now we are
going to construct and solve equations with fractions of which the unknown term is
in the denominator. Let us construct and solve such an equation.
Twelve is divided by two numbers of which the value of one number is double that
of the other. The difference between the two quotients is 2. Find the two numbers.
Let us examine how this problem can be solved by the trial and error method.
Case I: Can the two numbers be 2 and 4?
, so the difference is 6 – 3 = 3, and they do not work.
Case II: Can the two numbers be 6 and 12?
, so the difference is 2 – 1 = 1, and they do not work.
Case III: Can the two numbers be 3 and 6?
, so the difference is 4 – 2 = 2, and they work!
Thus, the problem can be solved using the method of trial and error. However,
for some problems, the trial and error method is too long. Also, some problems
cannot be solved by trial and error method. A suitable method of solving this type of
problems is by using equations. Now, let us see how it can be solved by constructing
an equation.
Suppose 12 is divided by a number x and its double 2x.
Then the quotient of 12 divided by x is
The quotient of 12 divided by twice the x, i.e., 2x, is
Because the difference between the two quotients is 2, we get
The value of x obtained by solving this equation gives us the required number. Let
us solve this equation. This is an equation having fractions with algebraic terms
in the denominator. The first fraction contains x in the denominator. The second
fraction has 2x in the denominator. Let us make the denominators of both fractions
by the equivalent fraction
equal. The easiest way to do this is by replacing
, which is
Then,
Multiplying both sides by 2x
i.e.,
Dividing both sides by 4
It follows that the two numbers are 3 and 6.
i.e.,
Note:This equation can be solved by writing the equation
cross multiplication too.
as 12 = 4x by
Example 1
Several friends shared 60 mangoes equally. One of them, Amal, sold three of his
mangoes, and then he had only two mangoes left. How many friends shared the
mangoes?
In reality, this problem can easily be solved mentally. Nevertheless, let us solve this
equation as follows just to illustrate the construction and solving of equations.
Let x be the number of friends.
Then, the number of mangoes one person obtains =
Number of mangoes Amal sold
Then, the number of mangoes left
Since he had only two left, we may write,
Let us now solve this equation.
Let us add 3 to both sides.
− 3 + 3 = 2 + 3
Then, 5x = 60
Hence, x = 12.
Therefore, 12 friends shared mangoes.
Observe how the following equations are solved.

equal. We have seen how to solve simultaneous equations of this nature, i.e., when
the coefficients of one unknown are equal. Let us see how simultaneous equations
are solved when the coefficients of both unknowns are un equal, i.e., the coefficients
of each unknown are different.
Example 1:
Sajithi and Sanjana have certain amounts of money. When twice the amount of
money Sanjana has is added to the amount of money Sajithi has, we get Rs. 110.
When thrice the amount of money Sanjana has is added to twice the amount of
money Sajithi has, the amount is Rs. 190. Find the amount of money each has.
Let us see how simultaneous equations can be used to solve this problem. Let the
amount of money Sajithi has be Rs. x and the amount of money Sanjana has be
Rs. y. Then, the sum of the amount of money Sajithi has and twice the amount of
money Sanjana has is Rs. x + 2y. Because this amount is equal to Rs. 110, we get
x + 2y = 110
Also, the sum of twice the amount of money Sajithi has and thrice the amount of
money Sanjana has is Rs. 2x + 3y. Because this amount is equal to Rs 190, we get
2x + 3y = 190
The coefficients of neither x nor of y of the equations (1) and (2) are equal.
Therefore, let us equate the coefficients of one of the unknowns. In order to make
the coefficient of x in the first equation 2, let us multiply that equation by 2. Then
we get
2x + 4y = 220
Now, the coefficients of x in both equations are equal.
Therefore, from 3 and 2 , we get,
2x + 4y – (2x + 3y) = 220 – 190
2x + 4y – 2x – 3y = 30
y = 30
Substituting the value of y in the first equation,
2 = 110
Therefore, the amount of money Sajithi has is Rs 50 and the amount of money
Sanjana has is Rs 30.
Example 2
Solve: 2m + 3n = 13
3m + 5n = 21
Let us denote the two equations as
2m + 3n = 13
3m + 5n = 21
From 1 × 3, we get, 6m + 9n = 39
From 2 × 2, we get, 6m + 10n = 42
Then, from 4 and 3 , we get,
6m + 10n – (6m + 9n) = 42 – 39
6m + 10n – 6m – 9n = 3
n = 3
Substituting n = 3 in (1), we get
2m + 3n = 13
2m + 3×3 = 13
2m = 13 – 9
2m = 4
m = 2
i.e., m = 2 and n = 3
Example 3
The price of two oranges and one king coconut is Rs. 80. Three king coconuts cost
the same amount as two oranges. Find the price of an orange and a king coconut
separately.
Let us construct two equations from the given information.
Let the price of one orange be Rs. x and that of a king coconut be Rs. y.
Then, the price of two oranges and a king coconut is 2x + y. Since this is equal to
Rs. 80, we get
2x + y = 80.
Because the price of two oranges is equal to that of three king coconut, we get,
2x = 3y.
Let us denote the equations as
2x + y = 80
2x = 3y
These two equations can be solved just the way we did in the previous example, by
writing the second equation as 2x – 3y = 0. However, there is an easier way to do it
in this case. That is, substituting from one equation to the other.
Substitute 3y from equation (2) for 2x in equation (1) to get
3y + y = 80
4y = 80
y = 20
Substitute y = 20 in (1) to get
2x + 20 = 80
2x = 60
x = 30
Therefore, the price of one orange is Rs. 30 and that of a king coconut is Rs. 20.
Example 4
Solve: x = 3y
2x + 3y = 18
Denote the two equations as
x = 3y
2x + 3y = 18
Substitute for x in equation (2) from equation (1) to get
2 « (3y) + 3y = 18
6y + 3y = 18
9y = 18
y = 2
Substitute y = 2 in (1) to get
x = 3y
x = 3 « 2
x = 6
i.e., x = 6 and y = 2.

15.3 Quadratic Equations
An equation of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0 is called a quadratic equation where a ≠ 0.
The terms b and c might be 0. Observe the following equations.
^i& x2 + 5x + 6 = 0
^ii& 2x2 – 5x = 0
^iii& x2 – 9 = 0
Each of the above equations is a quadratic equation since a ≠ 0, whereas c = 0 in the
second equation and b = 0 in the third equation.
Before solving the quadratic equations, let us consider the following:
• When any number is multiplied by zero, the product is zero.
• If the product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers is zero.
So, let us see for what values of x the expression (x – 1)(x – 3) is zero. The expression
is zero only when x – 1= 0 or x – 3 = 0, that is, only when x =1 or x = 3.
Now, consider the equation (x– 1)(x – 3) = 0. The values x = 1 and x = 3 satisfy this
equation. Then, 1 and 3 are called the roots of this equation.
Now, consider the equation x2 + 5x + 6 = 0.
Since x2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 3)(x + 2), the equation can be rewritten as (x + 3)(x + 2) = 0.
Then, x + 3 = 0 or x + 2 = 0.
There fore, x = –3 and x = –2 satisfy the equation. This can be verified as follows.
When x = –3,
x2 + 5x + 6 = ^–3&2 + 5^–3& + 6
= 9 + ^–15& + 6
When x = –2,
x2 + 5x +6 = ^–2&2 + 5^–2& + 6
= 4 +^–10& + 6
Thus, the roots of the equation x2 + 5x + 6 = 0 are –3 and –2. In other words, the
solutions of the equation are x = –3 and x = –2.
Example 1
Solve the equation x2 + 2x = 0
x2 + 2x = 0
x ^x + 2& = 0
x = 0 or x + 2 = 0
x = 0 or x = – 2
Hence, x = 0 and x = –2 are the solutions of the given equation.
Example 2
Solve the equation x2 – 3x + 2 = 0
x2 – 3x + 2 = 0
^x – 1& ^x – 2& = 0
x – 1 = 0 or x – 2 = 0
x = 1 or x = 2
Hence, x = 1 and x = 2 are the solutions of the given equation.
Example 3
Solve the equation x2 – 4x – 21 = 0
x2 – 4x – 21 = 0
^x – 7& ^x + 3& = 0
x – 7 = 0 or x + 3 = 0
x = 7 or x = – 3
Hence, x = 7 and x = – 3 are the solutions of the given equation.
Note: When there are two factors to a quadratic expression, there are two distinct
roots to the that equation.
Exercise 15.3
Solve each of the following quadratic equations.
^a& ^x – 2& ^ x – 3& = 0
^c& ^x – 4& ^ x – 4& = 0
^e& x ^ x + 3& = 0
^g& x2 – 16 = 0
^i& 9x2 – 27x = 0
^k& 2x2 – 5x + 2 = 0
^m& 2x2 = 6x
^o& ^x + 3&2 = 16
^q& ^2x – 3&2 = 0
^s& ^x – 1& ^ x – 2& = 2x2 – 3x – 2
^b& ^ x + 2& ^ x – 5& = 0
^d& ^x – 1& ^ 2x – 1& = 0
^f& y ^2y – 3& = 0
^h& 4x2 – 1 = 0
^j& x2 + 15x + 36 = 0

Parallelograms I
By studying this lesson you will be able to
solve problems and prove riders using the properties of parallelograms.
Parallelograms
A closed plane figure bounded by four straight line segments is called a quadrilateral.
Let us consider the opposite sides and the opposite angles of a quadrilateral.
In the quadrilateral PQRS, PQ and SR are a pair of opposite sides, and PS and QR
are the other pair of opposite sides. While
form a pair of opposite
angles, the other pair of opposite angles is
A quadrilateral with both pairs of opposite sides parallel is defined as a parallelogram.
A pair of arrowheads have been used to indicate that the sides AB and DC of the
above parallelogram are parallel to each other. Also, two arrowheads each have
been used to indicate that the sides BC and AD are parallel.
16.1 Properties of Parallelograms

two copies of PQRS and cut them out.
² In one parallelogram, draw the diagonal PR.
² Now cut this parallelogram along the diagonal and see whether the two triangles
that you obtain coincide.
It should be clear to you that the two triangles coincide. Therefore, the areas of the
two triangles are equal. Similarly, use the other parallelogram you cut out to verify
that the areas of the two triangles obtained by cutting the parallelogram along the
other diagonal are also equal.
According to the above activity,
The opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal, the opposite angles of a
parallelogram are equal, and the area of the parallelogram is bisected by each
diagonal.
Activity 2
As in activity 1, draw a parallelogram using a set square and a ruler. Name it ABCD
as in the following figure.
² Now draw the diagonals AC and BD. Name their intersection point as O.
² Measure the lengths of OA,OB,OC and OD.
² What can you say about the lengths of OA and OC?
² What can you say about the lengths of OB and OD?
² It should be clear to you that OA = OC and that OB = OD.
Accordingly, it is clear that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.
Now let us consider how various elements of a parallelogram are found based on
the data that is given.

16.2 Properties of a parallelogram
Since the properties that we observed above in parallelograms are common to all
parallelograms, we can present them in the form of a theorem as follows.
Theorem 1: In a parallelogram,
(i) opposite sides are equal.
(ii) opposite angles are equal.
(iii) the area of the parallelogram is bisected by each diagonal.
Theorem 2: In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other.
Now let us consider how the first three parts of this theorem are proved formally.
Data: ABCD is a parallelogram.
To be proved: ^i& AB = DC and AD = BC
^iii& Area of
Area of ACD = Area of ABC

We can obtain the three results by showing that the triangles ABD and BCD are
congruent. Let us prove that the two triangles are congruent under the case AAS as

(i) Since the triangles ADQ and PBC are congruent, the corresponding elements
of the two triangles are equal.
are alternate angles.
Since a pair of alternate angles are equal, AQ // PC.

According to the information given in the diagram, prove that O is the mid point
of XY.
We need to prove that XO = OY. To do this, let us first show that the triangles AOX

Proof:

(AX//CY, Alternate angles&
^Vertically opposite angles&
^Diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other&

Corresponding elements of congruent triangles are equal.
i.e., O is the mid point of XY.

(iii) Prove that X is the mid-point of PQ.
(iv) Prove that PQ = 2 PS.
Parallelograms II
By studying this lesson you will be able to
identify the conditions that need to be satisfied for a quadrilateral to be a
parallelogram.
Theorem: If the opposite sides of a quadrilateral are equal, then it is a
parallelogram.
For example, in the given figure, AB = DC and
AD = BC.
Therefore, ABCD is a parallelogram.
Let us engage in the following activity to establish the truth of the above theorem.
Activity 1
• Draw
as shown in the figure, such that the sides of the angle are of length
5 cm and 3 cm.
• As shown in the second figure, obtain the point C
which is 3 cm from B and 5 cm from D.
• Now complete the quadrilateral ABCD.
• Then it can be seen that AB = DC and AD = BC.
• By using a set square and a ruler or by measuring
the angles and obtaining that the sum of a pair of
allied angles is 180o, observe that the opposite sides
of the quadrilateral are parallel. That is, obtain that
AB//DC and AD//BC.
It can be observed that in a quadrilateral with opposite side equal, the opposite
sides are parallel too.
Theorem: If the opposite angles of a quadrilateral are equal, then it is a
parallelogram.
For example, in the given figure, since
, by the
theorem, PQRS is a parallelogram.
Let us engage in the following activity to establish the truth of the above theorem.
Activity 2
• Measure all the angles in each of the following quadrilaterals.
• Check whether the opposite pairs of angles of each quadrilateral are equal.
• Check whether the pairs of opposite sides are parallel in the quadrilateral with
opposite angles equal. (See whether the sum of the allied angles is 180o.)
Accordingly, observe that in the quadrilateral with opposite angles equal, the
opposite sides are parallel to each other.
Theorem: If the diagonals of a quadrilateral bisect each other, then it is a
parallelogram.
For example, in the quadrilateral ABCD, since
AO = OC and BO = OD, according to the theorem,
ABCD is a parallelogram.
Engage in the following activity to establish the truth of the above theorem.
Activity 3
• To draw the quadrilateral ABCD with diagonals AC and BD, first draw the
diagonal AC and name its midpoint O.
• Now draw another straight line segment such that it intersects the diagonal AC at
O. Mark the points B and D on this line segment such that OB = OD.
• Now complete the quadrilateral ABCD as shown above.
• Check whether the sides AB and DC as well as the sides BC and AD in the
quadrilateral ABCD are parallel to each other by using a set square and a ruler or
by measuring a pair of alternate angles.
Accordingly, it can be seen that if the diagonals of a quadrilateral bisect each other,
then the opposite sides are parallel to each other.
Theorem: In a quadrilateral, if a pair of opposite sides is equal and parallel,
p;=ri%hl úl¾K tlsfkl iuÉfþ o jkafka kï th iudka;rdi%hls'
then the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.
For example, in the quadrilateral PQRS, since PQ = SR and
PQ//SR, it is a parallelogram.
Engage in the following activity to establish the truth of the
above theorem.
Activity 4
• Draw a pair of parallel lines using a set square and a ruler or by some other
method.
• Mark two points A and B on one of these lines.
• Mark a length equal to AB on the other line as shown in the figure, and name it
• Now complete the quadrilateral ABCD and draw the diagonal AC as shown in the
figure.
By measuring the pair of alternate angles x and y using
a protractor, or by using a set square and ruler, observe
that AD and BC are parallel to each other.
Accordingly, it can be seen that in a quadrilateral, if a pair of opposite sides is equal
and parallel, then the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.
Now, by considering the following example, let us see how riders are proved using
the above theorems.
Example 1
T is the midpoint of the side BC of the triangle ABC. The straight line drawn through
C, parallel to AB meets AT produced at D. Prove that ABDC is a parallelogram.
First, let us draw the figure according to the given information.
We know that in a quadrilateral, if a pair of opposite sides is equal and parallel,
then it is a parallelogram. Therefore, let us show that ABDC is a parallelogram by
showing that a pair of opposite sides is equal and parallel. It is given that AB//CD.
Let us show that AB = CD.
To obtain this, let us show that the triangles ABT and CTD are congruent.
In the triangles ABT and CTD
(Given)
(Vertically opposite angle)
Alternate angles
(A.A.S.)
Since corresponding elements of congruent triangles are equal,
AB = CD.
Since AB = CD and AB // CD, we obtain that ABDC is a parallelogram.

By studying this lesson, you will be able to
• identify methods of describing sets
• identify the regions in a Venn diagram when at most two sets
are represented in the Venn diagram and solve problems using the formula
relating the number of elements in these sets.
Set Notation
You have learnt three methods of describing sets before. They are
• the descriptive method
• the method of listing elements
• the Venn diagram method.
Let A be the set of all multiples of 3 between 1 and 10. Then, A can be denoted using
the above three methods as follows:
• As a description,
A = {multiples of 3 between 1 and 10} or
A = set of all multiples of 3 between 1 and 10.
• Listing the elements
A = {3, 6, 9}
• In a Venn diagram,
18.1 Set Builder Method
Set builder method is another method to describe sets. The set of all multiples of 3
between 1 and 10 can be denoted using the set builder method as follows:
A = {x : x is a multiple of 3 and 1< x < 10}.
The symbol x here is like a variable. You may use any symbol in place of x. The
statement after the colon describes how the elements should be. There are several
ways a set can be represented using the set builder method. For example, the
following are three different ways of denoting the set A = {1, 2} using the set
builder method.
A = { x : (x – 1) (x – 2) = 0 }
A = { y :
A = {n
: 0 < n ≤ 2 }
and 1 ≤ y ≤ 2 }
Look at the following table for more examples on the set builder method.
Set builder form
A = {Positive integers less than 10} A = {x: x
and 0 < x < 10}
A = {
: 0 < x < 10}
B = {16, 25, 36, 49}
B = { x : x is a perfect square' 16 ≤ x ≤ 49}
C = { x : x
, −2 ≤ x ≤ 3 }
C = {
: −2 ≤ x ≤ 3 }
Exercise 18.1

(i) the descriptive method
(ii) the listing method

(i) A = {3, 6, 9, 12}
(ii) B
(iii) C = { x : x is a perfect square and 10 < x < 100 }
3. Describe each of the following sets using the descriptive method.
i. X = {All letters in the word “ANURADHAPURA”}
ii. A = {x : x is a prime number and 10 < x < 20}

A = { y :
A = {n

18. 2 Regions in a Venn Diagram
In Venn diagrams, the universal set is represented by a rectangular region and is
denoted by ε.
The subsets of the universal set are represented by circular (or elliptical) regions.
These subsets give rise to several regions in the Venn diagram that represents the
universal set. Now let us investigate these regions.
1. When there is one subset represented in the universal set.
The subset A divides the universal set into two regions which are shaded in the next
figure.The subsets corresponding to these regions can be denoted by A and A using
set notation.
C = {
: −2 ≤ x ≤ 3 }
1. Describe the set of all positive integers from10 to 15 using
2. Describe each of the following sets using the descriptive method.
(iii) C = { x : x is a perfect square and 10 < x < 100 }
3. Describe each of the following sets using the descriptive method.
i. X = {All letters in the word “ANURADHAPURA”}
ii. A = {x : x is a prime number and 10 < x < 20}
Exercise 18.1
(i) the descriptive method
(ii) the listing method
(iii) a Venn diagram
(iv) the set builder method.
(i) A = {3, 6, 9, 12}
(ii) B
Complement of A = A
2. When two subsets are represented in the Venn diagram
Let A and B be the two subsets. When there are no common elements in A and B,
that is, when A∩B = O , and when there are common elements in A and B, that is
when A∩B O, the relevant Venn diagrams are shown below.
Before investigating the regions let us recall the following definitions.
A = Set of elements not in A
= Set of elements belonging to both A and B
= Set of elements belonging to A or B (or both)
As an example, let us take ε = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
A = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} and
B = {2, 3, 5, 7}
Then, we can represent the above information in a Venn diagram as given below.
According to the given information, it is clear that
A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
= {2} and
= {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10}
Also, when we observe the Venn diagram we can see that
) = {1, 9} and
) = {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
Two subsets of a universal set represented in a Venn diagram give rise to several
regions' Some such regions and the way they can be written down using set
complement, set intersection and set union are shown below.
^iii&
For the example we discussed above, we have that
= {4, 6, 8, 10} and
= {3, 5, 7}
Also, the Venn diagram given below is obtained by the Venn diagrams (v) and (vi)
Exercise 18.2
1. a. Shade the region denoted by each of the following sets in separate Venn
diagrams.
(i) A ∩B
(iii) (A∩B)
(v) (A∩B)
(vii) (A ∩B) (viii) (A
(ix) (A B)
(ii) A B
(iv) (A B)
(A B) (vi) (A∩B )
b. By investigating the regions you shades in part (a) above, find all pairs of
equal sets.
2. Shown below is the Venn diagram of two sets A and B where
. In 6 copies
of this Venn diagram, shade each of the given 6 regions.
(i) A∩B
(iii) A ∩B
(v) (A B)
(ii) A B
(iv) A
(vi) (A ∩B)
3. The information on the children in a society is shown in the following Venn
diagram. (The letters a, b, c and d indicate the regions in which the letters are
written.)
Age above 10
years
girls
Describe in words the regions indicated by each of the letters a, b, c and d. For
example, the boys whose ages are above 10 years are indicated by a.
4. Let ε = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
A ∩B = {4, 5}
A∩B = {3}
(A B) = {1}
Include the above information in a suitable Venn diagram and hence find A,
A B and B ∩A.
18.3 Relationship between the numbers of elements in two sets
Shown below is a Venn diagram with two subsets A and B of the universal set such
that A∩B O. Here n1, n2 and n3 denote the number of elements in the respective
regions. (Though it is expected to write the elements inside the regions, we have
written down the number of elements for ease.)
Let us the denote the number of elements belonging to the subset A by n(A) etc.
Then, from the figure, we see that
n (A) = n1 + n2
n (B) = n2 + n3
n (A∩B) = n2
n (A∪B) = n1 + n2 + n3
Now, we write, n (A∪B) = n1 + n2 + n2 + n3 – n2
= n (A) + n (B) – n (A∩B)
Thus, we obtain the formula
n (A∪B) = n (A) + n (B) – n (A∩B)
The Venn diagram when the two subsets A and B are disjoint (i.e.,when
A∩B = O ) is shown below.
In this case, we see that
n (A) = n1
n (B) = n2
n (A∪B) = n1 + n2
Thus, when
O we obtain the formula
n (A∪B) = n (A) + n (B)
Example 1
Information on the numbers of students who participate in football and cricket
are shown in the following diagram (In this case too, the numbers in the regions
indicate the numbers of students in the regions).
Football
Cricket
How many students are
1. participating in football? n (F) = 8 +7 = 15
2. participating in cricket? n (C) = 7 + 15 = 22
3. participating in both sports (both football and cricket)? n (F ∩ C) = 7
4. participating in cricket only? n (C ∩ F ) = 15
5. participating in football only? n (F ∩ C ) = 8
6. participating in football or cricket (or both)? n (F ∪ C) = 8 + 7 + 15 = 30
7. not participating in football? n (F ) = 15 + 5 = 20
8. not participating in cricket? n (C ) = 8 + 5 = 13
9. participating in exactly in one of the two sports? n {(F ∩ C ) ∪ (F ∩ C )}
10. Participating in neither of the two sports? n (F ∪ C) = 5
= 8 + 15 = 23
Example 2
The information obtained through a survey from a set of farmers in a certain village
about the kind of crop they grow in their farms is shown in the following Venn
diagram.
Growing paddy ^X&
Growing vegetables ^Y&
(a) How many farmers are growing
1. vegetables? n (Y) = 25
2. paddy? n (X) = 7 + 25 = 32
3. only paddy? n (Y ∩X) = 7
4. only vegetables? n(X ∩Y) = 0
5. both vegetables and paddy? n (X∩Y) = 25
6. vegetables or paddy? n (X∪Y) = 7 + 25 = 32
7. neither of the two crops? n (X∪Y) = 13
(b) How many farmers were surveyed?
n (ε) = 13 + 7 + 25 = 45
