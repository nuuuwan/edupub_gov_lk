Reading expands your vocabulary. You also learn spelling
and grammatical structures.”

programmes such as discussions, news, debates, and
talk shows. Listening trains our ears and helps with our
pronunciation.”

prince.

with Eagle to be educated.

whole kingdom has been waiting for your return,” said the father. “Now tell
us how your education has prepared you for kingship.” “Father, I know about
all the needs of every bird, said the prince. “I know about the seeds they eat,
eggs they lay and how they find food and water. I can even teach our animals
how to build nests.” The old king shook his head sadly. He realized that his

Orpheus and Eurydice (A Greek Myth)
Once there was a famous musician called
Orpheus. He was considered the greatest
musician of the time. Apollo, the Greek god of
music, admired him very much and presented
him with a “lyre,” a musical instrument. No one
could resist his music. Humans and gods alike
were charmed by his music. It was said that even
wild beasts used to sit and listen to him.
Meanwhile Orpheus met a wood nymph called
Eurydice. Nymphs were supposed to be minor nature deities who looked like
beautiful women. They fell in love with each other and got married. They were
very happy. One day Eurydice had the misfortune of stepping on a snake. The
snake bit her and she died. Orpheus was heartbroken. He refused to accept that

his wife was dead. Orpheus was a brave man. He decided to go to the land of
the dead to bring his wife back. He was not afraid to take on such a perilous
journey.
After travelling for a long time, he reached the shores of the River Styx, the
river which separated the world of the living and the world of the dead. There,
he met Charon, the boatman of the underworld. Charon refused to take Orpheus
in his boat. “No one but the dead can enter the underworld”, he said. But clever
Orpheus, playing his lyre, persuaded Charon to row him across the river.
Then, he charmed Cerberus, the enormous three-headed guardian dog of the
underworld with his music. The dog let him pass.
Hades and Persephone, the king and the queen of the underworld were amazed
by the purpose of his visit. They were also enchanted by his music and felt sorry
for him. “I will give you one chance,” Hades said. He agreed to let Orpheus take
Eurydice back. “If you don’t look back until you reach the world of the living,
she will be yours. But if you break your promise, she will turn into a spirit
again,” Hades warned.
Orpheus agreed and began the journey. But, as he stepped from the cave of
the underworld, he became impatient. He turned back to look at his wife.
Sadly, Eurydice had not yet fully emerged. At once she sank back murmuring
“farewell.”

Folk tales
A folk tale is a story that originated in a particular culture, and has typically
passed on by word of mouth.
Read and enjoy the following folk tale.
Once there was a man who had four sons. They were always fighting with
each other. The father was worried and wanted to teach them a good lesson.
When he was very ill and lay
dying in his bed, he asked his
sons to come to him. When they
came, the old father gave them a
bundle of sticks and said, “Can
you break these sticks?”
Each one of them took the bundle.
The first son tried to break it, but
failed. He tried very hard and finally gave up. Then it was the turn of the second
son to try his luck. He thought it would be an easy task and picked up the bundle
easily. He tried his best to break it, but nothing happened. Then, the third son
tried to break it, but he couldn’t do anything either.
For free distribution Meanwhile, the youngest son jeered at his brothers and thought they were very
incompetent. He thought he was very clever and took one stick at a time and
easily broke all of them.
The old father then smiled at his sons and said, “Children, do you understand
what happened? It is always easy to break the sticks one by one, but when they
are bundled together, none of you could break them. In the same way, the four
of you should always be together. No one will be able to hurt you then.” The
four brothers realised what their father was trying to teach them and forgot all
their enmity and learnt that unity is strength.
From that day onwards, they never fought with each other and lived together in
peace and harmony.

We Are One
Simba:
As you go through life you'll see
There is so much that we
Don't understand
And the only thing we know
Is things don't always go
The way we planned
But you'll see everyday
That we'll never turn away
When it seems all your dreams
Come undone
We will stand by your side
Filled with hope and filled with pride
We are more than we are
We are one
Kiara:
If there's so much I must be
Can't I still just be me
The way I am?
Can I trust in my own heart
Or am I
Just one part
Of some big plan?
Simba:
Even those who are gone
Are with us as we go on
Your journey has only begun
Tears of pain, tears of joy
One thing nothing can destroy
Is our pride deep inside
We are one
We are one you and I
We are like the earth and sky
One family under the sun
All the wisdom to lead
All the courage that you need
You will find when you see
We are one
Family, family
