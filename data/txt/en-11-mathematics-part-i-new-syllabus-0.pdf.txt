This textbook has been compiled in accordance with the new syllabus to be
implemented from 2015.
Textbooks are compiled for students. Therefore, we have made an attempt to
compile this textbook in a simple and detailed manner making it possible for you to
read and understand it on your own.
We have included descriptions, activities and examples to introduce the subject
concepts in an attractive manner and to establish them. Moreover, activities are
organized from simple to complex to develop an interest to do them.
We have used the terms related to mathematical concepts in accordance with the
glossary of technical terms of mathematics compiled by the Department of Official
Languages.
Some subject matter learnt during the earlier grades is necessary to learn the subject
content in the grade 11 syllabus. Thus, review exercises are included at the begin-
ning of each chapter to revise previous knowledge. You will be prepared by them
for the subject content of grade 11.
In addition, students may use the grade 10 book which you have if you need
to recall previuos knoweledge.

² to investigate number sets
² workout basic mathematical operations regarding surds.
It is believed that the concept of numbers originated among the human race about
30 000 years ago. This concept which originated and developed independently in
various civilizations, evolved globally and has now become a universal field of
study named mathematics.
It can be assumed that numbers were initially used in early civilizations for simple
purposes such as counting and accounting. There is no doubt that the first numerical
concepts that were developed were “one” and “two”. Later the concepts of three,
four etc., must have been developed. Then man would have realized that he could
name any amount that he wished in this manner. Different civilizations used
different symbols to name numbers.
It is accepted based on historical evidence, that the numerals 1, 2, 3 etc., which we
now use, originated in India. The honour of being the first to use the concept of zero
as a number as well as being the first to introduce the positional decimal number
system also goes to India. This number system is now defined as the Hindu-Arabic
number system and the modern belief is that it was first taken to the Middle-East
and then to Europe by traders. This system is the standard number system which is
accepted and used worldwide now.
The manipulation of numbers using the basic mathematical operations (addition,
subtraction, multiplication and division) can be considered as a great revolution in
the history of mankind in relation to the use of numbers. In this age of technology it
is unimaginable to think of the existence of man without numbers and the operations
performed on them.
Although the numbers 1, 2, 3 etc., can be considered as the first numbers that were
used to fulfill certain needs of man, later the number zero, fractional numbers and
negative numbers were also included in the number system. During the period when
mathematics was developing as a separate field, the attention of mathematicians
was directed towards various other types of numbers (sets) too. In this lesson we
hope to study about such sets of numbers, their notations and properties.

For free distribution The Set of Integers ( )
It is natural that we identify initially the numbers 1, 2, 3, … which we first learnt
about as children. These numbers are defined as counting numbers and the set
which consists of all these numbers is written using set notation as follows.
{1, 2, 3, …}
The reason for this set of numbers to be called the counting numbers is very clear.
However its mathematical usage in modern times is limited. The name used most
often now for this set is “the set of positive integers”. This set is denoted by
+.
Thus, + = {1, 2, 3, ...}.
That is, the numbers 1, 2, 3, … are called positive integers.
The numbers defined as negative integers are – 1, – 2, – 3, etc. Although there is
no commonly used symbol to denote this set, some mathematicians, based on the
needs of their field of study, use the symbol
–.
The positive integers, zero and the negative integers together form the set of
. Accordingly,
integers. This set is denoted by
= { ..., – 3, – 2, – 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
or equivalently,
= {0, ±1, ±2, ±3, ...}.
The Set of Natural Numbers ()
Let us consider again the set of numbers 1, 2, 3,... This set is also defined as the set
'
of natural numbers and is denoted by

That is,

= {1, 2, ...}.
Note: There is no consensus among mathematicians regarding which numbers
should be considered as natural numbers. The suitability of calling the numbers
1, 2,3, … natural numbers is clear. However some of the mathematicians (especially
specialists in set theory), have considered 0 as a natural number in their books.
2
For free distribution
One reason may be because at that time there was no accepted name nor accepted
symbol for the set consisting of 0 and the positive integers.However most books on
number theory consider the set of natural numbers to be the set {1, 2, 3,...}.Almost
all authors of mathematics books now mention at the beginning of their books
which set of numbers they consider as the natural numbers.
The set of Rational Numbers ( )

1
We have come across earlier that, like the integers, fractions too can be considered
as numbers, and that operations such as addition and multiplication can be
performed on them too. Every integer can be written as a fraction. (For example,
we can write 2 =
). Further, a fraction can be written in different forms, all having
the same numerical value. (For example, 1
=
). We have also come across
2
2
, etc.&' Although we usually think that the numerator
negative fractions ^–
5
and denominator of a fraction should consist of integers, this is actually not the
case. For example, 3
is also a fraction. However, fractions with integers in both
2
the numerator and the denominator (apart from 0 in the denominator), have an
important place in mathematics. They are called rational numbers. The set of
rational numbers is denoted by
. Accordingly, the set of rational numbers can be
defined using the set builder notation as follows.
, – 11
3
=

4
={
a
b : a, b
and b ≠ 0 }.
There are other ways too of defining the set of rational numbers. One other way is
as follows.
={
a
b : a
, b
+ }.
Both these definitions are equivalent. Since the denominator of a rational number
cannot be 0 and since all the negative rational numbers can be obtained by
considering the fractions with the negative integers in the numerator and positive
integers in the denominator.

The Set of Irrational Numbers
It is appropriate to define the irrational numbers now. Do you recall how you learnt
about numbers in previous grades by drawing a number line? Let us reconsider
this now.
Let us consider a straight line which can be lengthened as required in either
direction. Let us name a point we like on that line as the origin 0. Let us assume
that we have marked all the numbers 1, 2, 3, etc., on one side of 0 (usually the right
hand side) and all the numbers – 1, – 2, – 3 etc., on the opposite side, keeping equal
gaps between the numbers. That is, let us assume that the points corresponding to
all the integers have been marked on this number line. Let us also assume that the
points corresponding to all the rational numbers too have been marked on this line.
The figure below shows several such points that have been marked.

– 1

Accordingly, all the rational numbers (including the integers) are now assumed
to have been marked on this line. Now, do you think that corresponding to each
point on the line, a number has been marked? If asked differently, do you think that
the distance from 0 to each point on the line can be written as a rational number?
In truth, there are several points remaining on the number line which have not
been marked. That is, there are points remaining on this number line that cannot
be represented by a rational number. It is clear that the points that are remaining
are those which correspond to the numbers which cannot be written in the form
a
, where a and b are integers. The numbers which correspond to the remaining
b
points are defined as irrational numbers.
, the complement of the set
There is no specific symbol to denote the set of irrational numbers and it is usually
. The numbers 2" 3" 5 can be
denoted by
given as examples of irrational numbers. In fact, the square root of any positive
integer which is not a perfect square is an irrational number. Apart from these,
mathematicians have proved that π, which is the ratio of the circumference of any
circle to its diameter, is also an irrational number. We take the value of π to be 22
7
as an approximate value, for the convenience of performing calculations.

The Set of Real Numbers ( )
According to the above discussion, all the numbers on a number line can be
represented by rational numbers or irrational numbers. We call all the rational
numbers together with all the irrational numbers, that is, all the numbers that can be
represented on a number line, the real numbers. The set of real numbers is denoted
by
.
The Decimal Representation of a Number
Any real number can be represented as a decimal number. Initially, let us consider
the decimal representation of several rational numbers.
1. The decimal representation of a rational number
4 = 4.000 ...
1
2 = 0.5 = 0.5000 ...
11
8
211
99

= 2.131313...
= 5.11333...
= 5.285714285714285714 ...
A common property of these decimal representations is that starting at a certain
point to the right of the decimal point (or from the beginning), one set of numerals
(or one numeral) is recurring. Recurring means that it keeps repeating itself.
For example, in the decimal representation of 1
, the numeral 0 recurs starting from
2
the second decimal place. The numeral 0 recurs from the first decimal place in the
decimal representation of 4, the pair of numerals 13 recurs from the beginning in
the decimal representation of 211
99
and the group of numerals 285714 recurs from
37
7 . This property, that is, a group
the beginning in the decimal representation of
of numerals recurring continuously, is a property common to all rational numbers.
If the portion that recurs is just 0, such a decimal representation is defined as a
finite decimal (or terminating decimal). The decimals of which the portion that
5

recurs is not zero, are called recurring decimals. Accordingly,
above example are finite decimals while the rest are recurring decimals.

The above discussion leads to the following statement.
Every rational number can be written as a finite decimal or a recurring
decimal.
Let us now learn a marvelous result regarding rational numbers. Suppose the
rational number a
b
b have no common factors. Then the denominator (that is, b) has only powers of
2 or 5 (or both) as its factors. A rational number which has a recurring decimal
representation must have a prime factor other than 2 and 5 in its denominator.
has a finite decimal representation. Let us assume that a and
Recurring decimals are written in a concise form, by placing a dot above a numeral
or numerals as shown in the following examples to indicate that they are recurring.

2. The decimal representation of an irrational number
Finally, let us consider the decimal representation of an irrational number. In the
decimal representation of an irrational number, no group of numerals recurs. For
example, when the decimal representation of 2 is written down up to 60 decimal
places, we obtain the following:
1.414213562373095048801688724209698078569671875376948073176679
π, which is a number we come across often is also an irrational number. When the
value of π is calculated up to 60 decimal places we obtain the following:
3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944
The following statements can be made regarding irrational numbers.
There is no group of recurring numerals in the decimal representation of an
irrational number. If the decimal representation of a number is not finite, it is
called an infinite decimal. Accordingly rational numbers which are recurring
decimals and irrational numbers have infinite decimal representations.
Note: When describing the decimal representation of irrational numbers, one
frequent error that is made is stating that “there is no pattern in the decimal
representation of an irrational number”. The issue here is that the word “pattern” is
not well defined in mathematics. For example, the following decimal number has
a very clear pattern.
0.101001000100001000001...
However, this is an irrational number, Observe that there is no group of recurring
numbers.
All the sets of numbers that have been studied so far can be represented in a Venn
diagram as follows, with the set of real numbers as the universal set, and the other
sets as its subsets. A few numbers belonging to each subset have been included to
make it easier for you to understand the relationship between the sets.

1.2 Surds
˜
There is no doubt that you recall how numerical (and algebraic) expressions are
˜ which is defined as the radical sign. For example,
written using the symbol
4 is defined as the positive square root of 4 and it represents the positive number
which when squared is equal to 4; that is 2. The positive square root is referred to
as square root too. If a certain positive integer x is such that its square root x is
also a positive integer, then x is defined as a perfect square. Accordingly, 4 is a
perfect square. Since 4 is equal to 2. However, 2 is not the square root of a
perfect square. We observed earlier that 2 is approximately equal to 1.414. We
also learnt earlier in this lesson that 2 is an irrational number. A numerical term
of which the value is not a rational number is defined as
involving the symbol
a surd.
˜ is used not only to denote the square roots of numbers,
The radical sign —
but also other roots. For example, 23
denotes the positive number which when
raised to the power 3 is equal to 2. This is called the cube root of 2. This is also an
irrational number. Its value is approximately 1.2599. (You can verify this by finding
the value of 1.25993). We can define the fourth root of 2 and the fifth root of 2 etc.,
in a similar manner. Such definitions can be made for other positive numbers as
well; for example, 53
. Such expressions are also surds. However, in
this lesson we will only consider surds which are square roots of positive integers.
6
and 8.24
The square root of a positive integer which is not a perfect square is neither a finite
decimal nor a recurring decimal. Observe that surds are therefore always irrational
numbers.
Here our focus is on simplifying expressions which involve surds. There are many
reasons why such simplifications are important. One reason is that it facilitates
1 , if we
calculations. For example, when it is necessary to find the value of
2
take 2 to be approximately equal to 1.414, we would need to find the value of
. This division is fairly long. However, by simplifying this in the following
^Multiplying the numerator and denominator by 2 &

manner, calculations are made easier.

2
2

= 0.707.

2

Another reason for simplifying surds is to minimize errors during calculations.
9
For free distribution
For example, let us find the value of 20
2
value for 20 , and 2.2 as an approximate value for 5 . Then
– 5 . Let us use 4.5 as an approximate
20
2
– 5 =
=
=
– 2.2
4.5
2
2.25 – 2.2
0.05
However, the actual value of this expression is 0. One reason for getting a different
answer is because we used approximate values for 20 and 5 . However, by
simplifying the above expression in a different way, we can get the correct value
which is 0.
Surds appear in various form.
A special feature of a surd of the form 20 is that the whole number is under the
radical sign. Such surds are defined as entire surds. 6 15 means 6 × 15. This
is a product of a surd and a rational number (not equal to 1). This is not an entire
surd.
A surd is in its simplest form when it is in the form a b ; where a is a rational
number and b has no factors which are perfect squares. For example 6 15 is in its
simplest form but 5 12 is not, since 4 which is a perfect square is a factor of 12.
Now let us consider how to simplify expressions that contain surds of various forms.
Example 1
Simplify 3 5 + 6 5 .
This can be simplified by considering 5 to be an unknown term.
3 5 + 6 5 = 9 5 .
This simplification is similar to the simplification 3x + 6x = 9x.
Observe that the expression obtained above in surd form cannot be simplified
further. Keep in mind that simplifying further by using an approximate value for
5 is not what is meant by simplifying surds.
You should also keep in mind the important fact that an expression of the form
3 2 + 8 3 cannot be simplified further.
Now let us through examples, consider how expressions with surds are simplified
by applying the properties of indices.

Next let us consider how multiplication and division are performed on surds.

Let us multiply the rational and irrational parts separately.
5 3 4 2 = 5 4 3 2
= 20 3 2
= 20 6
Example 5
Simplify: 3 20 ..2 5 .
The surd 3 20 can be written as 3 4 5 . Simplifying further, it can be written
as 3 2 5 = 6 5

for such expressions are
in the denominator.

2
Now let us consider how such an expression can be converted into an expression
with an integer (or a rational number) in the denominator.
Example 6
Express
3 as a fraction with an integer in the denominator.

The method used here is, to multiply both the numerator and the denominator of
3 by 2

Simplify 4 63 – 5 7 – 8 28 .
4 63 = 4 9 7 = 4 3 7
4 63 = 4 9 7 = 4 3 7
8 28 = 8 4 7 = 8 2 7
8 28 = 8 4 7 = 8 2 7
= 12 7
= 12 7
= 16 7
= 16 7
Therefore 4 63 – 5 7 – 8 28 = 12 7 – 5 7 – 16 7
Therefore 4 63 – 5 7 – 8 28 = 12 7 – 5 7 – 16 7

2.1 Fractional Indices of a Power
Square root of 4 can be written either using the radical symbol (square root symbol)
as 4√
or using powers as 4
Therefore, it is clear that 4√
= 4

Let us consider another example, similar to the above. As 2 = 21,
2 2 2 = 21 21 21
= 23
= 8
Third power of 2 is 8' Thus, the cube root of 8 is 2. This can be denoted symbolically
as"

8√
= 2
or 8

Therefore it is clear that 8√

2.2 Solving Equations with Indices
2x = 23 is an equation. Because the bases of the powers on either side of the equal
sign are equal, the exponents must be equal. Thus, from 2x = 23 , we can conclude
that x = 3'
Similarly, on either side of the equation x5 = 25 are powers with equal exponents.
Because the indices are equal, the bases are also equal. Therefore, from x5 = 25
we can conclude that x = 2' If x2 = 32 then the indices are equal but in this case,
both + 3 and − 3 are solutions. The reason for two solutions arising is because the
exponent — 2 ˜ is an even number. In this lesson, we will only consider powers with

a positive base. Thus, in expressions of the form xm , x > 0'
There is a special property of powers of 1. All powers of 1 are equal to 1. That is,
for any m, 1m = 1'
Let us summarise the above observations.
For x > 0, y > 0, y ≠ 1 and x ≠ 1,
if x ≠ 0 xm = xn, then m = n'
if m ≠ 0 and xm = ym, then x = y'
Let us use these rules to solve equations with indices.

(ii) x3 = 343

3 1 + 4x − 2 = 3−3x
∴ 1 + 4x − 2 = −3x
4x + 3x = 2 − 1

2.3 Laws of logarithms
We know that, using the laws of logarithms, we can write
log2 (16 32) = log216 + log232 and log2 (32 .. 16) = log232 – log216. These laws,
in general, can be written as follows.
loga (mn) = loga m + loga n
loga m
n
= loga m – loga n
Let us learn another law of a similar type.
Consider log51254 as an example.
log51254 = log5 (125
125 125 125)
= log5125 + log5125 + log5125 + log5125
= 4 log5125
Similarly,
log10105 = 5 log1010 and
log352 = 2 log35
This observation can be written, in general, as the following logarithmic law'
loga mr = r logam
This law is even valid for expressions with fractional indices. Given below are a
few examples, where this law is applied to powers with fractional indices.

103 = 1000 can be written using logarithms as log10 1000 = 3. As a convention
we write "lg" instead of "log10 ". Now we can express the above expression as
lg 1000 = 3. It is important to mention the base if it is other than 10'
For example"
log5 25 = 2 because 52 = 25,
lg 1 = 0 because 100 = 1" and
lg 10 = 1 because 101 = 10'
The logarithm of any positive number can be found using the table of logarithms.
Do the following exercise to refresh the memory on using logarithms to simplify
expressions involving multiplications and divisions of numbers.

3.1 Logarithms of decimal numbers less than one
Let us now consider how to use the table of logarithms to obtain the logarithms
of numbers between 0 and 1, by paying close attention to how we obtained the
logarithms of numbers greater than 1. For this purpose, carefully investigate the
following table.

According to the above table, the characteristic of the logarithm of numbers
inbetween 0 and 1, coming after 5.432 in the first column, are negative' Even
though the characteristic is negative, the mantissa of the logarithm, which is found
using the table, is a positive number. The symbol —−˜ is used above the whole part
to indicate that only the characteristic is negative. It is read as "bar".
For example, 2 −.3725 is read as "bar two point three, seven, two, five"' Moreover,
what is represented by 2 −.3725 is − 2 + 0.3725'
The characteristic of the logarithm of a number between 0 and 1 is negative. The
characteristic of the logarithm of such a number can be obtained either by writing
it in scientific notation or by counting the number of zeros after the decimal point.
The characteristic of the logarithm can be obtained by adding one to the number
of zeros after the decimal point (and before the next non-zero digit) and taking its
negative value. Observe it in the above table too.
Example
0.004302 Number of zeros after the decimal point and before the next
non-zero digit is 2. Therefore characteristic of the logarithm
is 3−
29
For free distribution
0.04302 Number of zeros after the decimal point is 1; thus the
characteristic of the logarithm is 2−
Number of zeros after the decimal point is 0; thus the
characteristic of the logarithm is 1−
0.4302
Therefore, lg 0.004302 = 3− .6337'
When written using indices, it is;
0.004302 = 103− .6337' This can also be written as" 0.004302 = 10 −3 100.6337'
Do the following exercise to practice taking logarithms of numbers between
0 and 1.

3.2 Number corresponding to a logarithm (antilog)
Let us recall how the antilog of a number greater than 1 is obtained.
antilog 2.7421 = 5.522 102
= 552.2
When a number is written in scientific form, the index of the power of 10 is the
characteristic of the logarithm of that number. The characteristic of the logarithm
indicates the number of places that the decimal point needs to be shifted when
taking the antilog.
Thus, we obtained 552.2 by shifting the decimal point of 5.522 two places to the
right. However, when the characteristic is negative the decimal point is shifted to
the left side.
30
For free distribution
antilog 2−. 7421 = 5.522 10 −2
= 0.05522
antilog 1−. 7421 = 5.522 10 −1
= 0.5522
Exercise 3.2
(Decimal point needs to be shifted 2 places to the
left)
(Because of bar 2, there is one 0 after the decimal
point)
(Decimal place needs to be shifted one place to
the left)
(Because of bar 1, there are no zeros after the
decimal place)

form.

3.3 Addition and subtraction of logarithms with negative
characteristics
(a) Addition
The mantissa of a logarithm is obtained from the table of logarithms and is always
positive. But we now know that, the characteristic can be positive, negative or
zero. In 2−. 5143, the mantissa, .5143, is positive and the characteristic, 2−, is
negative' When adding or subtracting such numbers, it is important to simplify the
characteristic and the mantissa separately.
Example 1
Simplify and express the answer in log form.
(i) 2−. 5143 + 1−. 2375
(i) 2−. 5143 + 1−. 2375
(ii) 3−. 9211 + 2 . 3142
(iii) 3−. 8753 + 1−. 3475
= − 2 + 0.5143 + ( − 1 ) + 0.2375
= (− 2 − 1) + (0.5143 + 0.2375)
= − 3 + 0.7518
= 3−. 7518

For free distribution
(ii) 3−. 9211 + 2 . 3142
(iii) 3− . 8753 + 1.3475
= − 3 + 0.9211 + 2 + 0.3142
= (− 3 + 2) + (0.9211 + 0.3142)
= − 1 + 1.2353
= − 1 + 1 + 0.2353
= 0.2353
= − 3 + 0.8753 + 1 + 0.3475
= (− 3 + 1) + (0.8753 + 0.3475)
= − 2 + 1.2228
= − 2 + 1 + 0.2228
= 1−. 2228
(b) Subtraction
As in addition, logarithms should be subtracted from right to left, remembering that
the mantissa is positive.
Example 2
Simplify and express the answer in log form.
(i) 2−. 5143 − 1.3143 = − 2 + 0.5143 − (1 + 0.3143)
= − 2 + 0.5143 − 1 − 0.3143
= − 2 − 1 + 0.5143 − 0.3143
= − 3 + 0 . 2000
= 3−. 2000
(ii) 2. 5143 − 1−. 9143 = 2 + 0.5143 − (− 1 + 0.9143)
= 2 + 0.5143 + 1 − 0.9143
= 3 − 0.4000
= 2.6000
(iii) 0.2143 − 1−. 8143 = 0.2143 − (− 1 + 0.8143)
= 0.2143 + 1 − 0.8143
= 1 − 0.6000
= 0.4
(iv) 2−. 5143 − 1−. 9143 = − 2 + 0.5143 − (− 1 + 0.9143)
= − 2 + 0.5143 + 1 − 0.9143
= − 2 + 1 + 0.5143 − 0.9143
= −1 − 0.4000
32
For free distribution
In the above example, the decimal part is negative. Because we need the decimal
part of a logarithm to be positive, we will use a trick as follows to make it positive.
− 1 − 0.4 = − 1 − 1 + 1 − 0.4 (Because − 1 + 1 = 0, we have not changed the value')
= − 2 + 0.6
= 2− . 6
Actually what we have done is add − 1 to the characteristic and + 1 to the mantissa.
Note: We could have avoided getting a negative decimal part by doing the
simplification as follows.
− 2 + 0.5143 + 1 − 0.9143 = − 2 + 1.5143 − 0.9143 = − 2 + 0.6 = 2− . 6

∴ P = antilog 1.5189

b. 0.0034 × 0.8752
Take P = 0.0034 × 0.8752.
Then,
lg P = lg (0.0034 × 0.8752)

3.5 Multiplication and division of a logarithm of a number by a
whole number
We know that the characteristic of a number greater than one is positive. Multiplying
or dividing such a logarithm by a number can be done in the usual way.
We know that the characteristic of the logarithm of a number between 0 and 1 is
negative. 3−. 8247 is such a logarithm. When multiplying or dividing a logarithm
with a negative characteristic by a number, we simplify the characteristic and the
mantissa separately.

Division of a logarithm by a whole number
Let us now consider how to divide a logarithm by a whole number. When the
characteristic of a logarithm is negative the characteristic and the mantissa carry
negative and positive values respectively. Therefore, it is important to divide the
positive part and the negative part separately. Let us now consider some examples
of this type.

The table of logarithms can be used to do computations efficiently in many problems
that involve products and divisions of numbers. Such an example is given below.
Example 1

πr3 ' By taking π = 3.142
3
and given that r = 0.64 cm" use the table of logarithms to find the volume of the
sphere to the nearest first decimal place.

= 0.6021 + 0.4972 + 3 1−.8062 – 0.4771
= 0.6021 + 0.4972 + 1−.4186 – 0.4771
= 0.5179 – 0.4771
= 0.0408
∴ V = antilog 0.0408
= 1.098
≈ 1.1 (to the nearest first decimal place)
∴ The volume of the sphere is 1.1 cm3.

3.9 Using a calculator
Logarithms have been used for a long time to do complex numerical computations.
However, its use has now been replaced to a great extent by calculators. Computations
that can be done using an ordinary calculator is limited. For complex computations
one needs to use a scientific calculator. The keyboard of a scientific calculator is
much more complex than that of an ordinary calculator.
Evaluating powers using a calculator:
5213 can be computed by entering 521 521 521 into an ordinary calculator.
However, this can be computed easily using a scientific calculator, by either using
the key indicating xn or by

Surface area of solids
By studying this lesson you will be able to"
² find the surface area of a right pyramid with a square base,
² find the surface area of a right circular cone, and
² find the surface area of a sphere.
Pyramid
Carefully observe the solid objects in the above figure. Note that their faces are
polygons. Of these faces, the horizontal face at the bottom is called the base. All the
faces, except the base are of triangular shape. The common point of these triangular
faces is called the "apex". A solid object with these properties is called a "pyramid".
Note that the bases of the Pyramids shown above are respectively, the shape of a
quadrilateral, a pentagon and a hexagon.
Right pyramid with a square base
Slant
edge
Triangular face
Perpendicular
height
The base of the pyramid in the figure is a
square. All the remaining faces are triangular
in shape. If the line segment connecting the
apex and the midpoint of the square base (that
is the intersection point of the two diagonals)
is perpendicular to the base, then such a
pyramid is called a "square based right
pyramid". The length of the line segment
connecting the apex and the midpoint of the
base is called the perpendicular height (or
simply the height) of the pyramid. The edges of the triangular faces which are not
common to the base are called slant edges. In this lesson, we will only consider
finding the surface area of square based right pyramids.

tetrahedron are triangular in shape. Any one of the faces can be taken as the base.
The concept of —right pyramid˜ can be defined even when the base is not a square.
For example, we can define a right pyramid when the base of a pyramid is a
regular polygon, as follows. First note that all the axes of symmetry of a regular
polygon pass through a common point, which is called the centroid of the regular
polygon. A pyramid, having a base which is a regular polygon, is called a right
pyramid, if the line segment connecting the apex and the centroid of the base is
perpendicular to the base.
If you study mathematics further, you will learn how to define the centroid, even
when the base is not a regular polygon.
An important property of a square based right pyramid is that all its triangular faces
are congruent to each other. Therefore, all the triangular faces have the same area.
Moreover, note that each triangular face is an isosceles or an equilateral triangle,
with one side a side of the square base and the other two sides equal in length.
4.1 Surface area of a square based right pyramid
To find the total surface area of a square based right pyramid we need to add the
areas of the base and the four triangular faces.
Suppose the length of a side of the square base is —a˜ and the perpendicular height
of a triangular face is "l".

Cone
Shown above are some conical (cone shaped) objects. A cone has a circular
plane surface and a curved surface. The circular plane surface is called the base of
the cone. The point through which all the straight lines drawn on the curved surface

circle is called the radius of the cone. The
length of the line segment connecting the

the apex and a point on the perimeter of the base circle is called a generator of the
cone. The length of a generator is called the "slant height " of the cone.

It is customary to use —r˜ for the radius, —h˜ for the height and —l˜ for the slant height
of a cone.
4.2 Surface area of a right circular cone
To explain a method to find the surface area of a right circular cone, consider a
hollow right circular cone made from a thin sheet. Observe that the base of such a
cone is a circular plane surface. Cutting open the curved surface along a generator,
gives a lamina, the shape of a circular sector.
Given the radius and the slant height of a right circular cone, one can find surface
area of the cone, by finding the area of the circular base and the area of the curved
surface. We can use the formula πr2 to find the area of the circular base. We can find
the area of the circular sector as follows.

Circular base
The surface area of the curved surface is equal to the area of the sector that is
obtained by cutting it open. Because the arc length of the sector is the circumference
of the base circle, the arc length of the sector is equal to 2πr. Also note that the
radius of this sector is the slant height —l˜. Now, as you have learned in the lesson
on the perimeter of a circular sector in Grade 10, if the angle of the sector is θ then
θ

The area of the sector with the above angle θ (as learnt in grade 10) is θ

By substituting θ from the above equation, we get
area of the curved surface of the cone is πrl.

There is no doubt that you know what properties a sphere has. In mathematics,
a sphere is defined as the set of points in three dimensional space that lies at a
constant distance from a fixed point. The fixed point is called the centre of the
sphere and the constant distance from the centre to a point on the sphere is called
the radius of the sphere. A sphere has only one curved surface, and has no edges or
vertices.

R
When the sphere is inside the circumscribing cylinder,
any two planes parallel to the flat circular surfaces
of the cylinder will bound equal surface areas on the
curved surfaces of the sphere and cylinder.
For example, in the above figure, the area of the curved surface PQRS on the sphere
is the same as the area of the curved surface ABCD on the cylinder.
Now, if we apply this fact to the entire cylinder, we see that the surface area of
the sphere is equal to the surface area of the curved surface of the cylinder. We
can use the formulae 2πrh to find the surface area of the curved surface of the
circumscribing cylinder.
Area of the curved surface of the circumscribing cylinder = 2πr 2r
= 4πr2
Therefore, the surface area of the sphere = 4πr2

5.3 Volume of a sphere
Recall the circumscribing cylinder of a sphere, that we leaned about in the lesson on
the surface area of a sphere. Archimedes, the Greek mathematician who explained
the surface area of a sphere in terms of the circumscribing cylinder, also explained
the volume of a sphere in terms of the volume of the circumscribing cylinder. Let
us do the following activity to understand his finding.
Activity
Find a small sphere of radius 3 cm. Using a piece of cardboard, create a cylinder
with the same radius as that of the sphere and height equal to the diameter of the
sphere. Do not close the two ends of the cylinder. Now carefully insert the sphere
into the cylinder.

not ocupied by the sphere with sand. Cover top with a piece of cardboad and flip it
over and fill the remaining part that is not occupied by the sphere also with sand.
Put the total amount of sand that you used to fill the remaining volume of the
cylinder after inserting the sphere into the cone that you made earlier. Note that the
volume of sand fills the cone completely.

Let us formulate what you have observed in this activity.
Volume of the Circumscribing Cylinder = Volume of the Sphere + Volume of the
Cone
Therefore, we can find the volume of the sphere by subtracting the volume of the
cone from the volume of the circumscribing cylinder.
Volume of the Sphere = Volume of the Circumscribing Cylinder – Volume of the

Binomial Expressions
By studying this lesson, you will be able to
expand the cube (third power) of a binomial expression.
You have learned in earlier lessons that, for a binomial expression of the form
x + y, its square is denoted by (x + y)2, and that what it means is (x + y) (x + y),
and that when the product is expanded, the expression x2 + 2xy + y2 is obtained.
Moreover, recall that x2 – 2xy + y2 is obtained when (x – y)2 is expanded.
Do the following exercise to recall what you have learned about the expansion of
squares of binomial expressions.

Carefully observe how the following expressions, involving a power of 3, are
written.
33 = 3 × 32 = 3 × 3 × 3 = 27
x3 = x × x 2 = x × x × x
(2x)3 = (2x) × (2x)2 = (2x) × (2x) × (2x) = 8x3
In a similar way, we can write
(x + 1)3 = (x + 1)(x + 1)2 = (x + 1) (x + 1) (x + 1)
(a – 2)3 = (a – 2)(a – 2)2 = (a – 2) (a – 2) (a – 2)
(3 + m)3 = (3 + m)(3 + m)2 = (3 + m) (3 + m) (3 + m)
The cube of a binomial expression can be expanded in a way similar to how the
square of a binomial expression was expanded. It is illustrated in the following
example'
Example 1
(x + y)3 = (x + y) (x + y) 2
= (x + y) (x2+ 2xy +y2)
= x3 + 2x2y + xy2 + x2y + 2xy2 + y3
= x3 + 3x2y + 3xy2 + y3
Accordingly, let us remember the following pattern as a formula for the expansion
of the cube of the binomial expression (x + y).
(x + y)3 = x3 +3x2y + 3xy2 +y3
cube of the first term
cube of the
second term

square of the first term and the

Similarly, we can write (a + 2)3 = a3 + 3a2 × 2 + 3a × 22 + 23, and this can be further
simplified as "
a3 + 6a2 + 12a + 8
Now let us consider how the expansion of (x – y)3 is obtained by taking products.
(x – y)3 = (x – y) (x – y)2
= (x – y) (x2– 2xy +y2)
= x3 – 2x2y + xy2 – x2y +2xy2 – y3
= x3 – 3x2y + 3xy2 – y3
Now, let us consider how we can obtain the expansion of (x – y)3, using another
method.
First, note that we can write x – y as x + (– y)' Therefore, we can treat (x – y)3 as
an expression of the initial form, by writing it as {x + (– y)}3' Let us now consider
the expansion of this cube.
(x – y)3 = {x + (– y)}3 = x3 + 3 × x2 × (– y) + 3 × x × (– y)2 + (– y)3
= x3 – 3x2y + 3xy2 – y3
Note that we have used the properties (– y)2 = y 2 and (– y)3 = – y 3 in the above
simplification.
According to this, we can also write
(m – n)3 = m3 – 3m2n + 3mn2 – n3
(p – q)3 = p3 – 3p2q + 3pq2 – q3
Either method can be used to obtain the expansion of (x – y)3. You may use any
method which is easy for you.
Let us now consider how the cube of a binomial expression, involving numbers as
well, is expanded.
Example 2
Example 3
(x + 5)3 = x3 + 3 × x2 × 5 + 3 × x × 52 + 53
= x3 + 15x2 + 75x + 125

fractions are multiplied. Let us consider the following example.

What we mean by performing the multiplication is to express this product as a
single fraction.
To perform this multiplication, we multiply the numerators and denominators of
the two fractions separately, and obtain a single fraction. That is,

x x×

If the terms in the numerator and the denominator can be further simplified, by
doing the simplification we can express the answer in the simplest form. These
simplifications can be done either before multiplying the fractions or after
multiplying the fractions. Let us now consider multiplying two fractions where
such simplifications are possible.

7.2 Dividing an algebraic fraction by another algebraic fraction
Recall how you obtained the answer when dividing one fraction by another
fraction. You multiplied the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction.
Similarly, when dividing an algebraic fraction by another algebraic fraction, we can
instead multiply the first by the reciprocal of the second.
Before we study how algebraic fractions are divided, let us consider the reciprocal
of an algebraic fraction.
Reciprocal of an algebraic fraction
Recall the facts we have leaned regarding the reciprocal of a number. If the product
of two numbers is 1, then each number is the reciprocal or the multiplicative inverse
of the other number.
Because 2 × 2
1 = 1, reciprocal of 2 is
1 and reciprocal of
2
1 is 2.
2
Because × 33
Because × 5 4
1
4
= 1, reciprocal of
1 is 3 and reciprocal of 3 is
3
4 is
5 = 1, reciprocal of
5
5 and reciprocal of
4
1 .
3
5 is
4
4 .
5

Areas of Plane Figures
between Parallel Lines
By studying this lesson you will be able to
identify the theorems on the relationships between the areas of triangles and
parallelograms on the same base and between the same pair of parallel lines,
and solve problems related to them.
Introduction
You have already learnt about various plane figures and how the areas of certain
special plane figures are found. Let us now recall how the areas of triangles and
parallelograms are found.
When finding the areas of triangles and parallelograms, the terms altitude and base
are used. Let us first recall what these terms mean.
Let us consider the given triangle ABC and the parallelogram PQRS.

When finding the area of a triangle, any one of its sides can be considered as the
base. For example, the side BC of the triangle ABC can be considered as the base.
Then AD is the corresponding altitude; that is, the perpendicular dropped from the
vertex A to the side BC.
We know that,
area of triangle ABC =
1
2
BC AD.
Similarly, if we consider the side AB to be the base, the corresponding altitude is
CE. Accordingly, we can also write,
area of triangle ABC =
1
2
AB CE.
We can similarly find the area of the triangle ABC by taking AC as the base and
drawing the corresponding altitude from the vertex B.

For free distribution
Now let us consider the parallelogram PQRS. Here too, the area can be found by
considering any one of the sides as the base. If we consider the side QR as the base,
the corresponding altitude is the line segment PM. The length of PM is the distance
between the two parallel straight line segments QR and PS, the side opposite QR.
We know that,
the area of parallelogram PQRS = QR PM.
Similarly, if we consider the side PQ as the base, the corresponding altitude is RN.
Therefore we can also write,
the area of parallelogram PQRS = PQ RN.
Note
The length of the altitude of a triangle or a parallelogram is also often called the
altitude.
To recall what has been learnt earlier regarding finding the areas of parallelograms
and triangles, do the following exercise by applying the above facts.

Let us see whether the areas of the parallelograms ABCD and ABEF are equal.
Observe that,
area of parallelogram ABCD = area of trapezium ABCF + area of triangle AFD
area of parallelogram ABEF = area of trapezium ABCF + area of triangle BEC
Therefore it is clear that, if
the area of triangle AFD = the area of triangle BEC,
then the areas of the two parallelograms will be equal.
In fact, these two triangles are congruent. Therefore their areas are equal. The
congruence of the two triangles under the conditions of SAS can be shown as
follows.
In the two triangles AFD and BEC,

Theorem: Parallelograms on the same base and between the same pair of parallel
lines are equal in area.
Now let us obtain an important result using this theorem. You have used the
following formula when finding the area of a parallelogram in previous grades and
in the above exercise.
Area of a parallelogram = Base Perpendicular height
Have you ever thought about how this result was obtained? We can now use the
above theorem to prove this result.
The figure depicts a rectangle ABCD (that is, a parallelogram) and a parallelogram
ABEF on the same base and between the same pair of parallel lines. According to
the above theorem, their areas are equal.

Let us now consider how calculations are done using this theorem.

(ii) What is the area of the parallelogram ABCD?
(iii) Find the perpendicular distance between the parallel lines AB and FC.
Now let us answer these questions.
(i) ABEF and ABCD.
(ii) Since the parallelograms ABEF and ABCD lie on the same base AB and between
the same pair of parallel lines AB and FC, their areas are equal. Therefore, the
area of ABCD = 80 cm2.
(iii) Let us take the perpendicular distance between the pair of parallel lines as
h centimetres.
Then,
area of ABEF = AB h.
80 = 8 h
... h = 10
... the perpendicular distance between the parallel lines is 10 cm.
Now, by considering an example, let us see how riders are proved using this theorem.

^ii& Since the parallelograms ABQD and ABCP lie on the same base AB and

Now let us draw a line parallel to AB through the point C, as shown in the figure,

line drawn through C parallel to AB, as D.

The area of the triangle ABC is exactly half the area of the parallelogram ABDC.
This is because the diagonals of a parallelogram divide the parallelogram into two
congruent triangles. We learnt this in the lesson on parallelograms in Grade 10.
Therefore,

2
area of triangle ABC =
the area of parallelogram ABDC.
In section 8.2 of this lesson, we learnt that the areas of parallelograms on the same
base and between the same pair of parallel lines are equal. Therefore, in relation to
the above figure, the area of any parallelogram that lies on the same base AB and
between the same pair of parallel lines AB and CD is equal to the area of ABDC.
Therefore,
area of triangle ABC =
(area of any parallelogram with base AB lying between

the parallel lines AB and CD).
This result is given below as a theorem.

As discussed in section 8.3 the parallelogram related to the triangle PQR is PQRS,
and the parallelogram related to the triangle TQR is TQRU.
Since the parallelogram related to the triangle PQR is PQRS,
area of triangle PQR =

the area of parallelogram PQRS.
Since the parallelogram related to the triangle TQR is TQRU,
area of triangle TQR =

the area of parallelogram TQRU.
However, since the parallelograms PQRS and TQRU lie on the same base QR and
between the same pair of parallel lines, by the theorem,
area of parallelogram PQRS = area of parallelogram TQRU.

That is, area of triangle PQR = area of triangle TQR.
As stated previously, the areas of the two triangles PQR and TQR which lie on the
same base QR and between the same pair of parallel lines AB and CD are equal in
area.
Triangles which satisfy the above given conditions in this manner are equal in area.
This is stated as a theorem as follows.
