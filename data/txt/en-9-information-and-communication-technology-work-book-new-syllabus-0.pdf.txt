Using functions
To calculate the values in a range of cells, functions are used. After the ''=''
symbol, to begin a formula, the function is included. Then the cell range is
included within brackets. To indicate that it is a cell range, the names of the
ﬁ rst cell and the last cell are written within and the symbol '':''.
Let us identify a few such functions;
To calculate the total sum in a cell range
= sum(ﬁ rst cell:last cell).
To ﬁ nd the average in a cell range,
= average(ﬁ rst cell:last cell).
To count the cells with numbers only
= count(ﬁ rst cell:last cell).
To count cells with data in a cell range, use
= counta(ﬁ rst cell:last cell).

Let us use the relevant functions in the worksheet created above.
Open “Mark Sheet 1” that you created and saved earlier.
² File → Open → First term marks - 1 → Open

user in the network. In this, sending messages using the Connect Line
Interface (CLI) is used.
² Consider sending the message ‘Hello, how are you?’ to other users in the
network, using the CLI in Windows 10.

Remember to give correct user name and correct “msg” message. Let us try
sending a message.
² Assume that the message is, “Hello, how are you?” and the user name of
the receiver is 'student 1'.
² The system of using the msg command is msg user name message
Therefore, in the command line, you need to type ‘msg student 1 hello
how are you?’
² The command, user name and message require spaces in between.
Step 3 - On the Command Line, type ‘msg student 1 Hello, how are you?’

In the previous activity you used the user name of receiver student 1 after
msg command.
² However in here, instead of one user, * mark for 'all' is used.
² Therefore, the command you need to type is msg * Hello, how are you?
² Type correctly on the Command Interface and press Enter.
² All users of the network will receive the message. Use this command to
send diﬀ erent messages.
