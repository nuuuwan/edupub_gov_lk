Let us maintain correct posture
We engage in different activities in our daily life. Standing, sitting and lying down are
known as static postures. Walking, running and jumping are referred to as dynamic
postures. If these postures are not maintained properly we may have to face many
ailments and diseases. To avoid this let us have a proper understanding on how to
maintain correct posture in our daily activities. By maintaining correct posture, we
can be more efficient in our activities.It also helps us in reducing pressure on the
joints, muscles and other parts of the body and maintaining a pleasant appearance.
To maintain an effective posture we should apply our knowledge on bio mechanics.
In the previous classes we learnt about correct posture that helps maintain a healthy
life. In this chapter we learn the principles of bio mechanics and its effects on
posture.
Bio mechanical factors related to posture
There are two main bio mechanical factors that are related to posture in our daily
activities
1. Centre of gravity
2. Balance
1. Centre of gravity
Any object, as well as the human body is made up of tiny particles. All these tiny
particles have a weight. The weight of these objects act around a single point. This
point is called centre of gravity.
The centre of gravity of an object or human body, is a point where the whole weight
of an object/body is concentrated.

Figure 3.1
In any posture, we adopt the weight of the body acts around a single point and that
point becomes the centre of gravity.
According to a person’s posture, the centre of gravity changes temporarily.
A person standing straight with hands by the side will have his/her centre of
gravity at a distance of about 56% of the total height measured from the ground
(figure 3.2). Although the centre of gravity normally appears as described above, it
could change temporarily according to the posture of the body.
centre of gravity
Figure 3.2
This happens as the weight spreads in different directions. When a person stands
with both arms by the side and then raises the arms up the weight is spread to the
upper part of the body. So the position of the centre of gravity goes higher (figure
3.3c). Study the changes in the centre of gravity that occur when both arms are
stretched out on either sides of the body, only when the right hand is stretched out,
both arms are raised, the body is bending forward and at the start of a race (figur
3.3).

2. Balance
Figure 3.3
The state of a body or physical system
that is at rest or in constant and
unchanging motion is called balance.
When an equal force is applied on either
side of it, it will maintain its balance.
Figure 3.4
e.g: a see-saw shown in figure 3.4 is in a
balanced position. This is because the forces that act on either side of the centre of
gravity is equal and is in a balanced position. If a weight is put only to one side of
the see-saw, it will lose its balance and there will be a movement around the centre
of gravity.
Factors that help maintain the balance at different body postures are given below.
i. Keeping the line of gravity within the supporting base - vertical line passing
through the centre of gravity is called the line of gravity.
ii. Having the centre of gravity at a lower position (closer to the ground)
iii. Maintaining a wider supporting base
iv. Movement of the body in the opposite direction when loss of posture is
imminent
v. Bending the body towards an external force
Let us see how the above factors affect different postures
i. Keeping the line of gravity within the supporting base
A person standing with both legs together, bends his body forward without bending
the knees and waist at one point will tend to lose his balance and fall forward
(figure 3.5).

Supporting base
Figure 3.5
Standing with both legs together, the centre of gravity is vertically above the feet.
That is to say, the line of gravity stays within the supporting base. When bending
forward, the vertical line on the centre of gravity goes away from the base of the
feet. As it passes the peripheral margin of the base, the body loses it’s balance and
falls.
centre of gravity
Figure 3.6
In gymnastics, the player’s centre of gravity should be positioned above the
supporting base (figure 3.6). When the body bends in a certain direction, the centre
of gravity moves in that direction to prevent falling, maintaining the line of gravity
within the supporting base. By moving the centre of gravity towards it, the player
balances his body.
Figure 3.7
The above two figures in 3.7, show the start of the short distance race and a
gymnastics movement. In both situations the centre of gravity of the player’s body
is placed above the supporting base. Therefore in both situations the body is well
balanced.
ii. The centre of gravity at a lower level
When the centre of gravity is placed at a lower level it helps to maintain the balance
of the object. The centre of gravity of the object in figure 3.8 a is at a lower level
than the object shown in figure 3.8 b. The beaker in 3.8 a is in a more balanced
position. If it were to lose its balance and fall, the centre of gravity of that object
has to move a considerable distance but with a slight push the line of gravity of
the object shown in figure 3.8 b can be moved away from the supporting base and
topple easily.

Figure 3.8
When a basketball player bends his knees, his centre of gravity is at a lower position
than the centre of gravity of a player who is standing vertically and the first player
is better balanced. (3.9 a and b)

Figure 3.9
After an athlete has released the put, he always moves his body forward and
downwards. This helps the player to balance his body by keeping the centre of
gravity in a lower position (3.10 a). Figure 3.10 b shows how a gymnast carries the
centre of gravity to a lower position to maintain balance.

iii. Wider supporting base
Figure 3.10
When the supporting base of an object is wider it's balance also increases. We can
see a better balance in a person who is standing, with feet wide apart than the person
who is standing keeping the feet close together. The reason for this is the wider
supporting base. (figure 3.11)
Figure 3.11
It is very clearly shown in figure 3.11 that when the ground area of the supporting
base increases the equilibrium also increases. Figure 3.11a shows the player’s feet
kept close to each other. Here the size of the supporting base is small. In a situation
like this, the player’s position is not stable. Even a small external push can make
him lose his balance. If the player’s feet are kept as shown in 3.11b, his stability
is more. As shown in 3.11c, apart from keeping the feet wide apart, keeping one
hand on the ground, will increase the size of the supporting base. Furthermore, it
brings the position of the centre of gravity to a lower level making it a more stable
position.
Figure 3.12
Figure 3.12 shows a netball player and a weight lifter keeping their feet apart. Due
to a wider supporting base they have more stability in their stance.
iv. Movement of the body in the opposite directions.
When a part of the body moves far from the line of gravity the body may lose its
balance. Moving another part of the body in the opposite direction, the former
position can be balanced. The player in diagram 3.13, while stretching his left hand
forward has his left leg and hand stretched backward. By doing this he balances his
body.
v. Bending the body towards an external force.
Figure 3.13
When an external force is coming towards you by leaning forward, you can have a
better balance. If you bend your body backwards to an external force then the centre
of gravity will be pushed backwards away from the base of your body and balance
will be lost. This is explained by the two positions shown in figure 3.14
Figure 3.14
Maintaining posture according to bio mechanical factors
When we engage in static postures in our day-to-day life the centre of gravity and
balance are very important and attention should be paid to it. Let us study some
situations where the centre of gravity and balance are applied.
Standing
At the beginning of this chapter you studied that the centre of gravity of a person
in standing posture is at a distance of about 56% of height above the level of the
ground (figure 3.2).
In general a female’s centre of gravity is below that of a male’s. This is an advantage
for females to maintain balance. A child’s centre of gravity is situated at a higher
level than of an adult.
When standing if the hands are moved, the centre of gravity changes. When standing
for a long time, having a wider support of base, helps to maintain good balance.
Therefore when we stand the following points should be considered:
Figure 3.15
• Body is kept in a vertical stance
• Hands are kept on either side of the body
• Keep the feet apart, at an equal distance of the shoulder and direct the body
weight to spread equally to both feet
When standing and attending to any work remember to:
• keep the body in a vertical stance
• keep feet apart at an equal distance of the shoulder maintaining the balance
adjust the working surface to the level of the elbow (e.g: ironing)
Not keeping the back straight, being hunched,
leaning forward and working for a long time will
result in injury to the muscles and ligaments of
the vertebral column. A long term problem is
kyphosis that can arise due to the spine bending
forward.
Figure 3.16
Sitting
This is a common posture that we adopt in our daily life. When sitting the position
of our centre of gravity is as shown below (3.17).
Figure 3.17
When sitting, the centre of gravity is placed at a lower position than standing. The
body weight acts on the pelvis and because the centre of gravity lies at a lower
level the body is balanced well. For studying purposes and resting purposes we sit
in our day to day posture.
Points to consider when sitting :
• Keep the spine vertically
• Waist, knees and ankles should be bent at 90 degrees
• The soles of the feet should be touching the floor
• Use a properly designed chair with
- a back rest to lean
- the height of the chair equal to the height of knee from its feet
- sitting surface not soft or too hard
- handrests to rest the elbow.
Let us learn more on the position of sitting, in which we engage a lot in daily life.
Sitting and working at a table
• Sit closer to the table.
If the chair is higher than the normal height, we need to bend forward. So the
chair should be in a position where the feet are touching the floor. The table
surface should be at the level of your elbows. The distance between the table
and the seat should be at least 20 cm.
• Keep the spine vertical.
• Feet should touch the ground.
• Hip and knee joints should be bent at 90
degrees
If sitting for a long time, it is important to
get up and walk from time to time. This will
prevent undue pressure on the spinal cord.
Driving a vehicle
• Sit on the driver’s seat with a relaxed body.
• Hands bent slightly at the elbows.
• Keep back straight and rest completely
against the backrest.
• Legs should be in a relaxed position when
using brakes.
While working at the computer
Figure 3.18
• Chair should be one inch higher than the
Figure 3.19
usual height.
• Spine should be vertical.
• Head should not be swayed forward or
backward unnecessarily.
• Feet should touch the floor.
• Shoulder should be parallel to the hip bone.
• Change your posture every half an hour.
Standing, walking, stretching hands should
be done.
In all the situations mentioned above, the
seat should be a well-balanced one and it is
compulsory to sit in a balanced position in order
to prevent neck pains, wrist aches, stress to the
eyes and pain in the hands.
Figure 3.20
Lying down
Lying down is done in many ways in our day-to-day life. It is a natural static
position. According to the need, place and facilities available the posture changes.
Therefore the posture of lying down when asleep, when sick, after an accident and
at rest would differ.
When we lie down, we usually stay in a straight position facing up, facing down
or turning to the left or to the right side. The correct position to lie down is to be
straight and face up or turn to left or right side. If we follow this method, the centre
of gravity lies closer to the body as well as to the surface of the lying area. As a
result of this the balance of the body increases.
Pay attention to the following points when you are lying down.
• The air way should not be obstructed when lying.
• The circulatory process should not be obstructed.
• Lying down in such a way that it does not give any aches and pains to the body.
• A horizontal, flat and medium soft surface should be used in order to avoid
muscle related problems.
• Lying down should not affect the curves of the spine or muscles of the back.
It is important to follow the correct posture of sitting, standing and lying down in
our daily life.

Dynamic Postures
The centre of gravity and the body balance are very important aspects in dynamic
postures such as walking, running, jumping and throwing.
While running or walking, the body balance is maintained
by moving the hands and legs in the opposite directions.
Figure 3.21
The path a jumper takes in his flight indicates the path of the centre of gravity of
his body.
Figure 3.22
At the landing stage, when a jumper is about to land, he raises his legs forward and
upwards while bending the upper body forward and downwards. The equal and
opposite movements made during the flight are important in maintaining the body
balance of the jumper. Such movements do not cause any change in the path that
the centre of gravity of the body of the jumper takes.
Figure 3.23
After clearing the hurdle, a hurdler drives his foot towards the ground while in
flight. Then the upper body of the jumper is raised. These actions prevent the centre
of gravity from moving above or below the path that the body of the hurdler takes.
Figure 3.24
After a high jumper has taken off, he turns his body while in the air. This turning
takes place around an axis which lies through the centre of gravity of the jumper’s
body.
Figure 3.25
In discus throw, the centre of gravity of the body of the thrower has to move in a
linear path from the beginning of the circular motion till the throw in order to exert
force in the right direction.
Figure 3.26
At the beginning of this lesson we learnt how a shot putter maintains his body
balance by bringing the centre of gravity of his body down to a lower level by
directing his body forward and downwards after the shot put has been released from
his hand.
Figure 3.27
When maintaining an incorrect posture the muscles, bones and the other components
of the body will be put to extra and unnecessary effort. This increases the risk of
injuring joints, muscles, spine and getting disabilities in the long term. Therefore
always remember to maintain the centre of gravity and a good balance by adopting
correct postures.
Summary
In our daily life we adopt static and dynamic postures. Centre of gravity and
balance are two important bio mechanical principles that determine the state of the
posture. Centre of gravity is a point in which the weight of body acts while balance
is the ability to balance the body when we engage in different types of postures.
The position of centre of gravity changes according to the posture. Maintaining
the line of gravity within the supporting base, maintaining the centre of gravity at
a lower level, having a wider supporting base, keeping parts of the body moved in
opposite directions, bending the body towards the external force are some of the
important factors that will help to maintain balance. In our daily life we engage in
static postures such as standing, sitting and lying down. It is important to maintain a
correct posture in order to maintain the centre of gravity at a suitable point in order
to balance the body. Adopting wrong postures will result in many injuries to the
body and disabilities later in life.
