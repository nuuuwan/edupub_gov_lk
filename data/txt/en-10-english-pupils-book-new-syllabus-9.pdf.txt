Activity 01
Reading and Speaking
Vidath made the following speech at a meeting of the English Literary
Association meeting. Read it and discuss the questions that follow.
Good afternoon everybody! Dear teachers and friends, I’m here to speak a few
words on “Personality.”
Recently I read an article on ‘personality’ and this made me think about my
own personality. After reading it, I started wondering how my friends differ
from me. This inspired me to find more about this topic.
Just as people identify us with our name, they identify us with our qualities
and behaviours. So each person is unique. This is the result of our unique
personality. Personality can be explained based on the patterns of behaviour and
personal traits. Also these things are found to be a dynamic and an organized
set. In other words, it can tell you the type of person you are, which is shown by
the way you behave, feel and think.
From where do we get our personality? It can come to us by birth and by
the environment we live in. Hence, people are different from one another.
We come across many people in our day to day life. Among them we may find

a friend who is very much outgoing and another, a little shy. Therefore two
friends with different personalities should not mock at each other or compare
themselves but ought to understand that these differences are natural.
Although personality is different from person to person, the aspects of one’s
personality can be developed. Yet, some of the features of the basic personality
type will remain unchanged. However, we can and we ought to try to change
the aspects of our personality that we are unhappy with. Moreover, this will help
us to strengthen ourselves and become a well-rounded individual. This could
be started by the help of our school environment. That is the reason why we get
so many different kinds of activities to do at school. We need to participate in
these activities willingly to develop ourselves.
Let’s focus on building up our personality by changing some of its negative
aspects.
Thank you!

Read the following poem and answer the questions.
For free distribution HUMAN VALUES
In the speedy materialistic race,
We have forgot our grace,
We are running behind the glitters,
Due to which everyone suffers,
In going ahead with one another,
we are pushing each other,
We have no human values,
only cry and hues,
we have no heart,
only the art
to cheat and to deceive
We can`t bear,
the progress of other
we, we, and only we
