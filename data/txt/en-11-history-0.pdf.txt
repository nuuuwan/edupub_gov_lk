Industrial Revolution
Introduction
The broad change generated by man in the industrial and technological fields
within a period of about six decades by producing goods with the help of machines
instead of manual labour is termed as “the industrial revolution.”
1.1 Beginning and Development of the Industrial Revolution
The industrial revolution began towards the latter part of the 18th century in Britain.
It was limited to Britain for about another half century. Yet, by the 19th century, the
influence of the industrial revolution spread to the other countries in Europe and
the rest of the world.
Trade was the major reason for the emergence of the industrial revolution in Europe.
When the situation of Europe in the 18th century is analyzed, it can be seen that
France, Portugal and Spain other than Britain engaged themselves in colonization
and extensive trade. Therefore, it is important to inquire into the reasons why such
a revolution began in Britain.
 Reasons for the Emergence of the Industrial Revolution in Britain
Financial and commercial affairs started developing in Europe since the 16th century
and by the 18th century, Britain had surpassed some of the other leading European
countries such as Holland, France, Portugal and Spain. As a result a wealthy class
who could invest money on industries was created in that country. At the same
time, there was a rapid growth in the population of Britain which resulted in a high
demand for goods and in turn producing goods to meet the increasing demand
became a challenge. This led to a development in the industrial sector. Further, there
was an expansion of the knowledge of science as a result of the Renaissance that took
place in Europe in 14th and 15th centuries. This knowledge was used in producing
- 1 -
new machinery. Minerals such as iron and steel that were necessary in producing
machinery too were found in Britain. Not only that Britain easily found things like
coal which played a major role in producing energy.
Though there was a heavy population in contemporary kingdoms such as France,
the development of trade in those countries was limited in comparison to Britain.
But, Britain had obstructed the commercial relationships of its colonies with other
countries in the world by imposing several commercial laws. Thus, Britain was
able to maintain a high demand for their productions in its own colonies because
they had no other choice than importing those productions from Britain. Some of
those products with high demand in Britain were suitable for the production using
machines. One example is the high demand placed upon British cotton clothes
by India. Though there was an increasing demand for British cotton clothes, they
did not have the ability to increase the production within a short period with the
existing production methods. Because of the high demand that existed for the British
productions, there arose a need in increasing the production in a short period. It is
as a solution to this challenge that there was a rapid development in the industrial
field.
There were several changes in the agriculture field too in contemporary Britain.
There, the rich landowners combined small pieces of land that belonged to poor
farmers and made large farms. This is termed as the “encroaching movement.” As
a result of this, the farmers who lost their land migrated to cities in search of jobs.
The extra labour that was generated as a result was able to be used for the industrial
development.
Unlike in other countries, in Britain talented individuals had the opportunity to earn
money irrespective of their social status. This free social environment in the attitudes
supported the spread of novel ideas and it was conducive for the development of
the industrial sector. Further, together with the development of the economy, the
emergence of new banks and financial organizations that provided capital for the
industries and businesses was seen.
The political stability that was prevailing in Britain too helped the industrial
revolution. The parliament provided the freedom, tax relief and support to engage
in business activities for the economic development.
Compared with the other countries in Europe, Britain had the most conducive
environment for the industrial revolution. A number of features such as being a
small island, ability to build a web of markets throughout the country, ability to
- 2 -
charge high prices for productions and London city being a centre that distributed
raw materials, capital and products; helped Britain to surpass other countries in the
industrial production field.
1.2. Rise of the Industrial Revolution
The industrial revolution in Britain was based on three industries as given below.
 Textile industry
 Iron and steel industry
 Coal industry
The development that occurred in these fields resulted in the gradual progress in
other fields such as transport, communication and agriculture.
Textile Industry
Textile producers in Britain faced a challenge of increasing their textile products to meet
the high demand that came from their own colonies. Weaving clothes became a little faster
with the invention of the flying shuttle by John K. in 1733. But the slowness in preparing
threads needed in weaving clothes still remained a problem. According to the situation that
was there at that time, threads produced
by six thread makers per day were
enough only for one weaver to work for
one day. Therefore, there was some idea
of increasing the pace of spinning. As a
result of that enthusiasm, a person called
James Hargreaves produced a machine
called ‘Jenny’ in 1764 for cotton weaving.
This machine was a manually operated
one. Later in 1769, Richard Arkwright
produced a more efficient, water powered
spinning wheel. It was named as ‘water
turbine’. Arkwright’s creation was an
important production when compared
to the other machines used for the same
purpose in the past. But it was difficult to be used in houses because it was very big in size.
On the other hand, because a fast tide of water was needed to run the machine, it could be
used only in such places where there was a continuous supply of water.
Fig 1.1 – The Jenny machine produced by James
Hargreaves for spinning cotton in 1764
- 3 -
Samuel Crompton who used the
functioning principles of Spinning
Jenny and
the Water Turbine
produced a new machine called
“Mule” around 1779. This helped
to produce finer and stronger
threads. Then around 1785, Edmund
Cartwright found a way of running
the ‘Mule’ by steam power. Thus,
within a period of about 30 years
new machines and novel technical
methods were invented to make
spinning cotton more efficient.
Hence, there was a big revolution in
the weaving industry during a short
period of time.

2. Explain the industrial development in textile sector under the following
areas.

Iron and Steel Industry
Ore deposits are found in abundance in Britain. British people produced iron and
steel even before the industrial revolution to make weapons, agricultural equipment
and household tools. They used firewood to smelt ore for this purpose. It was difficult
to meet the huge demand for iron and steel needed for the production of machinery
that emerged as a result of the industrial revolution using firewood.
Hence, alternative methods had to be looked for. In 1730 the method of smelting
ore using coal was found by Abraham Darby. They produced molded iron in this
method. In 1784 tempered iron could be produced with the invention of 'Roller'
machine by Henri Cort. Henri Bessemer found a new method to produce steel by
removing dirt from iron in 1856. The invention of open oven method in 1860, by
developing the above mentioned method, enabled the production of high quality
steel. Steel could be produced cheaply and
quickly in this method. Making an electric
oven to smelt ore by Wilhelm Siemens in
1870 helped the improvement of iron and
steel industry. These mew creations paved
the way for a rapid improvement in iron
and steel industry.

Coal Industry
There are so many coal mines in Britain. South Wales, Yorkshire, Lancashire are
some places where coal mines are situated. Coal was popular as a cheap and efficient
fuel for smelting ore, running machines and household chores. Though the demand
for coal increased with the industrial development, mining coal was difficult.
Several new inventions were made in order to find solutions to the problems such
as removing the water that gathered in the mine when it was dug deep, poisonous
gases found in the depth, increasing heat and providing light to the depth.
Thomas Newcomen invented a steam engine in 1735 to pump water of the mines
and artificially cool the air. Yet, it was inefficient and could not be used in other
industries too. Therefore, James Watt developed this to a new steam engine in 1736.
It was an efficient engine that could be used in many industries.

The problem of providing light to the mines too was solved when Humphry Davy
produced the safety lamp in 1812. In 1839, a method was found to take coal out of
the mines using iron cables instead of the old method of taking them out by women
and children using copper cables.
The development of the coal industry resulted in several by products. Tar obtained
by burning coal was used in road construction. Paints that were necessary in dyeing
clothes too were made with the help of coal. It was further used to produce medicine,
perfumes, oil and fertilizers.

Expansion of the Industrial Revolution
The industrial revolution that took place in the fields of textile, coal and iron
industries in Britain soon spread into the other fields also. When the nature of this
expansion is considered, two types of expansions can be identified as expansion of
industrial revolution to other fields and expansion of industrial revolution to other
countries.
1. Expansion to other fields
The new knowledge that emerged in relation to industrial and technological fields as
a result of industrial revolution did not limit itself to industries and productions. It
spread to the other fields too. Fields like transport, communication and agriculture
too had rapid development under the influence of the industrial revolution.
 Expansion of transportation
Many changes took place in the transport sector because of the influence of the
industrial revolution. With the development of the industrial sector, a necessity
of developing a road system arose for transporting raw materials to factories and
transporting products to markets. Therefore in 1811, John McAdam introduced a
new way of making roads. It is called “the Macadam Method.”

Even the vehicles that carry heavy loads of goods and passengers could be driven
fast and easily on these roads. Therefore, hundreds of miles of such roads were built
in Britain and Scotland within a short period.
Machines and engines used for transport too developed with the development of
roads. The production of the steam engine by George Stephenson in 1814 became a
landmark in the industrial revolution. As a result, trains could be used to transport
coal and other products. The time spent for transport could be minimized by
transporting products from factories to markets and transportation cost was
reduced by being able to transport heavy loads of goods at a time. It is believed that
George Stephenson who invented the locomotive engine was not able to read and
write till he was 17 years old.

Fig 1.9 The steam engine invented by George
Stephenson
The development that took place in land transport as a result of the industrial
revolution, affected the naval and water transport too.
- 8 -
In 1807, an American called Robert Fulton produced the steamboat. Henry Bell
produced the steam ship in 1811 for passenger transport. It used firewood as fuel at
the beginning and later coal. The production of motor car in 1885 by the German,
Daimler and the production of the aeroplane by Wright brothers in 1903, made
a huge change in the transport system. Thus, as a result of the expansion of the
industrial revolution, there was a rapid change in all forms of transport; land, water
and air transport.

Fig 1.11 Aeroplane produced by
Wright brothers
 Expansion of Communication Sector
There was a rapid development in communication sector too in parallel to the
development in transport. The postal service that existed in Britain up to this was
very costly. A need arose to exchange letters quickly for a cheaper price in a shorter
time for business activities.
Fig 1.12 – Several experiments to develop communication between two distanced
places using electronic methods were conducted from the beginning of the 19th
century. As a result of this, an apparatus was produced to communicate using
human voice, between two places through cables in 1876. It is called the ‘telephone’.
It was produced by Alexander Graham Bell.
- 9 -
A new postal service which was called ‘Penny Postal Service’ was started for this in
1840. A letter could be sent to any corner of the country by spending just a penny
(pence) through this.
There arose another need for sending messages between two places more quickly
than sending letters with the rapid development of industrial and transport sector.
As a result of the experiments conducted for this, Samuel Morse was able to start
telegraph service in 1844. Sending messages between two places through a cable
was started in this method using symbols.
An immense change took place in the communication sector in 1895 when
Guglielmo Marconi invented the method of sending messages through radio signals
and then John Logie Baird invented the television. These two inventions supported
not only the development of communication but also the development of trade and
commerce including other economic activities.

the television he invented

 Expansion of Agriculture
There was a rapid development in agriculture in parallel to the industrial revolution.
Several factors that affected this can be identified as;
 Beginning of mega farms
 Changing of crops
 Using new technology in animal husbandry
 Using new agricultural methods and equipment
- 10 -
The establishment of factories expanded with the industrialization attracting more
people to cities. This left their land in villages uncultivated. The rest of the minor
proprietors had to give up their lands due to various reasons. Such small lands
given up thus and the lands taken over from other farmers were combined together
to make mega farms. Agriculture developed as a result of cultivating these lands
which came under the encroaching movement.

to reduce the number of seeds
needed for sowing and increase
productivity.
Fig 1.15 Cultivation using change of crops
At the same time, animal products increased due to the new technological methods
used in animal husbandry. One example is the findings regarding breeding of sheep
made by Robert Bakewell.
The invention of efficient equipment that came with the industrial revolution
altered the field of agriculture completely. Machines were produced to clear forests,
prepare the land and produce seeds. Further, paying attention on producing manure
to achieve more productivity in agriculture is an important move. As a result of
experiments done in this field, a type of manure called ‘Guano Fertilizers’ was
produced in Africa for the first time in 1800. Then it was produced in America also.
After some time chemical fertilizers and agro chemicals were produced.
Agricultural and animal products could be sold at a cheaper price because they
could be produced with less expenditure owing to the store facilities and modern
transport methods that came as a result of the industrial revolution. As a result,
there was a high demand for agro products.

2. Expansion to other countries
Results of the Industrial Revolution
The industrial revolution that began in Britain spread to the countries in the
European continent also within a short period of time. Later it went to Asian,
American and African continents also. There were several reasons for the spread of
the industrial revolution to other countries in the 19th century.
• Increase in demand for goods that came as a result of rapid increase in world
population
• Development of travel and transport in Europe
• Discovery of coal in France and Germany
As a result, other countries in the world too started to speed up their production
using machines in the same way England did. Industrial centres emerged in areas
that were situated close to markets and where raw materials were found in abundance
in Germany and France. Germany that was able to mark an increased industrial
development, had become a powerful country at the beginning of World War I.
Then the industrial revolution spread to other European countries like France,
Belgium, Austria, Hungary and Prussia. The Austrian empire built roads to a length
of 30000 miles and Belgium doubled the length of its roads at the same time. Then,
every country started laying railways. The effects of the industrial revolution were
felt in states in America that existed as colonies of Britain as well. There was a rapid
industrial development after independence in that country.
Japan was an Asian country which had an enormous development in the industrial
sector during the latter half of the 19th century and the first few decades of the 20th
century. Japan has become a country that holds a competitive place among the
countries that have obtained a rapid development in science and technological fields
by following the western methods and models.
The influence of the industrial revolution was greatly felt in many Asian countries
including China, India and Sri Lanka by the 20th century. Thus the world became a
global village because of the industrial revolution that spread to the other countries
in the world and the rapid development it created in transport and communication
fields.
Broad changes occurred in political, social and economic sectors in many countries
due to the industrial revolution that took place everywhere in the world. These
results had both good and bad characteristics.
 Changes in the Political Field
The industrial revolution resulted in a wealthy class that invested money for profit
and an underprivileged class that survived by selling labour. The rich exploited the
labour of the underprivileged in their businesses and earned a huge profit. Yet the
living conditions of the labourers who worked in factories were very poor. Because
of this suppression there were many clashes between the rich and the poor including
the emergence of labour unions, boycotts, struggles for rights, etc. This situation
ended in the expansion of political beliefs such as socialism and liberalism.
Fig 1.16 - A struggle for rights by labourers
Adam Smith presented the concept called “laissez-faire” which led to the expansion
of capitalism throughout the world. Laissez-faire means reducing the government
involvement and giving more allowance for private sector involvement in the
economic matters. At the same time, as the industrialization spread throughout
Europe, there arose a need for getting raw materials for a cheaper price and selling
the products at a higher prices. Therefore, the European countries had to compete

Europe, there arose a need for getting raw materials for a cheaper price and selling
the products at a higher prices. Therefore, the European countries had to compete
- 13 -
for tightening their political grasp in the colonies. This new imperialism which
came after 1850 is called neo-imperialism. This struggle of European countries to
capture new colonies became a major factor that led to World War I.
 Changes in the Economic Sector
One change that took place in the industrial revolution is the expansion of
industrial products and commercial activities taking the first place in the economy.
Accordingly, a wealthy class that owned factories and a class of business people
gradually developed. Farmers who owned small lands had to come to cities and join
these factories as they could not carry on working in their farms. Because of that, the
self-sufficient economy failed and emerged a working class that worked for a salary.
Thus, the agro-economic system broke down and the import-export economy came
forward. Agricultural production too became industrialized and a number of food
types came to markets. As a result, both local and foreign businessess developed in
European countries and Asian, African and Latin American countries which were
the colonies of European countries. In the same way, the capitalist economic system
too spread rapidly around the globe.
Private entrepreneurs could not afford to invest money on these expanded businesses
individually. So, several entrepreneurs got together and formed combined business
companies. These companies expanded their commercial activities into Asian,
African and Latin American countries with the help of their governments to achieve
their targets.
At first, these trade companies consisted of local businessmen only. Yet, towards the
first part of the 19th century, these companies became multi-national companies.
These companies that were engaged in production of goods and buying and selling
simultaneously were engaged in monetary and banking activities. This made
transactions and loan facilities easy for the entrepreneurs.
 Impact on the Society
The society was influenced both positively and negatively due to the industrial
revolution. Many new cities were created as a result of the industrialization and
the lives of people who lived there were greatly affected. People could afford to buy
those items that were produced in bulk in the factories. At the same time these
factories generated a lot of new job opportunities. As a result people could enjoy
better living conditions.
- 14 -
The number of cities and the
size of cities in Europe increased
very fast as a result of the
industrialization. The
outcome of them was that they
became unbearably populated.
Yet, the development of basic
facilities of these cities came
about very slowly. For an example,
though in Vienna, within 20
years before 1847 the population
increase is 20%, building houses
increased in 11.5% only.
In many countries of the world
new cities emerged as a result of
the industrialization and villagers
began to migrate to these cities. The increasing number of job opportunities in cities
that emerged due to mega industries sped up the urbanization.
Fig 1.17 – Child labourers who worked in
factories during the industrial revolution
One major social outcome of the industrialization is the formation of a classed
society. By the 20th century economic activities of all European countries were
governed by the class of rich factory owners. This rich class consisted of two major
fractions.
• Aristocrats who owned lands
• The other class consisted of middle class business owners, small scale traders,
factory owners, bankers, contractors, engineers and lawyers, etc.
They employed labourers for less wages and earned heavy profit through that. People
in the rich class developed comparatively better living conditions and spent more
comfortable and enjoyable lives.
But, the living conditions of the working class people were in a very poor state.
The husband and wife both in the same family had to work in order to survive
and sometimes they had to send their children too to work. They had to suffer a
- 15 -
lot in these factories working for 12 -14 hours and the jobs they had to do were
really tormenting. Women and children had to work in factories where there
were no facilities and protection. Labourers had to reside close to the factories in
industrialized cities. They had to live in shanties or lined houses which did not have
minimum sanitary facilities. All members of the family had to live in one room.
Thus, what the underprivileged class which was the majority of the society received
were unfavourable living conditions, poverty and a meagre salary. Under these
adverse circumstances drunkenness and other abuses were inevitable.
Many countries paid their attention to resolving these social disparities by 18th
and 19th centuries. At the same time labourers came together as unions and started
struggling to get their salary increased, the number of working hours reduced and
sanitary and other facilities increased. Therefore, every government had to impose
laws for the social and economic welfare of the working class.
Fig 1.18 A factory emitting poisonous gases to the environment
Another bad effect of the industrial revolution is the environmental pollution. Water
sources got contaminated due to the addition of waste materials to water sources by
factories and the fumes released by factories became harmful for the health of the
people. Further, the accumulation of poisonous gases in the atmosphere threatened
the existence of human beings.

1.3. Effects of the Industrial Revolution on Sri Lanka
How the industrial revolution that started in Britain spread throughout the world
within a short time has been explained above. Although the industrialization that
took place in Britain and other European countries did not take place in Sri Lanka
in the 19th century, the effects of the industrial revolution could be identified from
Sri Lanka too. The major reason for that is, Sri Lanka being a colony of Britain
when industrial revolution started. British people came to Sri Lanka and started
mega scale cultivations. Many factories were started in connection to thus started
cultivations such as tea, coconut, rubber and machines were imported from Britain
to be used in those factories.
Important incidents of this period:
• Starting of a mill to pound coffee by the governor, Fredric North in 1804 AD
• Using machines for activities of tea factories such as drying, grading and exporting
• Using machines to prepare rubber for exporting
• Introduction of Macadam method to build roads in 1885
There was a need for manpower for the estates and factories and the labour class
was formed by the people who worked there for salary. Landowners and factory
owners became the affluent class and they organized themselves separately as a
wealthy, educated middle class. The capitalist economic system grew in Sri Lanka
and import and export trade held a prominent place. The necessity of a banking
system was felt in order to handle financial transactions between countries in import
and export. So, banks were started in Sri Lanka.

The transport system had to be developed in order to carry the estate products to
trade centres and the harbour in Colombo and supply necessities to estates. Up to
this time transportation was done by means of carts. Because it was not so efficient,
roads and railways were introduced. The Colombo - Kandy road was constructed
during the time of the governor, Edward Barns. Thereafter, roads to Kandy were built
from Kurunegala and Dambulla. After that, the system of constructing roads using
stones and tar was started. Further, the wood bridges that existed over water ways
were replaced by iron bridges. The governor, Henry Ward started laying railways.
The construction of the Kandy railway was started in 1858 and was completed in
1863. In August 1867, a train service was started from Colombo to Kandy for the
first time. After that it was extended from Peradeniya to Nawalapitiya in 1871 and
up to Bandarawela in 1899.
With the development of roads and transportation, trade centres were started and
they expanded to cities. Gampola, Badulla, Ratnapura and Matale are such cities
beyond Colombo that were populated during this time. Sending messages was done
through a messenger up to this time. An official postal system had been started
by 1815 connecting the cities like Colombo, Trincomalee, Galle, Kandy and Jaffna.
This was carried out using chariots. Thus, running chariots was started for the first
time in Asia, in Sri Lanka. The Sri Lanka’s first postal stamp was issued in 1857. By
1903, 340 post offices had been opened around the country. The telegram service
was started in 1858.

Establishment of British
Power in Sri Lanka
Introduction
You studied in grade 10, how the Portuguese came to Asia and how the Portuguese
and the Dutch people occupied the coastal region of Sri Lanka. After those two
nations, the next European nation that imposed its power on Sri Lanka was the
British. They who spoke English language were called the English. This lesson
explains how the English established their power in Sri Lanka and the struggles
that arose against them in the first half of the 19th century.
2.1 Arrival of British in Asia
The English who noticed that the Portuguese and the Dutch people were earning a
lot of profit from the trade activities in Asia, also paid their attention to Asia. As a
result, a group of English businessmen established the East India Trade Company
in December 1600, by a royal warrant obtained from Queen Elizabeth I to do trade
activities in Asia. The first fleet of ships of this company had gone to Sumatra islands
and started trade. Then, another fleet of ships came to India under William Hokins
and conducted discussions about trade with the Mughal emperor, Jahangir.
At the beginning of their visits to Asia, the English tried to tighten their trade
relations with Southeast Asian region.
There had been fights between the Portuguese and the Dutch to claim the trade
power in Southeast Asia during the first two decades of the 17th century. At
certain occasions, the English have given their assistance to the Dutch against the
Portuguese. The Dutch never expected to see the English developing a power in
Southeast Asian islands where spices grew well, although they obtained the help
of the English to fight their common enemy, the Portuguese. Because of this, in
1623, the Dutch attacked a fortress in a spices island, Ambon and killed a group
of English people living there. As the English did not have sufficient power in the
region to retaliate the Dutch attack, they withdrew themselves from the southeast
asian region. It seems that they completely focused their attention on India after
that.
- 19 -
It took more than 10 years for the English to establish trade relations with India
though they tried it since 1607. As the English worked very tactfully in India, they
were able to start trade centres in several areas such as Bombay, Calcutta and Madras
by the latter part of the 17th century. Yet, the English had to compete with the
French other than the Dutch to protect their trade because from 1664, the French
also came to India and established trade centres in places like Pondicherry, Karikal
and Chadranagar. A political battle began between the British and the French by
the 18th century to establish their power in India.
2.2 The British focusing their Attention on Sri Lanka
The English did not pay any attention to Sri Lanka for about a century after they
came to India. The reasons for this are that the English had not yet firmly established
their power in India and the Dutch had a strong fort system in the coastal line of
the island followed by the Portuguese. The English began to pay more attention to
Sri Lanka when they who were satisfied so far with trade power, started exercising
political power on India in the first half of the 18th century because the Mughal
empire in India started to decline. There were two major reasons for that special
attention.
1. The location of Sri Lanka
2. Getting valuable trade items such as cinnamon from Sri Lanka
The English felt the importance of Sri Lanka owing to two reasons. They were; the
location of Sri Lanka close to India and Sri Lanka being an excellent centre for
the administration of naval and trade activities in the maritime zone around India
including the Bay of Bengal. The English strongly felt the necessity of a harbour to
repair the ships damaged due to enemy attacks in the fights between the British
and the French around the Bay of Bengal. The English had a special interest in the
Trincomalee harbour. Some reasons that made the English to pay attention to the
Trincomalee harbour are given below.
 The location of Sri Lanka facing the Bay of Bengal
 It was important for the British to protect the naval power in the eastern coast of
India
 The ability to use Tricomalee harbour to protect ships from monsoon winds that
come from Northeastern region
Trincomalee harbour
Map 2.1 – Location of Sri Lanka and the Trincomalee harbour
The English knew that if the Trincomalee harbour which was an excellent centre
for the security of India and for regulating the naval activities in the Indian Ocean
fell into the hands of the French it would be a great loss for them. Hence, the
importance of the geographical location of Sri Lanka and the great importance of
the Trincomalee harbour became the major reasons to draw the attention of the
English to Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka was a famous country for spices like cinnamon even by that time. The
English knew that Sri Lanka produced high quality cinnamon which had a good
demand in the European market and the Dutch earned a great profit by selling
cinnamon. Therefore, the English wanted to take the sole authority of selling
cinnamon into their hands. Other than cinnamon; pepper, cardamom, cloves, pearls,
gems and ivory were some other items that had a good market. The English wanted
to establish the political power in this country because of the above mentioned
reasons.

 Diplomatic Relationships between the English and the Kandyan Kingdom
In the same way that they sought the assistance of the Dutch to chase the Portuguese
away from Sri Lanka, the Sri Lankan kings thought of seeking the assistance of some
other nation to drive away the Dutch too. Therefore, King Keerthi Sri Rajasinghe
sent messengers to both the English who were in India and the French. That paved
the way for the English messengers to reach the kingdom of Kandy. Three English
messengers had visited the Kandyan kingdom several times before they captured
the hill country.
 In 1762, John Pybus came to the hill country
 In 1782, Hugh Boyd came to the hill country
 In 1795, Robert Andrews came to the hill country
King Keerthi Sri Rajasinghe was the ruler of the upcountry when John Pybus came
there. The other two messengers came during the reign of King Rajadhirajasinghe.
The English intended to establish trade relationships with Sri Lanka through the visits
of John Pybus and Hugh Boyd. The English and the Dutch stopped their fighting
during these visits and used the Trincomalee harbour in mutual understanding
when it was needed. As a result the English were reluctant to help the king against
the Dutch. The kings of the hill country were not interested in creating bonds with
a nation that was not ready to help them defeat the Dutch. Therefore, the first two
diplomatic visits were not successful.
After the English navy captured the Trincomalee harbour which was in the hands
of the Dutch, in 1795, Robert Andrews visited the hill country and met King
Rajadhirajasinghe. The purpose of his visit was to discuss with the king how they
could get the assistance of the kingdom of Kandy in the fights to conquer the areas
governed by the Dutch. The king agreed to support the English forces. Yet, the
English, after capturing the Dutch fortresses, understood that the battle against the
Dutch was not as hard as they anticipated. Therefore, the English did not like to
share with the Sinhala kings, the profits they would receive by capturing the Dutch
held areas. As a result, the English did not wish to agree to the conditions of the king
and establish long lasting relationships with the king of the hill country.

2.3. Establishment of British Power
Three distinguished stages can be seen in the colonization of Sri Lanka by the British.
 The English East India Trade Company capturing the coastal areas of the island
in 1796.
 Turning the coastal areas governed under the East India Trade Company into a
colony of the British crown.
 Capturing the hill country by the British in 1815.
 Establishment of British Power in the Coastal Areas of Sri Lanka
The new political situation that emerged in Europe after the French revolution in
1789, affected the colonization in Asia by the Europeans. The army of the newly
formed French government after the French revolution invaded Holland in 1794.
King William V who was the Stadtholder of Holland escaped to Britain. Holland,
the country of the Dutch fell into the hands of the French. As a result there was
the danger of the Sri Lankan coastal areas governed by the Dutch, falling into the
hands of the French. The English, who very well knew the value of Sri Lanka, used
this opportunity to capture Sri Lanka. The English made the Stadtholder of Holland
who was seeking refuge in Britain due to the French attack, send a letter to their
advantage to the Dutch governor of Sri Lanka.
- 23 -
Because the Stadtholder sent the letter from the Kew
palace of Britain, it is known as the Kew letter. The
letter said that the English troops should be allowed
into the Dutch held areas of Sri Lanka in order to
prevent them from falling into the hands of the French.
The Dutch governor of the island, Funn Englebeck
received the letter in February 1795. Yet, he was
reluctant to let the English troops into his fortresses.
Because of that the English attacked the Dutch held
Trincomalee in 1795. The Dutch surrendered to the
English with no conditions.
Fig 2.1 – The Dutch stadtholder , William V
Fig 2.2 – The Kew Palace in England
After Trincomalee fell into the hands of the British many other fortresses such as;
Batticaloa, Mullathivu, Point Pedro, Jaffna, Mannar soon surrendered to the English.
Because both Colombo and Galle surrendered to the English, all areas that were
under the Dutch fell into the hands of the English. A treaty was signed between the
Dutch and the English, allowing the Dutch to leave the country peacefully, avoiding
a further loss for them. This was signed on February 16th. With that the coastal areas
which were in the hands of the Dutch fell into the hands of the English.
 Governance of the Coastal Areas under the East Indian Trade Company
When the Portuguese and the Dutch ruled the coastal belt of Sri Lanka, they had
organized the administration well using native officers as much as possible. Yet,
the English Trade Company did not understand this. Therefore the English hired
- 24 -
officers from the Madras government and governed the parts they captured under
Madras rulers. This lasted from 1796 to 1798.
A Resident was appointed to Sri Lanka under the Madras administration to rule the
coastal areas of Sri Lanka. A group of assistant supervisors was appointed under the
Resident to collect income and they were named as collectors. Their service centre
was named as Kachcheri. That was how the Kachcheri system was started in Sri
Lanka. Another group of officers was appointed in assistance to the collectors who
were called as Avumildars. More officers were there to help the Avumildars and all
these groups were engaged in collecting income under the supervision of collectors.
The local officers like Mudliers were ignored in the English administration. People
were brought from Madras for the above posts and those who came from Madras
did not have any knowledge about the local languages, culture and traditions. The
relationship between the general public and the administrative officers became
distanced because such a group of officers was appointed for the civil administration,
legal system and income collection.
The India Trade Company had spent a lot of money in capturing the coastal belt of
Sri Lanka. Another significant feature of the British administration is their attempts
to cover the above mentioned cost and to achieve fast profits. They imposed several
new taxes in the coastal areas to meet the above target. People in the coastal areas
were in trouble when they had to pay those taxes in cash. One such example is the
newly introduced ‘tax on coconut trees.’ Thus, someone who owned more than 10
coconut trees had to pay a tax of one silver panam (six cents) for each coconut tree.
People were irritated because the tax was charged without considering the nature of
the harvest and they had to pay it in cash. This soon became an insurgency due to
the repugnance of the general public towards the new administration. This rebellion
that began in 1797 against the India Trade Company extended to all coastal areas
quickly. This was suppressed after much effort by the British. This insurgency gave
evidence to the fact that there was much resistance to the English administration
at its very beginning. Therefore, a commission was appointed to look into the
situation of the coastal areas and suggest changes. This commission was named as
Meuron commission after the name of Brigadier General De Meuron who headed
the commission.
Some proposals of the Meuron Commission;

- 25 -
Removal of new taxes including the tax on coconut trees.
Appointing officers for legal affairs and income collection separately.
Re-establishment of the Dutch court system.
A change occurred in the English administration of the coastal areas of this country
since October, 1798. Thus, the British government appointed a governor for the
administrative and political affairs. That is how the governor, Fredric North came to
Sri Lanka. Still, it was the Trade Company that was in charge of collecting income
to cover up the expenditure incurred by the English Trade Company, in capturing
the coastal areas of Sri Lanka. The governor is responsible for the British crown and
should follow the instructions of the board of directors of the Trade company.
This system of administration was known as ‘dual administration.’ This system
continued from 1798 to 1802. The officers of the Trade Company in Sri Lanka
did not give enough support to the governor, North. Due to such failures in the
dual administration system, it was discontinued in 1802 and the coastal regions
of Sri Lanka were declared a colony of the British crown. After that all parts that
belonged to the British were directly governed by the British government.

There were two Nayakkar princes who were heirs to the throne by the time
King Rajadhirajasinghe died in 1798. One was Kannasami and the other was
Muththusami. According to a plan of Pilimathalawe who was the ‘Maha Adikaram’
of the hill country kingdom, prince Kannasami was coronated as ‘Sri Wickrama
Rajasinghe.’ Then, prince Muththusami escaped to the English for protection.
Rajasinghe
Fig 2.4 – King Sri Wickrama
The British, soon after establishing their power
in the coastal regions of the country, eyed on
the hill country kingdom also. The policy of the
governor, Fredric North is very significant here.
He tried to get the consent of the hill country
king to a treaty which was more advantageous
to the British. He sent envoys to the hill country
headed by Commander MacDowell in 1800. He
strengthened the convoy with 1164 soldiers and 8
cannons in order to display their military power
and get the king’s consent to a treaty which was
more beneficial for them. Yet, King Sri Wickrama
Rajasinghe denied the permission of allowing
such a massive army and cannons entering the
upcountry. As a result the envoys had to enter the
kingdom alone leaving the soldiers and cannons
outside the upcountry. Though MacDowell had discussions with the king and the
other aristocrats, the king did not agree to the conditions of the British. So, this
mission became a complete failure.
North was distressed because he could not get the sanction of the king. He considered
the independent government of the upcountry as a threat to their power in the
coastal regions. Because the British had to employ a massive army for the security
of the coastal areas and the protection of the inland territories, they were forced
to bear a huge cost. Another problem they faced was that the general public of the
coastal areas still accepted the upcountry king as their king too and when there
were insurgencies the upcountry king helped the rebels. The British further knew
that if the upcountry king happened to request the support of the French who were
the enemies of the British, that would be an added threat to their administration.
On the other hand, the English wanted to have contact with Trincomalee which
was their main naval centre from the administration centre of Colombo via land.
They had to cross the territories of the upcountry in order to keep contact between
Colombo and Trincomalee. The English wanted to build a road between these
two cities. Owing to the above reasons, the British paid their attention to either
conquering the upcountry or winning their good will.
- 27 -
 Invasion of the Hill Country in 1803
When MacDowell’s mission failed to give the expected results, the governor, North
decided to invade the hill country. So, North sent two troops of soldiers to the
hill country from Trincomalee and Colombo in January and February, 1803. In
this invasion, which was headed by MacDowell, the British troops entered the hill
country on 21st of February. King Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe and the citizens vacated
the city as a security measure and started organizing themselves. The British
named prince Muttusami who had been brought to the upcountry with them as the
king. But, the people of upcountry started to get together with king Sri Wickrama
Rajasinghe and prepared for the war ignoring Muttusami.
The British had to face unexpected difficulties with the beginning of the rainy season
because epidemics started spreading among the British troops. At the same time, as
a result of the upcountry people blocking all supply means, the English suffered due
to lack of food and difficulty of communication with Colombo. The English troops
suffered heavy losses under the timely attacks of the upcountry people. Happening
to let their puppet ruler, prince Muttusami to be captured by the upcountry people,
provides evidence to the seriousness of the defeat the British experienced.
Before this attack, the governor North did not have a clear understanding about
the hill country. Yet, when his invasion ended in defeat, he understood that the
upcountry kingdom is strong and it cannot be overpowered by such attacks. Hence,
the British moved into a highly tactful policy regarding the hill country after the
invasion of 1803.
 Invasion of the Hill Country in 1815
Thomas Maitland was appointed the governor of Sri Lanka at the end of the
governor North’s session of duty in 1805. Unlike North, he did not hasten to invade
the hill country; instead moved into a strategic policy and started carefully laying
the platform for a future invasion. He employed an efficient civil servant named
John D'Oyly for this.
 John D'Oyly
John D'Oyly was a graduate of the Cambridge University. He tried to understand
the local culture after coming to Sri Lanka unlike the others who looked down upon
it. He engaged himself in studies under the Buddhist monks like Rev. Korathota
- 28 -
Dhammarama and Rev. Morathota Dhammakkandha. The folklore says that D'Oyly
was capable of composing poems in contest to Gajaman Nona. D'Oyly who had an
excellent knowledge about local customs was in the habit of chewing betel also. As
a result he was capable of winning the hearts of not only the general public but also
the aristocrats of the hill country. D'Oyly completed his duty successfully using his
sharp intelligence and talents.
Fig 2.5 – John D'Oyly with the hill country aristocrats
John D'Oyly worked hard to cultivate secret connections with the upcountry
aristocrats and tried to win them towards the English people. Further, he took steps
to send spies in the disguise of sellers and palm readers and got them to gather all
information about the internal affairs of the kingdom. As a result he was able to
find out information about the internal security of the hill country, which all other
Europeans were ignorant of. It was Robert Brownrigg that became the governor
of Sri Lanka after Maitland who took the advantage of the conditions created by
Maitland and D'Oyly and took further steps to capture the hill country.
It was not only the strategies of the British that paved the way to the falling of
the hill country to the hands of the British. A number of other situations that
accelerated the downfall of the hill country had been created during the reign of
King Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe. The king who was very young and inexperienced
seemed to have taken decisions following the advice of his Nayakkar relations. The
last two Maha Adhikarams of the hill country had had disagreements with the
king. Pilimathalawwe Maha Adhikaram who worked to offer the throne to the king
too was sentenced to death by the king as a result of the problems they had with
each other. There were incongruities between Ehalepola Adhikaram who was the
successor of Pilimathalawwe Maha Adhikaram and the king.
During the reign of King Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe, disparities among the aristocrats
increased. As a result, the majority of the aristocrats worked against the king. They
- 29 -
were the group that acted as the leaders in organizing the general public to protect
the king and the kingdom during the early invasions of the Europeans.
The relationship between the king and the monks had also been broken because
several monks had been killed during that time. The bond between the king and the
people had also been broken due to some decisions the king made during the last
few years of his reign. The king prohibited staying in the city at night for the people
who had come from regions like Sabaragamuwa, Sath Korala and Sathara Korala
for the services like extending the Bogambara tank, building the ‘Paththirippu’
(the octagon) and renovations of the Kandy city. Therefore, they faced a number of
difficulties.
Though the rebellion against the king that arose in Sabaragamuwa could have been,
easily suppressed more than 100 individuals were killed in it. History says that the
king ordered to brutally massacre the wife and the children of Ehalepola because he
could not be arrested after the rebellion. These inhuman acts of the king had created
a wide gap between the king and the people of the country by 1815.
Whenever the Europeans invaded the upcountry, the aristocrats and the general
public sacrificed their lives to protect the king. The same human shield that guarded
the upcountry kingdom turned against the king because of his own deeds. As a
result the king was at danger in his own kingdom and this became an advantage to
the British. The governor, Brownrigg took advantage of this situation and when he
invaded the upcountry in January 1815, people did not come forward to protect the
king. The governor had spread messages among the upcountry people saying that
their real enemy was not the British people but the king himself and the invasion is
really for the sake of the upcountry people.
King Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe gave up the Kandy city and escaped to a secure
place as the British invaded the upcountry. The upcountry people themselves
surrounded the place where the king was hiding which was in ‘Medamahanuwara.’
They captured the king and the queens and handed them over to the British on
the 18th of February, 1815. The British were able to record a victory that any other
European nation could not record in the hill country with this arrest of the king.
But, the British did not think that they captured the whole upcountry just because
they caught the king. They could arrest the king because they were supported by the
aristocrats. Therefore, the British took steps to sign a treaty with the aristocrats and
complete the process of capturing the whole of the upcountry.

 Upcountry Treaty – 1815
On the 2nd of March, 1815 a treaty was signed between the aristocrats representing
the upcountry people and the governor, Brownrigg representing the British
government at the royal courts (Magul Maduwa), about the yielding of upcountry
kingdom. This is known as the upcountry treaty.

The upcountry treaty is an important historical document that officially accepted
the surrendering of the upcountry kingdom to the British. From the first three
statements of the treaty King Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe and his relations were
stripped off of their rights to the upcountry kingdom. The fourth statement declared
that the upcountry kingdom surrendered to the English government and further
informed that they would govern the country in such a way that the rights and
privileges of the traditional aristocrats of the upcountry are protected. The fifth
statement promised the continuation of Buddhism and Devagam and the protection
of monks, temples and devalas. The other statements explained how they expected
to conduct the judiciary system of the upcountry.
With this treaty Sri Lanka completely lost its sovereignty which lasted unbroken
for more than 2000 years and became a colony of a foreign country. The British
started enjoying the power vested upon them by the treaty and appointed John
D'oyly as a residential representative of the governor for regional affairs. His office
was opened in Kandy and a group of officers was appointed to assist him. The
English government offered positions for the aristocrats who agreed to serve under
the British administration. Thus the people of the upcountry who used to enjoy
an independent ruling system for more than three centuries had to live under an
administration system run by a group of foreign rulers.

2.4. Protests against Foreign Domination
Although the people of the upcountry could escape the obstinate ruling of King
Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe with the arrival of the British to the hill country in
1815, they did not have any partiality to the administration system that continued
thereafter. They, in no time understood that they had lost the independence that
they protected by fighting and sacrificing their lives against the European invaders
like the Portuguese and the Dutch. Therefore, they rose against the English in 1818
and 1848 using their traditional ways of attack. The natives called them as attempts
to win the lost independence back by chasing the foreigners away from the hill
country whereas the British interpreted them as rebellions against the government.
- 32 -
Therefore they became the first freedom struggles that arose against the British
administration. Let’s now discuss the struggle of 1818.
 The Struggle for Freedom in 1818
The armed insurgencies against the English government that existed from September,
1817 to October 1818 in the hill country were called as the Struggle for Freedom in
1818. The aristocrats and the general public moved to such a struggle even before
three years after the English administration started because of the dissatisfaction
they had about the ruling system. This proves that there had been several reasons
that encouraged the hill country people for the 1818 struggle.
 Reasons for the 1818 Struggle
The regret of the loss of a king and the freedom.
It is clear that the people of the upcountry had grievances over the loss of freedom
they enjoyed under a ruling system of their own even during the times when the low
country was governed by the Portuguese and the Dutch.
Even though it was announced after the colonization that the king of Britain was
the king of the upcountry also; the people of the hill country had never seen the so
called king. They wanted a king who lived in their capital city, who could listen to
their grievances and give solutions to them instead of a never seen king who lived
in a country thousands of miles away. Because they could not see a king they tend
to believe that the country was throneless. The following two poems believed to be
composed by a monk who lived those days displaying the distress they had because
they did not have a king.
Oh! Dear ants
you have a king
what can we do
this is our destiny
when will we have a king

respect with pageants
chant with “sadu sadu”

Therefore they became the first freedom struggles that arose against the British
administration. Let’s now discuss the struggle of 1818.
 The Struggle for Freedom in 1818
The armed insurgencies against the English government that existed from September,
1817 to October 1818 in the hill country were called as the Struggle for Freedom in
1818. The aristocrats and the general public moved to such a struggle even before
three years after the English administration started because of the dissatisfaction
they had about the ruling system. This proves that there had been several reasons
that encouraged the hill country people for the 1818 struggle.
 Reasons for the 1818 Struggle
The regret of the loss of a king and the freedom.
It is clear that the people of the upcountry had grievances over the loss of freedom
they enjoyed under a ruling system of their own even during the times when the low
country was governed by the Portuguese and the Dutch.
Even though it was announced after the colonization that the king of Britain was
the king of the upcountry also; the people of the hill country had never seen the so
called king. They wanted a king who lived in their capital city, who could listen to
their grievances and give solutions to them instead of a never seen king who lived
in a country thousands of miles away. Because they could not see a king they tend
to believe that the country was throneless. The following two poems believed to be
composed by a monk who lived those days displaying the distress they had because
they did not have a king.
Oh! Dear ants
you have a king
what can we do
this is our destiny
when will we have a king

respect with pageants
chant with “sadu sadu”

 Emergence of Problems about Religion and Culture
The people of the hill country did not believe that a set of foreigners who are not
Buddhists would give the same protection that would be given by a Buddhist king
although the English had promised in the 5th statement of the upcountry treaty to
protect Buddhism. This is evident in the statements such as, conducting pageants
and chanting ‘sadu, sadu’. Another example for this is the support of monks for the
struggle.
The people of the hill country suspected that their traditions and culture would
be destroyed in the hands of foreigners. Under a traditional ruling system a king’s
major duty was to protect the customs. There were a number of traditions regarding
the palace, courts and administration matters. Uniforms were designed for each
post under the old administration in a way that they were honoured and respected.
But, the English soldiers who came to the Kandy city did not follow those traditions.
As a result, a gap was created between the British and the people of the hill country
religiously as well as culturally. This generated a desire for freedom in the hearts of
the upcountry people.
 Attacks on the Upcountry Aristocrats
Although the British continued with the traditional upcountry posts according to
the 1815 treaty, the social status and the power of the aristocrats were not stable.
They had complained to D'oyly that the British soldiers did not respect them. The
traditional earnings of the aristocrats too were challenged. One example for this
is the loss of income the aristocrats suffered because the English cancelled the
tax called “kadwath badda”. The British could change the traditional posts of the
aristocrats as well. There was a tradition to always appoint a Sinhalese to the post
of ‘Madihe Mohandiram’ who was in charge of upcountry transport. But the British
breaking this tradition, appointed a Muslim called ‘Hajji Marikkar’ to this post.
This created a distress among the aristocrats of Uva Wellassa. They tend to lead the
struggle because their privilege, status and earnings were attacked in many ways.
 Nature of the Struggle
While there was a growing displeasure about the British administration among the
upcountry people, a person called Doresami emerged from Wellassa who claimed
to be an heir to the throne. The Badulla agent Douglas Wilson, came to know that
he was gathering forces to regain the kingdom with the help of the local elite like
‘Kohu Kumbure Rate Rala’. Hence, Douglas Wilson sent a platoon with Hajji
Muhandiram to arrest Doresami. Yet, he was killed by the rebels. Then Douglas
- 34 -
Wilson too was killed by an archer when he set out to arrest Doresami. When the
government noticed that the people of Wellassa were gathering around Doresami,
they sent Kappetipola who was in charge of Uva to control the situation. Nevertheless,
Keppetipola returned the English troops that came with him and joined the rebels.
This resulted in the fights spreading to many parts of the upcountry. Among the
aristocrats, only Molligoda and Eknaligoda Disawe did not join the fights.
Doresami was declared the upcountry king by the rebels under the guidance of
Kappetipola. Kappetipola Disawe was appointed the Mahaadikaram of the new king.
Another problem the British faced was the Tooth Relic which was believed to be the
symbol of the kingship falling into the hands of rebels. Ehelepola too was suspected
by the British because of the close kinship he had with the other aristocrats who
were leading the struggle though he did not join the fights. Because of that he was
arrested and brought to Colombo by the British.
too vicious
The British were
suppressing the battle. The governor
imposed martial law to the upcountry
in February, 1818. The British troops
that were there in the coastal regions
were summoned to the upcountry. They
followed a land sweeping policy to wipe
out the rebels. Setting fire to villages,
arresting as many men as possible and
prosecuting under martial
law were
some strategies they used. The upcountry
people could not persist with the battle
in the face of the harsh retaliation of
the British. So, the British were able to
arrest several leaders of the battle. Some
of those arrested were Maththamagoda,
Kobbekaduwa, Dambawinna Disawe
and Galagedara Mohottala, Basnayaka
Nilame of Katharagama, Butawe Rate
Rala and Ehelepola Adikaram.
The English spread news saying that the
one who said to be the king in the battle
was not the real Doresami and he was not the real heir to the throne. There were
disputes among the main leaders of the struggle such as Kappetipola, Madugalle
Fig 2.9 – Kappetipola Disawe
- 35 -
and Pilimathalawe. By August and September of 1818, the battle had died down a
lot. The English were able to arrest Kappetipola and Madugalle in October. They
were sentenced to death by the court martial. They were executed by the British on
the 26th of November, 1818.
 Failure of the 1818 Battle and Its Effects
The rebellion spread fast within a few months after the beginning. When the British
forces chased away the rebels from one area by destroying property, the battle
started in another place. Yet, the upcountry people failed to launch a combined
attack when the English started a heavy retaliation with extra forces. They had an
advantage when it became possible for them to keep contact with Colombo via
Sathara Korala because the in-charge of that area, Molligoda Nilame was partial to
the British. Thus, there were several reasons for the loss of the battle. Some of them
can be summarized as follows.
 Reasons for the failure of the 1818 Battle:
 The heavy retaliation launched by the British
 Shortage experienced by the upcountry people, of weapons and other resources
that are needed for a long battle
 Disorganized nature of the battle
 The exposure of the real identity of the person who claimed to be the heir to
the throne.
As a result of the battle for freedom, leaders like Ehelepola, Kappitipola, Madugalle
had to sacrifice their lives for the independence of the country. Property of some
more aristocrats were confiscated. Some leaders who supported the battle were
banished from the country. Those who went against the government were punished
thus whereas the other aristocrats like Molligoda, Eknaligoda who were partial to
the English were rewarded.
The British were able to strengthen their grip of the upcountry region because
the 1818 battle was lost. The governor, Brownrigg issued a special announcement
strengthening his power in the upcountry on the 21st of November, 1818. This long
document which consisted of 56 statements curtailed the power of the aristocrats.
Steps were taken to establish the English legal system in the upcountry reducing the
legal power enjoyed by the aristocrats. It seems that the 1818 November document
made the British power in the upcountry complete.
 Struggle for Independence in 1848
In about 30 years following the failure of the 1818 struggle, there was another battle
against the British government. This struggle which tried for the second time to
reestablish the imperial system the upcountry people used to have, can be named as
the second armed battle for the independence. There were several reasons that led
to the emergence of such a battle which began in 1848.
 Causes of the Battle
There were two major factors that led to the 1848 struggle as the effects of the
Colebrooke reforms and the new tax policy of the government.
 Effects of the Colebrooke Reforms
Land Policy of the Government
The government launched a policy of selling lands under the Colebrooke reforms
which were started in 1833. The government land policy was problematic for the
general public of the area because the land in the upcountry was rich and the
environment was conducive for coffee cultivation. According to the Barron Land
Act imposed in 1840, uncultivated lands that could not be proven of their continual
ownership for 30 years were confiscated. There were no legal documents to prove the
ownership of lands of the upcountry people that came to them from their descent.
As a result, many of their Chena lands were taken back to the government. The
government sold these lands for very cheaper prices to the foreigners. Because the
people lost their lands and the cultivation was disturbed thus, they were distressed
about the government.
Discontinuation of “Gam Sabha”
The existence of ‘Gam Sabha’ was challenged because the compulsory service
system and the duty labour system were banned by the Colebrooke Commission.
The building and maintenance of lakes, bunds, canals and dams of each area were
done by the Gam Sabha (village council). The major method the Gam Sabha got
labour was the system called "duty labour". Yet, when this method was cancelled,
the Gam Sabha found it difficult to get necessary labour forces. The Gam Sabha
did a good service by solving the minor problems in the area. But, they lost their
judiciary power due to the reforms in 1833. The villagers had to suffer due to such
reasons.

against the British government. This struggle which tried for the second time to

the Gam Sabha found it difficult to get necessary labour forces. The Gam Sabha
did a good service by solving the minor problems in the area. But, they lost their
judiciary power due to the reforms in 1833. The villagers had to suffer due to such
reasons.
- 37 -
New Judiciary System
Villagers had to go to courts even for a small matter according to Cameron’s legal
reforms. Earlier, they could get such matters resolved in their villages. They were
not aware either of the English language or the rules and regulations that were in
function in the new courts. Some other problems the villagers had to face were that
they had to pay all lawyers’ charges, stamp fees in cash and had to spend days in the
court when they went for legal matters. As a result, their agricultural work including
the protection of their cultivations was neglected.
Distancing Relationship between the People and the Government
The decisions to reduce the number of civil service posts and allowing the civil
servants to engage themselves in estate cultivation following the Colebrooke
recommendations, made the local administration inefficient. As a result, the area
of the administration officer expanded and they found it difficult to supervise such
a big area. Because some officers were more attentive on cultivation, they did not
have enough time to attend to the needs of the people. As a result, the problems of
the general public were not properly informed to the government and it affected to
widen the relationship between the people and the government.
The New Tax Policy of the Government
The closest reason for the struggle was the decision of the governor, Sir Torrington
to impose new taxes in 1848. Because the government income had gone down, the
governor made a tax reform with the purpose of earning a considerable sum from
the people. A stamp fee, cart and catamaran tax, tax on shops, tax on guns, body tax,
and tax on dogs were those new taxes. People opposed all those taxes; especially the
protest against the taxes on guns, body and dogs was significant.
The villagers used guns to protect their cultivations. They had to pay two shillings
and a half every year for the tax on guns. The villagers had to go to government
offices for this and to fill in the forms in English language. They had to pay
extra charges in addition to the time spent. Charges they had to pay for the guns
sometimes exceeded the real value of the guns. There was a resistance for the tax on
guns because of the above reasons.
Every grown up male had to work in building roads for six days every year and
if they failed to do so they had to pay three shillings as a tax on their body. There
was opposition for this tax also. People had to pay taxes for dogs in 1848. This was
an unwise decision and there was an elevated resistance against this tax also. The
government conducted a survey for the collection of statistics called the ‘Blue Book’
at the same time when new taxes were imposed. The people suspected this move too
as a way of imposing more taxes.
 Nature of the 1848 Struggle
Fights began between the government and the people when people gathered to
oppose the tax policy of the government. People gathered in major cities such as
Colombo, Galle, Kandy and Badulla and they protested against the English civil
servants in these rallies. Some farmers that gathered in Badulla smashed their guns
on the ground in front of the government agents to show their displeasure. Around
4000 people gathered in front of the Kandy Kachcheri and protested against these
taxes. Armed forces had to be summoned because the police could not control those
crowds. The protests that began in Colombo and Kandy spread to areas like Matale,
Dambulla, Wariyapola and Kurunegala.
People in areas like Matale, Wariyapola and Kurunegala organized themselves with
arms and attacked the government buildings like courts. As the people were under
high pressure due to the tax policy of the government, leaders like Gongalegoda
Banda, Puran Appu, Dingirala and Diyes emerged from people and led the battle.
A group of rebels gathered in the Dambulla temple and coronated Gongalegoda
Banda as the king with the help of the chief incumbent.
Matale was the centre of the battle in 1848. In addition to this, fights spread to some
parts of the Kandy and Kurunegala districts. But, the English using their experience
of the 1818 battle overpowered the insurgency soon. The struggle soon broke down
due to the suppression launched by the governor, Torrington employing the armed
forces. As a result, the British were able to arrest many of the leaders within two
months of the battle. Gongalegoda Banda, who was arrested so, was trialed, whipped
and exiled from the country. Puran Appu was sentenced to death and he faced death
bravely. Some other fighters were imprisoned. At the same time, there was a strong
indignation against the government because the arrested Rev. Kadahapola Thero
was shot and killed after a very short trial without taking proper legal actions.
 Failure of the Battle
The major reason for the failure of the struggle was its disorganized nature similar to
the 1818 battle. The majority of the rebels were from the general public who did not
have any armed training or proper weapons. The British had good knowledge about

the roads in the hill country by that time and the rebels could not fight against the
military power, strategies and the weapons of the British. The British could retaliate
the battle easily because it was limited to several areas of the upcountry.
The English government appointed a special committee to probe into the situation
of this country because the governor, Torrington’s conduct in 1848 battle was highly
criticized. As a result he was summoned back to England. Taxes that generated
public displeasure were given up. Accordingly, the trade shop tax and dog tax were
abolished. The rest of the taxes were revised and reformed. More attention was paid
on Buddhism because there was displeasure among the people about the way the
British treated it. A special attention was paid to solving the problems of farmers
though no proper steps were taken for that before 1850.

National Renaissance in
Sri Lanka
Introduction
The era in which Sri Lanka tried to win independence after the fights in 1848, is
divided into two periods as national and religious renaissance and then the time of
political agitation.
From 1850 to 1915 the campaign on national and religious renaissance was
prominent whereas from 1915 to 1948 people gave more prominence to political
agitations.
There were impediments to the existence of the culture and traditional religions
after the British conquered the hill country in 1815. As a result Buddhists, Hindus
and Muslims of the country were religiously and nationally aroused towards the
end of the 19th century. That situation is explained as national renaissance in this
lesson.
3.1 Background of the National Renaissance
The Europeans tried to spread their religion and culture in the areas they conquered
in Asia in order that they have a loyal group of people in those countries. When
the Portuguese and the Dutch governed the coastal regions of the country, they
had to restrict their religious and cultural activities to the areas they governed,
because there was an independent kingdom in the upcountry. Doors opened for
the western culture to spread under the British reign throughout the country, with
the submission of the upcountry.
 Activities of Missionary Organizations
Several foreign organizations that came to Sri Lanka during the British reign started
spreading Catholicism in the country. They are called as missionary organizations.
Given below are some such missionary organizations that came to this country
from 1804 to 1818.

 Preaching and Education
London Missionary Organization

American Missionary Organization
Church Missionary Organization
These missionary group members engaged themselves in activities of spreading
religion in different areas of the country. Baptists functioned from Colombo.
Wesleyans worked in the North and the East. The American missionary organization
worked in the North including Jaffna. Church missionaries functioned in Colombo,
Galle, Kalpitiya, Mannar and Kandy. They used the three methods; writing,
preaching and education in spreading their religions.
 Using the Written Medium
The missionary organizations that came to Sri Lanka possessed funds and
organizational ability to establish publishers for printing of books and magazines.
The missionary priests studied the native languages such as Sinhalese and Tamil to
overcome a major problem they had, i. e. inability to use native languages. Later,
they started to translate the Bible into Sinhalese and print and distribute books,
newspapers and magazines. Some such publications were;

The missionary priests did preaching in temples and public places for the
perpetuation of their religions. At the same time they dedicated to starting and
conducting schools. In schools maintained by the missionaries a prominent place
was given to spread the religion. The government assistance was given to missionary
education. English knowledge was necessary to get a government post during
the English reign. Therefore, the Sinhalese and Tamil children had to attend the
missionary schools to get English knowledge.
3.2 Buddhist Renaissance
There was a necessity of replying to what the missionaries said about traditional
religions. They criticized some Buddhist and Hindu traditions in their preaching
and publications saying that worshipping statues was futile. Another need arose
of lifting up the education of native languages because there was no government
assistance for the education of native languages such as Sinhalese and Tamil.
The Buddhist monks became the pioneers to find solutions to these problems.
A landmark in Buddhist education field was the establishment of the Parama
Dhamma Chethiya Pirivena in Rathmalana by Rev. Walane Siddhartha thero. This
pirivena produced a group of both lay and ordained pundits who studied languages
like Sinhalese, Pali and Sanscrit and those who valued the indigenous culture. Rev.
Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala thero who was among them started the Vidyodaya
Pirivena at Maligakanda in 1873. Rev. Ratmalane Dhammaloka thero established
the Vidyalankara Pirivena at Peliyagoda in 1875. As a result of the re-establishment
of pirivena system, more educated people were created and it became a blessing for
the Buddhist renaissance.
 Establishment of Publishers
Rev. Bulathgama Dhammalankara Siri Sumanathissa thero took steps to open a
press which many Buddhists longed to have for a long time. The thero worked to get
financial assistance from the King of Thailand (Siam) because the funds collected
from Sri Lankan philanthropists were not enough for the purpose. Another
significant landmark in Buddhist renaissance is the establishment of ‘Lankopakara
Printers’ using the money collected thus in 1862 at Galle. After that, several presses
were established in several places of the country by the Buddhists. Some such
Buddhist publishers were;
• Lankabinawa Vishratha printers
• Kawatakathika printers
• Sudarshana printers
• Sarasavi Sandaresa Printers

- 43 -
Buddhists were able to publish a lot of magazines and newspapers since a number
of publishers were there after 1862.
Some such Buddhist publications were;
• Lakmini Pahana
• Lankalokaya
• Sarasavi Sandaresa
• Sinhala Jathiya
• Sinhala Bauddhaya
 Engagement in Public Debates
Public debates give evidence to how the Buddhists used the mode of preaching
in reply to the preaching of missionaries for the perpetuation of their religion.
Buddhist monks were the forerunners in conducting
such debates with missionary priests. Rev.
Migettuwaththe Gunananda thero was a prominent
character among them. He who resided in Kotahena
Deepaduththaramaya rendered a yeoman service
for the Buddhist renaissance. Educated monks like
Rev. Hikkaduve Sumangala thero, Rev. Waskaduwe
Subuthi thero, Rev. Pothuwila Indrajothi thero and
Rev. Rathmalane Dhammaloka thero extended
their support to Rev. Migettuwaththe Gunananda
thero in the debates held with Christians. Five such
debates are termed as ‘Five Great Debates’ (Pancha
Maha Wadha).

Among these debates Panadura Wadaya received international fame. Henry Steel
Olcott who was impressed by reading a book about the arguments between Rev.
Migettuwaththe Gunananda thero and the Christians that took place in Panadura
wadaya came to Sri Lanka.
 Establishment of Buddhist Schools
Although the Buddhists had developed a lot in preaching and written medium,
they could not establish a Buddhist school system to compete with the missionary
education system. Buddhists did not have sufficient funds and organizational ability
to establish and run schools. After Sir Olcott came to Sri Lanka Buddhists also found
this opportunity. Sir Henry Steel Olcott came to Sri Lanka, became a Buddhist and
pioneered to start Buddhist schools although he was a foreigner.
 Sir Henry Steel Olcott
Sir Olcott gave guidance in starting the ‘Colombo Parama Vignanartha Movement’
in June 1880. It was an organization in which both lay and ordained could work
together. Then, it branched out to some major cities like Galle, Kandy and Ratnapura.
One of the major achievements of the movement was the establishment of Buddhist
schools for Buddhist students. A fund was set under the guidance of Sir Olcott for
the above purpose. An enthusiasm was generated among the Buddhists to start new
schools because Sir Olcott went from village to village with monks to collect funds.
Names of some individuals who were active in the process of establishing schools;
• Sir Henry Steel Olcott

Among these debates Panadura Wadaya received international fame. Henry Steel
Olcott who was impressed by reading a book about the arguments between Rev.
Migettuwaththe Gunananda thero and the Christians that took place in Panadura
wadaya came to Sri Lanka.
 Establishment of Buddhist Schools
Although the Buddhists had developed a lot in preaching and written medium,
they could not establish a Buddhist school system to compete with the missionary
education system. Buddhists did not have sufficient funds and organizational ability
to establish and run schools. After Sir Olcott came to Sri Lanka Buddhists also found
this opportunity. Sir Henry Steel Olcott came to Sri Lanka, became a Buddhist and
pioneered to start Buddhist schools although he was a foreigner.
 Sir Henry Steel Olcott
Sir Olcott gave guidance in starting the ‘Colombo Parama Vignanartha Movement’
in June 1880. It was an organization in which both lay and ordained could work
together. Then, it branched out to some major cities like Galle, Kandy and Ratnapura.
One of the major achievements of the movement was the establishment of Buddhist
schools for Buddhist students. A fund was set under the guidance of Sir Olcott for
the above purpose. An enthusiasm was generated among the Buddhists to start new
schools because Sir Olcott went from village to village with monks to collect funds.

All the above mentioned philanthropists gave financial assistance in opening
Buddhist schools. Because of this dedication they were able to start Buddhist schools
in several cities of Sri Lanka. Some of those schools are;
• Ananda Vidyalaya – Colombo
• Dharmaraja Vidyalaya – Kandy
• Mahinda Vidyalaya – Galle
• Vijaya Vidyalaya – Matale
• Jinaraja Vidyalaya – Gampola
• Anurudhdha Vidyalaya – Nawalapitiya
There was a development in printing sector because of the Buddhist renaissance and
this led people to develop their intelligence by reading various books, magazines and
newspapers. Because of this motivation for education, their literacy was improved.
Missionary organizations worked to develop the English education. Other important
incidents that took place during the Buddhist renaissance were the getting the
government to declare the Vesak full moon poya day as a
holiday and the introduction of the Buddhist flag which
is in use even today.
Because of the establishment of Buddhist schools and
pirivens, a religious younger generation that understood
the value of the culture emerged. Among those youths,
there were true sons of the motherland and a group
of national writers who highlighted the greatness of
the indigenous culture. The leaders like Anagarika
Dharmapala, Walisinghe Harischandra, Piyadasa Sirisena
and John De Silva among those youths used different
types of media to arouse patriotism and nationalism
among the natives. As a result, by the on set of the 20th century, a movement to kindle
patriotism among the natives, a movement to protect Buddhist religious places and
a non-alcoholic movement had been started through the Buddhist renaissance.
Fig 3.4 – Walisinghe
Harishchandra
 Movement to upgrade Patriotism and Nationalism
The prime intention of this movement was to create countrymen who love their
country by encouraging them to value the indigenous culture because during the
British reign people started imitating the western culture due to the influence of the
fast spreading western culture in the country.
- 46 -
Anagarika Dharmapala presented a new vision elucidating the importance of past
civilization and the value of harmonious living as Buddhists. He worked for this
target by preaching in public and writing to the publications like ‘Sinhala Bauddhaya’
and the magazine ‘Mahabodhi.’
Mr. Piyadasa Sirisena criticized the tendency of Sri Lankans
to embrace the western culture unscrupulously, through his
novels and the newspapers like “Sinhala Jathiya.” Other
than them, a number of Buddhist monks and lay scholars
started briefing the citizens on appreciating the indigenous
culture.
Fig 3.5 – Anagarika Dharmapala
 Protection of Buddhist Religious Places
People were enthusiastic to restore and protect the Buddhist monuments situated in
the ancient cities like Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa which were in decay covered
by forests after the downfall of those kingdoms. The knowledge of general public
about ancient culture and the national heritage expanded when the European scholars
like George Turner, Riis David, H.C.P. Bell and Henri Parker uncovered elements of
ancient culture through research, excavations and exploration of historical sources
and when the local scholars wrote books in parallel to those of the above mentioned
European scholars. In the same atmosphere, Walisingha Harischandra dedicated
for a movement to protect the religious places in Anuradhapura. Anagarika
Dharmapala fought hard to protect the religious places like Buddhagaya in India. At
the same time, the renovations of Ruwanweli Seya also commenced around 1870.

in Sri Lanka, including details about the following points.
- Establishment of presses
- Conducting debates
- Establishment of Buddhist schools
- Movements to upgrade patriotism and nationalism
- Protection of Buddhist religious places

 Temperance Movement
The spreading of alcoholism in the island under the British administration became
a social problem. Therefore, the leaders of the Buddhist renaissance movement
enlightened the people against alcohol consumption. Buddhist monks played a major
role in this regard and the leaders like Anagarika Dharmapala, Piyadasa Sirisena, and
John De Silva briefed people using different media. Anagarika Dharmapala engaged
himself in this process through public preaching and newspapers. Piyadasa Sirisena
used the dialogues between the characters of his novels to teach the people about
the bad effects of alcohol. John De Silva explained the harmful nature of alcohol
through his drama. In the ‘Sura Act’ of his drama, ‘Sinhala Parabhawa’ dangers of
alcohol consumption was clearly depicted.
3.3 Hindu Religious Renaissance
There was a religious and a cultural renaissance among the Hindus of this country
due to the challenge created to Hinduism as a result of the perpetuation of
missionaries. This Hindu renaissance movement was led by Arumuga Navalar. He
had good understanding about missionary activities because he had got his primary
education in a missionary school and had served under a priest of the Methodist
assembly. Therefore, he worked to establish schools for Hindus and establish presses,
brief Hindus by printed leaflets, books and public preaching.
 Arumuga Navalar
A press was started in Wannaponei, Jaffna under
the guidance of Navalar and the people were briefed
in written medium. He began a newspaper called
‘Udayabhanu’. Another excellent service rendered by
him is the composition of a textbook in three volumes
for the Tamil students. At the same time he translated
and published several prose and poetry books. Periya
Puranam and Skandha Puranam were two of them.
Fig 3.6 – Arumuga Navalar
- 48 -
Arumuga Navalar pioneered to start the Wannaponai Shaiwa Prakasha College in
1849, for the Tamil students in order to give them education which is appropriate to
the Hindu culture. Establishing of Hindu schools was continued by the later founded
assembly of Shaiwa Administration and the assembly for Hindu Education. The
Shiwangala school was started in 1872 in Jaffna for the purpose of giving English
education to Tamil students later became the Hindu Vidyalaya in Jaffna.

After the death of Arumaga Navalar, Sir Ponnabalam Ramanadan and Ponnambalam
Arunachalam worked in dedication to continue the Hindu Renaissance movement.
These two leaders were respected not only by the Tamils but also by the Sinhalese.
Mr. Ponnambalam Ramanadan voiced for the Buddhists when the government
imposed martial law to repress them in 1915. Mr. Ponnambalam Arunachalam
pioneered to found “Sri Lanka National Congress” with the Sinhalese leaders to
gain political power for Sinhalese in 1919.
3.4 Islamic Renaissance
In parallel to the Buddhist and Hindu renaissance there was an Islamic renaissance
among the Muslims too. In the same way Arumuga Navalar led the Hindu
renaissance, M.C. Siddhi Lebbe took leadership in generating enthusiasm in the
minds of Muslims to protect the Islamic religion and culture. He who was an Islamic
devotee that came to Sri Lanka from Egypt in 1883, dedicated to make the Arabic
Islamic renaissance a success.
- 49 -
 Mr. Siddhi Lebbe
Mr Siddhi Lebbe’s prime goal was to create an interest
among Muslims for education and encourage them
to study English and Arabic languages. A newspaper
called ‘Muslim Nevisian” was started in 1882 under
his guidance. Then, the Colombo Zahira College was
established for Muslim children under Mr. Siddhi
Lebbe’s guidance. Then he started an organization
called “Muslim Academic Club” for the continuation of
the education of Muslim people. Islamic schools called
“Madrasa” were restructured to meet the new needs of
education.
Fig 3.9 – Mr. Siddhi

After Mr. Siddhi Lebbe, Mr. T.B. Jayah dedicated to continue
the interest of Muslims for education. As the principal of
Colombo Sahira College, he developed the school a lot. He
rendered a yeomen service as a politician and by pioneering
to start schools for Muslims around the country too.

Political Changes in
Sri Lanka under the British
C H A P T E R
Introduction
The British governed the entire island for 133 years from 1815 when the upcountry
surrendered to the British until Sri Lanka was granted independence in 1948. The
British introduced several constitutional reforms to the country from time to time.
Sri Lankans, who were not contented with those reforms, engaged themselves in
continuous protests demanding more power to be enjoyed in administration. As
a result of these protests, they were able to win the administrative power back
in 1948 for themselves. The details of the constitutional reforms introduced to
the island by the British and the protests of the Sri Lankans are discussed in this
lesson.
4 .1 Colebrooke Reforms of 1833
When the British governors ruled the country after 1815, the expenditure exceeded
the income of the government. As a result, the governors of Sri Lanka had to request
for money from the British government to cover the expenditure of the country.
Spending money for the functioning of colonies was not the policy of Britain.
Therefore, the secretary to the colonies appointed W.H.G. Colebrooke (William
Mac Bean George Colebrooke) to probe into the situation of Sri Lanka and make
recommendations. In1829, he came to Sri Lanka and his duty was to investigate
into the political and economic situation of the country. Charles Hae Cameron was
appointed by the secretary to the colonies to probe into the existing situation in the
legal system and courts and give recommendations. He came to Sri Lanka in 1830
following this appointment. A constitutional reform was introduced to the country
based on the suggestions of the Colebrooke Commission in 1833. It is named as the
Colebrooke reforms. According to the recommedations of Cameron, the judicial
system was also reformed.

Political Changes in
Sri Lanka under the British
Introduction
The British governed the entire island for 133 years from 1815 when the upcountry
surrendered to the British until Sri Lanka was granted independence in 1948. The
British introduced several constitutional reforms to the country from time to time.
Sri Lankans, who were not contented with those reforms, engaged themselves in
continuous protests demanding more power to be enjoyed in administration. As
a result of these protests, they were able to win the administrative power back
in 1948 for themselves. The details of the constitutional reforms introduced to
the island by the British and the protests of the Sri Lankans are discussed in this
lesson.
4 .1 Colebrooke Reforms of 1833
When the British governors ruled the country after 1815, the expenditure exceeded
the income of the government. As a result, the governors of Sri Lanka had to request
for money from the British government to cover the expenditure of the country.
Spending money for the functioning of colonies was not the policy of Britain.
Therefore, the secretary to the colonies appointed W.H.G. Colebrooke (William
Mac Bean George Colebrooke) to probe into the situation of Sri Lanka and make
recommendations. In1829, he came to Sri Lanka and his duty was to investigate
into the political and economic situation of the country. Charles Hae Cameron was
appointed by the secretary to the colonies to probe into the existing situation in the
legal system and courts and give recommendations. He came to Sri Lanka in 1830
following this appointment. A constitutional reform was introduced to the country
based on the suggestions of the Colebrooke Commission in 1833. It is named as the
Colebrooke reforms. According to the recommedations of Cameron, the judicial
system was also reformed.
- 51 -
 Distinguished Features of those Reforms
Several reforms that widely changed the political and economic systems of the
country were introduced under the Colebrooke reforms. Some of the distinguished
features among them were;
• Establishment of the executive and legislative councils.
• Introduction of a ruling system which combined both upcountry and low
country.
• Dividing the island into five provinces.
• Repealing compulsory service system.
• Discontinuation of the trade monopoly of the government.
A special feature of the Colebrooke Commission is the establishment of a legislative
council and an executive council. The governor was exercising an immense power
when the Colebrooke Commission came to Sri Lanka. The commission which
considered the above mentioned fact as an obstacle to the freedom of the general
public proposed to reduce the power of the governor by estabilishing these councils.
There were 15 members in the legislative council appointed in 1833. Nine of them
were official members or those who were appointed in their position. The other 06
were unofficial members. Three of them were selected to represent Europeans and
one member each for the other three ethnicities; Sinhala, Tamil and Burger. The
governor exercised the power of appointing these 06 members.

Appointing unofficial members to the legislative council according to their ethnicity
is called the nationalist representative system. This nationalist representative system
produced harmful results to the country in the future.
4.2 The 1910 Reforms and their Background
 Demands of the Sri Lankan Middle Class
The unofficial members who represented the general public could not exercise
their power because the majority of the council was official members. The governor
could appoint members who were loyal to him because it was he who exercised the
power of appointing the unofficial members. As a result, the legislative council was
loyal to the governor.
Colebrooke had recommended appointing a group including the secretary of the
colony, treasurer, accountant, head surveyor, cashier of the Colombo customs
department to the executive council which was appointed in 1833. The purpose of
appointing this council was to limit the excessive power exercised by the governor in
financial matters. Hence the governor was ordered to discuss all matters regarding
income and expenditure with the executive council. Though the governor was not
bound to follow the advice of the executive council, he was required to seek the
approval of the secretary to the colonies in such a situation.
 Struggles of Europeans
It was a group of European businessmen that first launched a struggle to get certain
areas of the Colebrooke reforms amended. There were three unofficial members in
the legislative council to represent the Europeans who were living in the country.
Those Europeans who were engaged in estate cultivation in the country wanted to
get roads, railways and other infrastructure that was necessary for estate cultivation
developed. Yet, it was difficult to get financial allocations for the above mentioned
sections because at the beginning, administrative power was not vested upon
the legislative council. At the same time, they were not happy of the fact that the
number of unofficial members in the legislative council was the minority. They
further opposed to the fact that they were appointed by the governor without using
franchise for that. They started a limited struggle demanding the above changes.
Their methods of struggle were; asking questions in the legislative council, making
proposals, publishing articles in newspapers, establishing organizations for struggle
etc. One such organization was Lanka Congress established in 1865 and headed
by George Wall. The number of unofficial members in the legislative council was
increased to 08 because of these protests. The two new members were selected for
the upcountry Sinhalese and Muslims. Though the objective of Europeans’ struggle
was not to give administration power to Sri Lankans, those Sri Lankans took these
struggles as examples.
During the 19th century a significant change occurred in the economy and the
society due to the Colebrooke reforms. As a result of this, the old elite class faded
out paving the way to a new Sri Lankan middle class to appear by the beginning of
the 20th century. In parallel to the changes that took place in the economy and the
society during the 70 years after 1833, no change occurred in the political system.
As the Sri Lankan middle class was unhappy about this, they began to demand for a
constitutional reform during the period between 1908 - 1909.
Mr.James Pieris presented a formal petition for the first time to the secretary of the
colonies requesting a constitutional reform in December 1908. After that, several
other organizations had followed Mr. James Pieris. Low Country Production Club,
Chilaw Club, Jaffna Club are some of them.
Several of the major demands made by the Sri Lankans are given below.
• Increasing the number of unofficial members in the legislative council
• Discontinuation of the nationalist representative system
• Electing members from provinces according to the provincial representative
system
• Increasing the power of the legislative committee
The governor of Sri Lanka that time, Henry McCallum
opposed to these proposals. He argued that those who
had presented petitions did not represent the general
public. But, the colonial office could not ignore the
logical arguments put forward for constitutional
reforms. Even the colonial officers agreed to the fact
that a constitutional reform is necessary because 75
years had passed after the Colebrooke reforms were
implemented. Thus, in November 1910, the secretary
of the colonies exclaimed that a constitutional reform
would be made. The new constitution designed by the
secretary of the colonies, Lord Crew according to the
recommendations of then governor; Henry McCallum
is called the “Crew – McCallum Constitution”.

 Crew – McCallum Constitution 1910
This constitution which came into effect from 1912 had increased the number of
legislative council members to 21. Out of them, 11 were official members and 10
were unofficial members. Out of the 10 unofficial members, 06 were nominated
according to the nationalist representative system. The other 04 were appointed
selecting 02 for Europeans, 01 for Burgers and 01 for educated Sri Lankans on the
basis of limited franchise.

Distinguished characteristics of the Crew –McCallum reforms
• Opportunity of appointing members to the legislative council using franchise
for the first time
• A member to represent the educated Sri Lankans
• Still the majority of the council was the official members
A distinguished feature of this reform is the ability to exercise franchise in appointing
members to the legislative council. Yet, the franchise was limited because there
were special requirements to be fulfilled to become a voter. Mr. Ponnambalam
Ramanadan was elected as the educated Sri Lankan in 1912.
 Temperance Movement 1912 - 1915
Sri Lankans’ demands were not fully met in the 1910 reforms. The middle class was
not happy about those reforms. A temperance movement was started in protest to
the decision of the government to impose a new excise ordinance in 1912 giving
permission to open new toddy bars.
How a temperance movement emerged through the religious renaissance in protest
to the increasing alcohol consumption during the British reign was explained in
Unit Three. The purpose of this temperance movement was to make people aware
of the harmful effects of alcohol consumption and help them give up the bad habit.
But, protests were staged against the new excise policy of the government in 1912.
The pioneers of this protest were the middle class people who could not win their
demands from 1910 reforms. As a result, these protests in 1912 had a political
inclination. Some distinguished features of these protests were;
• attempting to create a public opinion against the excise policy of the government
• unison of the middle class English educated and the activists of the religious
renaissance
• building up of a network of non-alcoholic associations around the country based
on the central non-alcoholic council in Colombo
• criticizing the government activities in the non-alcoholic protests
Because of the protests in 1912, some taverns were closed and it became difficult to
find places to open new ones. The government was seeking an opportunity to abate
the temperance movement because the activities of the movement were successful
with people gathering around the associations and the government activities were
condemned in their protests. When the situation was thus, there arose riots between
the Sinhalese and the Muslims in Kandy in 1915. It is known as the Sinhalese- Muslim
riots. The government ignored the riots till the situation became extremely tensed
and then took undue advantage of it and tried to suppress the temperance movement.
There, the government arrested a majority of the non-alcoholic leaders and banned
some Sinhala newspapers. On the face of this suppression, the activities of the
temperance movement were badly affected. Nevertheless, some leaders who entered
politics through non-alcoholic activities; like F. R. Senanayake, D. S. Senanayake
and Sir D. B. Jayathilaka later became national leaders.
 Influence of the Indian Nationalist Movement
The British power had spread into both Sri Lanka and India by the 19th century.
There emerged a powerful nationalist movement in India which was a British
colony by the beginning of the 20th century. They staged a strong protest in 1885.
Because of these protests, in 1885 British rulers had to make strong constitutional
changes in India than what they did in Sri Lanka. The leaders like Surendranath

Because of these protests, in 1885 British rulers had to make strong constitutional
changes in India than what they did in Sri Lanka. The leaders like Surendranath
- 57 -
Banerjee, Bal Gangadhar, Thilak, Mahathma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru obtained
the participation of the general public in protests against the British and launched
strong struggles to win the independence which they called, ‘Swarajya.’ The leaders
like Mahathma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru came to Sri Lanka and addressed
the citizens of the country. Mahathma Gandhi came to Sri lanka in 1927 and spent
several days in the country.
The impact of the India’s independence
struggle was felt in Sri Lanka also. The
leaders of this country understood that
presenting petitions and conducting
discussions with the secretary of the
colonies were not going to be sufficient
in winning important political reforms.
Hence, the leaders of this country started
to conduct protests in a more organized
manner after 1915.
Fig. 4.2 Mahathma Gandhi
 Ceylon National Congress
Sri Lankans felt the necessity of getting more power in
administrative matters when the government imposed
martial law and suppressed the people in 1915 during
Sinhala-Muslim riots. Yet, there was no any common
organization to organize political protests even by
1919. Though there were several small organizations
they did not have a strong voice. Therefore, all these
small organizations, came together
in December
1919 and Ceylon National Congress was formed. Mr.
Ponnabalam Arunachalam who was a distinguished
leader in the political protests after 1915 was appointed
the first president in the congress. The prime objective
Fig. 4.3 D.B. Jayathilaka
of establishing the Ceylon National Congress by this time was to organize a strong
struggle in demand of political power, combining all those small organizations
interested in politics. The unison of different ethnic groups such as Sinhalese,
Tamils and Muslims for a common target under the Ceylon National Congress was
an important incident in the history of Sri Lanka.
- 58 -
 Manning Constitutional Reforms -1920
Sri Lankans were able to win these reforms in 1920 through their continuous
struggles because they were not satisfied with the Crew-McCallum constitution.
The number of the members of the Legislative Council was increased to 37 by this
reform. Among them 14 were official members and 23 were unofficial members.
Seven of the unofficial members were nominated by the governor. The other 16
were selected through limited franchise under the provincial representative system.
Though the number of the unofficial members was the majority, in critical situations
the 7 members nominated by the governor tend to join the 14 official members. This
created a majority to the side which is partial to the governor.

Some important characteristics of 1920 constitution:
• Unofficial members became the majority for the first time
• Introduction of the provincial representative system
• Continuation of the ethnic representation
Even in these reforms the power of the governor was not reduced. The demand
of the Ceylon National Congress had been neglected. So, the Sri Lankan leaders
continued to protest. The Ceylon National Congress had an idea to refuse these
reforms at the beginning. As a result, the governor, William Manning promised
to introduce another reform within a short time. There was another constitutional
reform in 1924 following this. It was named as ‘Manning – Devonshire Reforms.’

 Constitutional Reforms in 1924
The number of the legislative council members was increased up to 49 by this reform.
There were 12 official members and 37 unofficial members. Out of these 37, 8 were
nominated by the governor and 29 were elected. The most important feature of this
reform was that the number of elected members was the majority even though the
12 unofficial members and the nominated 8 made 29 in unison. The functioning
of the government was still the responsibility of the governor. Nevertheless, the
power of decision making was in the hands of the members elected by the people
because the governor did not enjoy a majority which was loyal to him. Hence, there
were disturbances to the smooth functioning of the government because it became
a constitution that divided the power and the responsibility into two. Hue Clifford,
the governor who was appointed after William Manning informed this situation to
the colonial office and the Donoughmore Commission was appointed to examine
the situation and make recommendations.
4.3 Donoughmore Constitution – 1931
The Donoughmore Commission which was headed by Lord Donoughmore came to
Sri Lanka in 1927 and got the views of the Sri Lankans. The constitution proposed
based on this came into effect from 1931. It is known as the Donoughmore
Constitution. It is important as Donoughmore reforms entrusted a considerable
amount of political responsibility to Sri Lankans among various constitutional
reforms that existed so far. It can be considered as an important juncture in the
journey towards winning the independence.
Some special characteristics of the Donoughmore Constitution:
A legislative council of 61 members was appointed in this constitution. It was named
as ‘State Council.’ The members were selected as follows to the council.
Elected on the
provincial basis – 50
State officers -03
Nominated by the
governor – 08
State secretary
Financial secretary
Legal secretary
A speaker elected by the members of the council was the chair of the council.
 Universal Franchise
There was limited franchise to elect the members to the Legislative Council
since 1912. At the beginning, if one wanted to be a voter they should possess a
considerable wealth. Therefore, the poor general public could not enjoy franchise.
As a result, the percentage of franchise holders was just 4% of the population as late
as 1924. Females too did not enjoy this franchise. The Donoughmore Commission
explained the fact that the politicians did not pay enough attention to the problems
of the people with low income because those who enjoyed franchise were only the
wealthy class. At the same time, they pointed out the fact that the general public
paid no attention to political issues because they did not enjoy franchise. Therefore,
the commission recommended that all males and females who were above 21 years
were granted franchise irrespective of their wealth and educational qualifications.
As a result of this, Sri Lankans got the universal franchise in 1931. That was a great
victory the general public got.
 Executive Committee System
The relationship between the legislature and the executive was limited before the
Donoughmore reforms. The State Council received power on both legislative and
executive matters under these reforms. After an election, the State Council was
divided into 7 committees. Following are the subjects of those committees.

divided into 7 committees. Following are the subjects of those committees.
- 61 -
• Home affairs
• Agriculture
• Local administration
• Health
• Education
• Transport and common work
• Labour industry and commerce
The chairperson of each committee became the minister of each subject. Thus, the
Donoughmore reforms gifted Sri Lanka with 7 ministers. The ministers could run
the ministry according to the necessities of the people. During the era of the State
Council, the cabinet could launch several projects which were beneficial for the lives
of people. Some of such projects were; setting up of agricultural villages and the
introduction of free education.
 Governor and the Government Officials
The governor’s power was reduced to a greater extent when compared with the
previous constitutions. The governor had to work in unison with the State Council
and the cabinet of ministers. A weakness noticed in the Donoughmore constitution
is, leaving the portfolios of state security, financial matters and legal affairs still in
the hands of the three state officials.
4.4 Protests for Independence
Though the Sri Lankans could enjoy some power in Donoughmore constitution,
still the state officials held the power over a major area of administration. As a
result, from 1931 protests were started requesting a curtailment of the power of the
governor and handing over of the portfolios given to state officials to the Sri Lankan
ministers. In these activities, the State Council and the ministers took the lead in
making requests.
 Sunflower (Suriyamal) Movement
In addition to the protests staged by the cabinet of ministers, the State Council and
the Ceylon National Congress in order to get the administrative power to the Sri
Lankans by changing the Donoughmore constitution, Marxists of the country too
launched a struggle for independence. Communist leaders like Dr. N.M. Perera
and Dr. Colvin R. De Silva who formed the Lanka Sama Samaja Party used the
‘Suriyamal movement’ as a mode of providing publicity to the protests they staged
requesting independence.
The Suriyamal movement was started against the
‘Poppy movement’. Selling poppy flowers was started in
order to collect funds in aid of the families of soldiers
who were disabled in World War I. November 11th is
considered the day of ending wars and poppy flowers
are sold on that day every year. In addition to that,
parades and festivals were conducted to show the
loyalty of Sri Lanka to the British Empire. The money
collected by selling poppy flowers was sent to Britain.

A campaign of selling sunflowers was started by
the emancipated soldiers’ guild on the same day when poppy flowers were sold.
Later, the leftist leaders joined the ‘Suriyamal movement’. The money collected by
selling sunflowers was spent for the betterment of the poor of this country. The
Communists announced that buying poppy flowers is being loyal to imperialism
because the money collected by selling poppy flowers was
sent to Britain and wearing sunflowers is a way of taking
part in the struggle for independence. The British policies
were criticized by the propagations that said poppy flowers
were a symbol of slavery and sunflowers were a symbol
of independence. Thus, “Suriyamal movement” became a
publicity campaign of the protests for independence.
 Cabinet of Ministers and the National Congress

The British needed the support of the Sri Lankans when the World War II began in
1939. Though the cabinet of ministers agreed to give support to Britain, it was under
the condition that a new constitutional reform is granted at the end of the war. A
special defence bureau was appointed during the war to maintain security in Sri
Lanka and the then minister of agriculture, Mr. D. S. Senanayake was also appointed
to that bureau. The governor and the other high officials were impressed with the
support extended to them by the cabinet of ministers and requested Britain to
propose a new constitution for Sri Lanka which would meet the demands of the Sri
Lankans at the end of the war. As a result of that, the cabinet of ministers was
permitted to draft a new constitution suitable for Sri Lanka under certain

restrictions. In the constitution drafted in 1944 by the
cabinet of ministers, they had proposed a parliamentary
system in which the complete authority of internal
affairs would lie in the hands of the Sri Lankans.
The Ceylon National Congress too started struggles
making independence of Sri Lanka their prime
objective. They worked in unison with the cabinet of
ministers during this period.

 Soulbury Constitution
The Soulbury Commission was appointed in 1944 to give proposals for a new
constitution considering the draft of the cabinet of ministers and the demands of the
Sri Lankans. The report which was published in 1945 had proposed a parliamentary
system.
This report was much similar to that of the cabinet of ministers. The approval of
the Soulbury constitution by the State Council in November, 1945 with a majority
of votes was an important incident. You can learn more about the nature of the
Soulbury constitution and the independence of Sri Lanka in Unit Six.

Social Changes in Sri Lanka
under the British
There were a long continued ruling system, social economic system and a culture
in Sri Lanka when it was captured by the British. Yet, there were drastic changes in
all those areas by the time Sri Lanka won the independence in 1948. These changes
show the effect of the British rule in Sri Lanka. The previous lesson explained how
the traditional imperial system changed to a parliamentary system during the
British reign. This lesson focuses on the changes that occurred in socio – economic
and cultural aspects of the country during the British rule.
5.1. Economic Changes
The foundation of Sri Lanka's traditional social, economic and cultural systems runs
back to the Anuradapura era. That socio - economic system which was built on the
doctrine of Buddhism from the rule of king Devanampiyatissa began to experience
change after the arrival of Portuguese in the 16th century. The agricultural activities
in Portuguese held areas suffered drawbacks because they paid more attention to
trade during their rule. When the Dutch was in power in the coastal areas, they
grew cinnamon and pepper, etc. targeting export. Furthermore, a group of labourers
started to emerge because the Dutch started some minor industries and a payment
system for the work covered daily. These Europeans failed to make a significant
change in the traditional socio – economic system because the major part of the
island was still under the power of the Kandyan kingdom during the time in which
the coastal areas were governed by the Dutch and the Portuguese.
There existed a social system which was based on the traditional socio-economic
activities when Sri Lanka was captured by the British. There was an elite group in
that society but they were a small minority. The country was mostly governed by
the aristocrats. The greater majority of the country were the general public and they
lived on agriculture.

Social Changes in Sri Lanka
under the British
Introduction
There were a long continued ruling system, social economic system and a culture
in Sri Lanka when it was captured by the British. Yet, there were drastic changes in
all those areas by the time Sri Lanka won the independence in 1948. These changes
show the effect of the British rule in Sri Lanka. The previous lesson explained how
the traditional imperial system changed to a parliamentary system during the
British reign. This lesson focuses on the changes that occurred in socio – economic
and cultural aspects of the country during the British rule.
5.1. Economic Changes
The foundation of Sri Lanka's traditional social, economic and cultural systems runs
back to the Anuradapura era. That socio - economic system which was built on the
doctrine of Buddhism from the rule of king Devanampiyatissa began to experience
change after the arrival of Portuguese in the 16th century. The agricultural activities
in Portuguese held areas suffered drawbacks because they paid more attention to
trade during their rule. When the Dutch was in power in the coastal areas, they
grew cinnamon and pepper, etc. targeting export. Furthermore, a group of labourers
started to emerge because the Dutch started some minor industries and a payment
system for the work covered daily. These Europeans failed to make a significant
change in the traditional socio – economic system because the major part of the
island was still under the power of the Kandyan kingdom during the time in which
the coastal areas were governed by the Dutch and the Portuguese.
There existed a social system which was based on the traditional socio-economic
activities when Sri Lanka was captured by the British. There was an elite group in
that society but they were a small minority. The country was mostly governed by
the aristocrats. The greater majority of the country were the general public and they
lived on agriculture.
- 65 -
The traditional life style of this country was based on the village. It was named as
a local self–sufficient economic system because the people of the village produced
their food in the village itself. There was mutual support and harmony in the village.
There was no working for wages those days. Agriculture was continued, taking help
from each other on daily basis which was called ‘Aththama’. As a result, the use of
money was minimum in that society.
The ‘ Gamsabha ‘(Village Council) settled the minor complaints about minor issues
between villagers. The Gamsabha played a major role in community work such as
building canal bunds, maintenance of lakes, building up of pagodas and roads
before the Kandyan kingdom. The Gamsabha could get the necessary labour for the
above mentioned duties under the traditional duty service system. By the time of
the Kandyan Kingdom ‘Gamsabha’ had become a minor court in the village.
The labour needed for the government was received through the duty service system
by the administration under the ruling system before 1815.There were two ways of
providing service as compulsory service system and duty, based on land occupancy.
In the past, those who supplied compulsory service to the king were awarded land
for their existence. Those who cultivated these lands which were called as service
patrimony lands provided necessary services to the king. Officials who received
these lands gave them to the general public for cultivation and they had to repay it
by providing services through labour. It was called as duty of occupancy.
All adult males of the country had to serve the king for no salary for a decided
number of days every year. This was conducted under the heads of the village and
the Gamsabha . Often, the labour necessary for the common activities of the village
was taken from this compulsory service system.
 Economic Reforms in Colebrooke Commission
The major reason for sending the Colebrooke Commission to Sri Lanka was the
expenditure of the government exceeded the income of the government. Colebrooke
tried to introduce several economic reforms to Sri Lanka because he wanted to
establish an economic system that met the objectives of the English. The government
- 66 -
wanted to invest money on profitable business in order to avoid financial difficulties
the government faced. The objective of the Colebrooke Commission was to build
a situation in which the private entrepreneurs could invest money because the
government could not afford it.
Colebrooke recommended that the government should move into a policy of selling
lands because the existing traditional land tenure system was an obstacle for the
private entrepreneurship. Thus, both the locals and foreigners had the opportunity
to buy land as much as they wanted. The civil servants too got the opportunity of
buying government lands because Colebrooke recommended that all civil servants
are permitted to engage themselves in estate cultivation.
The investors who bought lands wanted labour to cultivate those lands. According
to the traditional compulsory service system, people were forced to work for the
government with no wages. Colebrooke noticed that they were not suitable for
the private entrepreneurship and it was an obstacle for the freedom of the people.
Therefore, he thought of abolishing the compulsory service. As a result, labour
became something that could be bought and that was the beginning of a labour
class that worked for wages in Sri Lanka.
When Colebrooke came to Sri Lanka, cinnamon and salt trade was a government
monopoly. Continuing a government monopoly does not match with the private
entrepreneurship. Therefore it was suggested to break the monopoly on cinnamon
and salt trade and allow the private sector too join that trade. The taxes that were
the government income those days were the levies on fish, land and alcohol and
they were charged directly. For an example, a portion of the fish caught had to be
submitted as tax. The right to earn taxes was auctioned and the fishermen had
to pay the tax in fish to those who had bought the tax right. This direct tax was
proposed to transfer into an indirect tax by issuing permits for boats. Tax on land
was also a direct tax. The authority of tax collection was auctioned and those who
bought it collected taxes from the products of lands. Colebrooke banished it and
recommended to collect an equal amount in cash from all lands.
Colebrooke further recommended the establishment of a savings bank in the island.
The purpose of establishing a bank was to allow the entrepreneurs who invest money
on estate cultivation obtain money to a reasonable interest.
- 67 -
 Development of Plantation
There was a broad change in the economy of Sri Lanka after Colebrooke
recommendations came into effect in 1833. Foreign investors could buy thousands
of acres of land in Sri Lanka because there were no rich people among locals
who could invest in mega scales though Colebrooke wanted to encourage private
entrepreneurship. This was not a secret to Colebrooke too.
Foreigners invested money on trade based agriculture which was profitable in the
foreign market. As a result, there was rapid expansion in plantation sector in the
19th century.
 Plantation of Coffee
Though coffee plantation began during the Dutch period in small scale in coastal
areas, because a prominent place was given to cinnamon plantation, coffee plantation
did not develop. When the English came to Kandy, coffee plantation had been done
in several places as a home cultivation. It developed into a plantation during the
reign of the British. Several factors were there that affected the development of the
coffee plantation in the 19th century.
Factors that helped the development of the coffee plantation:
• More investment on coffee plantation by foreigners after the Colebrooke
reforms in 1833.
• Increasing demand for coffee in the European market.
- 68 -
• High profit drawn through coffee plantation.
• Ability to get cheap labour from the Indian labourers in the plantation sector.
Some other reasons for the expansion of coffee cultivation were the reduction of
export tax for coffee and releasing of the labourers who worked in coffee plantation
from compulsory service system during the time of the governor Edward Barnes
(from 1824 – 1831).
Coffee plantation was expanding fast in the upcountry region during the period
of 1837 -1847. Even the government officers started growing coffee because it was
very profitable. Reports say that there were about 500 acres of coffee plantation in
the hill county by 1845. Thus, the coffee plantation was successful in areas such
as Dumbara valley, Gampola, Peradeniya, Matale, Badulla and many areas of the
Central Province. The amount of coffee export in 1844, was five times bigger than
that of 1834. But after 1844 Sri Lanka had to face a huge challenge in the Landon
market because of the free trade policy of Britain. Furthermore, the downfall of
the global market too affected badly on the coffee plantation of Sri Lanka. Because
of these reasons the demand for coffee decreased and the value of the coffee lands
went down in 1848. But this situation reached normalcy again after 1850 with the
reduction of production cost through efficient estate management and the high
demand for coffee in Europe. The major reason for the downfall of coffee plantation
in Sri Lanka was the leaf disease that spread since 1869. The fungus which was
called “Hemileia Vastatrix” spread fast destroying the coffee plantation.
 Cinchona and Cocoa
When the coffee cultivation began to deteriorate, some planters started growing
cinchona and cocoa. Yet cinchona became successful in areas with very high
altitude only. Cinchona was a plant that was used in the production of the medicine
called quinine and it had a limited demand. Therefore, it was not successful as an
alternative to the coffee plantation.
When the coffee plantation began to deteriorate, the government encouraged
the cocoa plantation. Anyway, the planters had to bear an additional expenditure
because cocoa needed shade in order to grow well. Even during the period when
cocoa had become a successful plantation. It was not spread more than 1200 acres.
It was successful only in Matale district. Cocoa too failed to provide an alternative
to coffee.
- 69 -
 Tea Plantation
Other crops were tried in the upcountry areas because of the fluctuation of coffee
price in the world market. Several such experiments were made on tea plantation
also. The Planters' Association sent a group of estate workers to Assam to study
further about tea plantation in 1867. At the same time, James Tailor too experimented
growing tea in several areas of Lulkandura estate. Tea plantation spread to about
500 acres by 1875 as a result of the above mentioned experiments. Tea plantation
began to expand quickly because many planters took to tea plantation due to the
destruction of coffee cultivation. By 1894 the amount of tea planted area had reached
upto 400,000 acres. Tea plantation spread to the Central, Uva and Sabaragamuwa
provinces because it could be grown in any area with more than 6000 feet of altitude
except in the dry zone of the country. Later it was spread to the Southern and
Western provinces too. It is reported that there had been 1200 acres of tea in average
size and bigger tea estates in the country by 1930.
With this expansion of tea plantation, tea became one of the major export products
in our country. Though the income from tea went down in certain situations due to
the excessive tea product after the World War I and the world economic demise in
1929, later it reached to normalcy.
Factors that helped the development of the tea plantation:
• High demand in the world market for Sri Lankan tea
• Conducive environment for tea in many parts of the country except in the dry
• Ability to produce good quality tea with the help of modern factories and
machines
• Development of transport with the development of roads
• Cheap labour received from south Indian labourers
- 70 -
- 71 -
 Coconut Plantation
increasing
Coconut is a home crop that existed
in Sri Lanka from the past. There
interest on
was an
coconut plantation by 1850 due to
the fall of coffee prices. A significant
characteristic was the enthusiasm
shown by the natives than the
foreigners in the coconut plantation.
By 1880, 65% of coconut estate
owners were Sri Lankans.
Coconut plantation expanded more in broad flat lands than in the hill country.
Areas like Kurunegala, Chilaw and Gampaha were prominent among them. By
1920, 27% of the foreign earnings came from coconut products. A coconut research
institution was established in Lunuwila to develop coconut plantation when the
coconut plantation started to expand. It is clear that coconut plantation did not aim
at export like the other cultivations, owing to the fact that half of the production
was utilized for local consumption. Just as roads and railways developed in the hill
country due to tea and coffee plantation, roads in the other parts of the country
were developed to support the coconut plantation.
 Rubber Plantation
Though rubber was introduced to Sri Lanka around
1877, it did not show quick expansion because many
cultivators during this period were more focused on
tea plantation. By the beginning of the 20th century,
rubber plantation expanded because rubber price
increased due to the expansion of the motor vehicle
indutry, suitable rubber species were found for Sri
Lanka together with the development of production
techniques and temporary fall of tea prices. Rubber
plantation which was limited to Kalutara district
at the beginning later expanded to the Western,
Sabaragamuwa, Southern provinces and some
parts of the Central Province. By 1920, 30% of the
export income was received from rubber products.
Later a rubber research institution was started in Agalawatta to develop the rubber
plantation.

the aristocrats and the emergence of a

had higher economic, social and
political status than the rest of the
community. They were able to hold

A group of new middle class
people
- 75 -
The Colebrooke reforms paved the way to a capitalist economic system in Sri Lanka
opening several new ways of earning money instead of the traditional earning
methods. Among those methods, working as contractors who supplied facilities to
the plantation sector, production and distribution of arrack, graphite mining, whole
sale and retail sale transportation and coconut plantation were the areas in which
locals could invest money on. Thus, at the onset of the 20th century, there was a
local wealthy class that earned money by investing money on the above mentioned
industries. They spent money to give a good education to their sons and daughters
locally as well as internationally. New job opportunities such as lawyers, engineers,
surveyors, clerks and civil servants had emerged by this time. People could demand
a high recognition and better living conditions by getting these jobs through English
education. As a result, it became another open door to enter, the middle class.
There emerged a group of entrepreneurs that manipulated the new earning ways
which were opened during the British reign as well as an educated group that got posts
in the government through English education. They were named as the middle class
because they became prominent among the others because they enjoyed a higher
economic status. With the emergence of this new middle class at the beginning of
the 20th century, the traditional aristocratic group began to fade away.
The educated group in the new middle class became politically active. They pioneered
the political struggles in the 20th century. This group which was named as educated
middle class was those who earned recognition through western education. As a
result they became a group of rich city dwellers who followed the western culture.
 Emergence of a Labour Class
Another significant feature of the British reign is the emergence of a labour class
because of the economic reforms that were made. In the traditional administration
system, labour was taken under the compulsory service system for the common
activities of the government, leaving no necessity of working for wages. Yet because
during the British reign plantation was started in the hill country, labourers were
needed to work in estates. Since India too was a colony of Britain by this time,
bringing labourers from Southern India for a meagre salary was more profitable.
Therefore, the estate owners brought labourers from India in thousands. As a result
a labour community started to grow in the hill country.
New labourers were needed for duties such as loading and unloading goods in
cities like Colombo, Galle and Kandy, washing clothes, transporting goods by carts,
constructing roads and railways because of the new trends of the economy. As a
result, a local group of labourers emerged in the city areas in addition to the south
Indian labourers.
They received a meagre salary at the beginning. The number of hours they worked
was not set. There were no labour insurance, compensation or other labour welfare
activities. As a result, the city labourers started to gather and establish workers’
unions in order to win their rights. They started to strike in order to get their status
developed as they could feel a growing unity among them. Some examples for labour
strikes that took place at the beginning of the 20th century are the strike of printers,
strike of the Colombo launderers and the carters’ strike.
By the third decade of the 20th century the labourers began to organize themselves in
better ways. Mr. E.A. Gunasinghe is a leader who tried to organize the urban labour
community in a better way. He became the most renowned leader of labourers from
1922 to 1935. He pioneered to establish the ‘Ceylon Workers Congress’ marking a
landmark in the history of trade unions in Sri Lanka. The leaders of ‘Lanka Sama
Samaja Party’ led labour struggles establishing trade unions. Mr. Natesa Aiiar led
the establishment of trade unions among the estate labourers.
 Changes in the Culture
The Sri Lankan culture experienced heavy changes during the British reign parallel
to the changes in the society. The most significant change was the spreading of
western culture in the country. The western education and studying of English
language began to spread fast in the country after the Colebrooke reforms. It was
the foreigners that prepared the curricula and conducted teaching in missionary
schools and state aided schools. These schools too paved the way for the spreading
of western culture in the country. Some aspects of the western culture invaded Sri
Lanka through the behaviour of those who went to western countries for education.
More Europeans were attracted to Sri Lanka during the 19th century because of the
expansion of plantations, development of trade and the improvements of transport
and communication that took place in the country. As a result their clubs, holiday
resorts started to mushroom in the country accelerating the spreading of western
culture. As a result of these western dresses, customs and traditions, greetings,
western architecture and their food started to mix into the culture of Sri Lanka.

The Sri Lankan culture experienced heavy changes during the British reign parallel
to the changes in the society. The most significant change was the spreading of
western culture in the country. The western education and studying of English
language began to spread fast in the country after the Colebrooke reforms. It was
the foreigners that prepared the curricula and conducted teaching in missionary
schools and state aided schools. These schools too paved the way for the spreading
of western culture in the country. Some aspects of the western culture invaded Sri
Lanka through the behaviour of those who went to western countries for education.
More Europeans were attracted to Sri Lanka during the 19th century because of the
expansion of plantations, development of trade and the improvements of transport
and communication that took place in the country. As a result their clubs, holiday
resorts started to mushroom in the country accelerating the spreading of western
culture. As a result of these western dresses, customs and traditions, greetings,
western architecture and their food started to mix into the culture of Sri Lanka.

List out the new things that entered the Sri Lankan culture during the British
reign.
5.3 Advantages of the British Reign
When Sri Lanka was a colony of British, its political and economic activities were
handled in a way that all benefits went to colonists. Thus, Sri Lanka had been
exploited for 133 years by the British. During this time they earned a vast wealth
from the island to take to their country and used all resources of the island for their
well being. Even under such conditions, there were certain benefits that the island
could enjoy. Some examples are;
• Spreading of English language in the island which was an international language
• Development of transport and communication
• Introduction of export plantation
• Good effects of industrial revolution
• Parliamentary system
5.4 Disadvantages
Though there were some advantages of being a colony of British there were many
problems by the time Sri Lanka received independence after being exploited for
133 years by a foreign empire. Although some citizens became wealthy during
this period the majority of the people were touching the depth of poverty when
independence was won. Thus, there was a vast disparity in distribution of income
and an immediate need had arisen to increase public service and welfare. Some
more disadvantages of staying a colony are;
• spreading of western culture and deterioration of indigenous culture
• spreading of alcohol consumption
• emergence of a landless social group
• downfall of self sufficient economic system and losing of indigenous knowledge
• destruction of useful institutions such as village councils (Gamsabha)

C H A P T E R
Receiving of Independence
to Sri Lanka
Introduction
Receiving of independence to Sri Lanka in 1948 is a historical landmark in our
country. At the same time Sri Lanka got the parliamentary system allowing its people
to join politics through the representative democracy. New changes occurred in the
political system with the introduction of new constitutions in 1972 and 1978. This
lesson focuses on the special features of the political system and the trends in the
social and economic systems during the few decades after independence.
6.1 Soulbury Reforms and Independence
The members of the Soulbury Commission that was appointed to investigate
into Sri Lanka’s constitutional reforms and give proposals came to Sri Lanka in
December 1944. They published their report in September, 1945 and a constitution
that would give all powers of internal affairs to the Sri Lankans had been suggested
in it. Britain issued the royal order of the Soulbury Constitution in May, 1946
after the State Council passed the white paper which included the proposals of
the Soulbury Commission report. Though the first election to be held under the
Soulbury constitution was scheduled in mid 1947, Britain was reluctant to issue any
statement about Sri Lanka’s independence. Because of that the Sri Lankan leaders
like D.S. Senanayake logically presented their views on the right of Sri Lankans
for independence, to the British. As a result, the secretary of colonies made an
announcement two months before the election, declaring independence for Sri
Lanka within the Commonwealth Nations. By this time, the United National Party
had been established by Mr. D.S. Senanayake. The results of the 1947 parliamentary
election are given below.

Mr. D.S. Senanayake who was able to win the support of many independent members
was able to establish the government because the United National Party won the
majority of the seats. Though the British government was willing to hand over the
responsibility of internal affairs to the Sri Lankans, they tried to keep foreign affairs
in the hands of the British continuously. The reason for that was because they did
not like to break the connection with the island as its geographical location was
very important in military and security purposes. The new Prime Minister, D.S.
Senanayake understood this intention and signed two agreements on security and
external affairs with the British government in November, 1947.
Under the defence convention, it was agreed that the British could use Sri Lankan
territory for naval, air and other military purposes when necessary. Under the
external affairs convention, the British agreed to provide Sri Lanka with necessary
assistance in building relationships with other countries as an independent country.
After that the Independence Act of Sri Lanka was passed in the British parliament
including the statements to grant independence to Sri Lanka. The royal order on
the independence of Sri Lanka including statements to put the act into operation
was issued on the 19th of December 1947. Sri Lanka received independence again
on the 4th of February, 1948 with those formalities coming into function. With that
the power the British enjoyed to impose laws and to govern the country ended and
those powers were handed over to the Sri Lankan government. The new parliament
 Soulbury Constitution
The Soulbury constitution came into action after the Donoughmore constitution
that functioned from 1931-1947. It lasted till the Republican constitution of 1972
came into action. The Soulbury constitution introduced four institutions for the
functioning of the government as, the governor general and the cabinet of ministers
headed by the prime minister, the parliament and the judiciary.
 The Governor General
The post of governor which existed up to 1947 was discontinued and a governor
general was appointed to represent the British throne even under the new
constitution, the queen of Britain was accepted as the ruler of Sri Lanka and the
governor general acted as the local representative of the queen. The post of the
governor general was completely a nominal executive post and had to take advice of
the prime minister in all situations.
 The Parliament
Under the Soulbury constitution, there was a legislature which consisted of a senate
and a court of members of parliament. The court of members or the representative
members consisted of 101 members. Out of them 95 were elected from the electorate
system and the other 6 were appointed by the governor with the advice of the prime
minister to represent the minorities who are not represented in the parliament. The
duration of the parliament was 5 years.
There were 30 members to the second court of members which was called the senate.
The representative court appointed 15 of them and the other 15 were appointed by
the governor general according to the advice of the prime minister.
 The Prime Minister and the Cabinet

- 81 -
the member who could win the support of the majority of the members in the
representative court of the parliament as the prime minister. The cabinet of ministers
held the executive powers in this constitution. Defence and foreign affairs were
under the prime minister. The cabinet of ministers was appointed by the governor
general according to the advice of the prime minister.
The minister of justice and one more portfolio should be given to the senate.
According to the Westminster System, the cabinet of ministers was collectively
responsible to the parliament.
 The Judiciary
According to the Soulbury Constitution, the judiciary was functioned by courts
including the Supreme Court. The governor general appointed the Chief Justice
and other Supreme Court judges. The administration of court judges were done by
the Judiciary Service Commission headed by the Chief Justice.
 Political Party System in Sri Lanka
Political party system can be seen in all countries where the parliamentary democracy
exists. There were only two major parties in countries like England and America at
the beginning. This is called as dual-party system. In European countries such as
France, Germany as well as the Asian countries such as India, Sri Lanka several
political parties can be seen. This system is called as the multi-party system.
Because of the political party system, it has become easy to organize people under
the principles of each party and to pass their opinion among people. The party
system is necessary to build the relationship between politicians and voters because
the parliamentary system is an administration in which a country is governed by the
representatives of people.
The political party system in Sri Lanka began during the British reign. Though the
universal franchise was given to Sri Lanka in 1937, until 1947, the political party
system was not considered in elections. The political party system came into action
in Sri Lanka in the election of 1947. By that election, political parties such as Lanka
Sama Samaja Party, United National Party, Lanka Communist Party and Tamil
Congress were functioning.
 Lanka Sama Samaja Party
The Lanka Sama Samaja Party is considered as one of the oldest parties in Sri Lanka.
The leaders like Dr. N.M. Perera, Dr. Kolvin R. de Silva, Mr. Philip Gunawardana
who went abroad for education learnt about leftist politics in those countries and
established the Lanka Sama Samaja Party in Sri Lanka in 1935 to implement such
politics in a way suitable to Sri Lanka. The prime objective of the Lanka Sama
Samaja Party was to create a communist society in Sri Lanka according to the
doctrine of leftist political points of view. Later a fraction of the Lanka Sama Samaja
Party headed by Dr. S. A. Wickramasinghe established the Lanka Communist Party
in 1943.
 United National Party
Though by 1946, there were several leftist parties and minority parties, there was
no party for the politicians who had neutral ideas. The United National Party
was started in 1946 under the leadership of Mr. D.S. Senanayake because the first
parliamentary election was scheduled in 1947. The majority of the members of the
Lanka National Congress and the Sinhala Maha Sabha headed by Mr. S. W. R. D.
Bandaranayake joined the United National Party. As a result, it became a powerful
political party from the beginning. They were able to win 42 seats by presenting 95
contesters. They were able to establish a government in1952 by winning 54 seats in
the second parliamentary election.
 Sri Lanka Freedom Party
Mr. S. W. R. D. Bandaranayake broke away from the United National Party and
established Sri Lanka Freedom Party in 1951. This party paid more attention on
the necessities of general public than the UNP and was able to win the support
of the vernacular scholars, monks and those who valued nationalism. The party
that won only 9 seats in the 1951 parliamentary election contested as the Mahajana
Eksath Peramuna by aligning with several other parties and was able to establish
the government in 1956 election by securing 51 seats. Mr. Bandaranayake was
the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka from 1956 to 1959. After the assassination of Mr.
Bandaranayake, his wife Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranayake became the leader of the
party.

The leaders like Dr. N.M. Perera, Dr. Kolvin R. de Silva, Mr. Philip Gunawardana

established Sri Lanka Freedom Party in 1951. This party paid more attention on
the necessities of general public than the UNP and was able to win the support
of the vernacular scholars, monks and those who valued nationalism. The party
that won only 9 seats in the 1951 parliamentary election contested as the Mahajana
Eksath Peramuna by aligning with several other parties and was able to establish
the government in 1956 election by securing 51 seats. Mr. Bandaranayake was
the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka from 1956 to 1959. After the assassination of Mr.
Bandaranayake, his wife Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranayake became the leader of the
party.
- 83 -
 Other Political Parties
Other than the above parties that presented candidates around the country in
elections, there were several parties which were in function. The Labour Party
pioneered by Mr. A. E. Gunasinghe and the Tamil Congress started by Mr. G. G.
Ponnambalam are some examples for such parties. Among them the Tamil Congress
held a significant place until the 1956 election. They who paid special attention on
the rights of the Tamil people in this country were able to secure 07 seats in the
1947 election. It seems that the Tamil Congress lost its public support when Mr. J. V.
Chelvanayagam started the Federal Party in 1949.
According to the political party system that exists in Sri Lanka there are a number
of minor parties other than the two major parties like United National Party and Sri
Lanka Freedom Party. Because of that, there can be situations in which no party can
claim a majority in an election. As a result several parties have to come together and
make political aligns to establish a coalitional government.
 1956 Election and the Social Change
The United National Party which was in power continuously after the independence
was defeated in 1956 and a new government was established under the leadership
of S.W. R.D. Bandaranayake. It is believed that a social revolution was made by that
government because several new forces were rallied round Mr. Bandaranayake to
follow a policy of valuing the native language, religion and culture and to attempt to
solve some unresolved social and economic problems.
Because Mr. D.S. Senanayake who became the Prime Minister in the 1947 election
died in March, 1952, his son Dudley Senanayake became the Prime Minister.
He became the Prime Minister again in 1952 because the United National Party
won that election too. But he resigned from his portfolio in 1953 because of the
remonstrations that were staged by the leftist parties in protest of rising price of
rice and other food items. Then, another senior member of United National Party,
Mr. John Kothalawala became the Prime Minister. Though the next parliamentary
election was scheduled in May 1957, the Governor General dissolved the parliament
in February 1956 as instructed by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Kothalawala. As a
result there was another election in the country.
In the 1956 election, the United National Party contested as a single party where
- 84 -
as Sri Lanka Freedom party contested as Mahajana Eksath Peramuna aligning in
with several other parties. The Sri Lanka Freedom party, Revolutionary Socialist
Party headed by Mr. Philip Gunawardane, Mr. Vijayananda Dahanayake’s Language
Congress and several independent candidates including Mr. I. M. R. A. Eeriyagolla
came together in forming the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna. The Mahajana Eksath
Peramuna had entered into a no contest agreement with the Lanka Sama Samaja
Party and it became advantageous for both the parties.
The major issue discussed in the 1956 election stage was the policy of making Sinhala
the official language. Even after obtaining independence, English language held a
special position and it became problematic for the vernacular scholars. Because of
that, those who rallied round the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna had already accepted
Sinhala naming as the state language as a policy. The United National Party too
agreed with this policy when the election came at hand.
The Mahajana Eksath Peramuna won the election easily because of the support of
the Pancha Maha Balavega; monks , doctors , teachers , farmers and labourers were
with them. At the same time, fighting as an align signing a no contest agreement with
the leftist parties further helped them to win. They secured 51 seats and the Lanka
Sama Samaja Party got 14 seats. The United National Party won 8 parliamentary
seats only. The Federal Party won 10 seats.
With the victory of Mahajana Eksath Peramuna, Mr. S. W. R. D. Bandaranayake
became the Prime Minister. His time marked significant changes in the country.
Some of his policies and introduced reforms are;
• Making Sinhala the state language
• Discontinuation of the defence and external affairs conventions signed in 1947
with the British
• A non-alliance foreign affairs policy
Peoplizing the harbour and transport (buses )
• Development of local industries and agriculture
• Upgrading the Vidyodaya and Vidyalankara pirivenas to universities with a
view of developing the higher education
- 85 -
Fig 6.1 The Cabinet of Ministers of Mr. Bandaranayake
Mr. Bandaranayake’s campaign paved the way for many leaders who emerged from
the general public of the country to enter the parliament. During his administration,
the policy that valued the nationality and the attempt to solve the unsolved problems
of the general public were significant landmarks.
 Sri Lanka becoming a Republic in 1972
The Soulbury constitution continued from 1948–1972 in the country. The
independence Sri Lanka received under this constitution was not complete because
still the queen of Britain was considered the leader of the country and there were
certain restrictions for the parliament to follow in imposing laws. As a result, the
necessity of a new constitution was felt during the time of the Soulbury Commission.
A successful attempt was made for that with the 1970 election.
A united align had been established to face the 1970 election by the Sri Lanka
Freedom Party, the Lanka Sama Samaja party and the Communist Party. They
signed a treaty of understanding to contest in the election. They had requested a
people's verdict for the winners to work as a constitutional council to design a new
constitution. The Samagi Peramuna (United Alliance) that won the majority of seats
in the election established a new government. Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike became
the Prime Minister. They introduced a new constitution on 22nd May 1972 working
according to the people's verdict. It's named as the 1972 Constitution.
- 86 -
Basic characteristics of the 1972 constitution
• The name ‘Ceylon’ was changed to ‘ Sri Lanka
• Discontinuation of the constitutional bond that existed with Britain with
territorial integrity
• Acceptance of Sri Lanka as a unitary republic
• Protection of basic human rights
 Fundmental Rights
The statement 18 of the 1972 constitution mentions the following as some basic
human rights and the comprehensive freedom.
• Functioning of law , the protection of law and other legal affairs should be
completely impartial.
• A person’s life, freedom or protection should not be harmed if otherwise the law.
• Every person has the right to enjoy free thinking, conscience and religion.
• Citizens have freedom for peaceful gathering and expressing their opinions.
Acceptance of basic human rights in the constitution was a special characteristic.
 The President
Instead of the post of governor general of the Soulbury
Commission, the new constitution introduced the post
of nominal executive president. The prime minister
enjoyed the power of appointing the president. The
president had the same power enjoyed by the governor
general. The then Governor General, Mr. William
Gopallawa became
first nominal executive
president of Sri Lanka.
Fig 6.2 Mr. William Gopallawa, the first

consultancy board and a judiciary service disciplinary board were established to
protect the sovereignty of the judiciary. The labour courts functioned under these
boards.
The Constitutional court had been established to settle the problems about
constitution and to observe whether the bills presented to parliament agree with the
constitution.
 New Constitution in 1978
The United National Party was able to win 140 out of 168 seats of the National State
Council in the election held in 1977. The Tamil Liberation Front secured 18 seats in
this election where as the Sri Lanka Freedom Party could win only 8 seats. In
addition, the Ceylon Workers’ Congress and an independent
party won a seat. As the United National Party could
obtain more than a two third majority, its leader, Mr. J. R.
Jayewardene was able to design a new constitution with an
executive presidency as he expected for a long time. This
constitution came into effect since 1978.

system. This method is used in all elections including parliamentary, provincial
council and the other local government elections.
Candidates face this type of elections in groups. The number of members elected for
each electorate is announced before the election and the voters have to first vote for
the party and mark the preferences for the candidates. The number of seats for each
party is determined according to the proportion of votes they take and candidates
are selected following the number of preference votes they get.
 Referendum
Referendum is a way of getting the people's opinion directly on matters with national
importance. The concept of referendum was first introduced in 1978 constitution.
Here, the people’s discretion is marked by answering a “yes or no” question. The
only referendum of the history of Sri Lanka was held in 1982. It was held to get the
period of existing parliament extended.
There should be more than 50% of the cast votes to declare that the people have
given their consent to the matter on discussion.
6.2 Development after Independence
After the independence in 1948 politicians of this country had the responsibility
of handling the economy of the country that had been used for the benefit of the
British colonists for the betterment of the people. During the four decades after the
independence , the two major parties of Sri Lanka , the United National Party and
the Sri Lanka Freedom Party were in power and they tried to develop the economy
of Sri Lanka. They had tried several ways to develop the agriculture , industries and
the education of the country.
- 93 -
 Development of Agriculture
The food needed for the people was produced within the country because Sri Lanka
had been an agricultural country from the past. Yet, the British administration that
lasted for 133 years paid attention to state plantation and did not pay enough
attention to the local agriculture. The English imported the necessary food items to
Sri Lanka during their reign. As a result, by the time Sri Lanka got the independence,
a need had arisen to develop the production of food items within the country. Hence,
every government had to take steps to develop paddy cultivation.
 Development of Paddy Cultivation
Towards the latter part of the British reign in Sri Lanka, they had to pay attention to
developing the agriculture in Sri Lanka because of the difficulty of exporting food
due to the World War 1 and increasing food prices due to the economic demise in
1929. Yet the most productive attempt was made during the period of the State
Council (1931–1947). The reasons for the development of the paddy cultivation
during that era were appointing a Sri Lankan minister for the ministry of agriculture
under the Donoughmore constitution and Mr. D. S. Senanayake who had an interest
to develop the agriculture becoming the Minister of Agriculture.
The flat and rich soil that was more suitable for paddy cultivation exists in the dry
zone of the country and therefore , that area should be used for paddy cultivation
again. Therefore Mr. D. S. Senanayake started establishing farming settlements in
the dry zone.
 Establishment of Farming Settlements
Objectives of establishing farming settlements:
• Reducing the increasing population and unemployment in the wet zone.
• Improving the food production of the country.
• Using the land of the dry zone for economic development by repairing the old
lakes and irrigations of the dry zone.
• Providing a solution to the competition for the land in wet zone and creating a
satisfied landed farming community.
- 94 -
Sri Lanka became self – sufficient with paddy because a vast era of the dry zone
was used for paddy cultivation. As a solution to the major problem that arose in the
area, lack of water, our ancestors built a network of lakes and irrigations. But , after
the invasion of Kalinga Magha people had immigrated to the wet zone from the dry
zone. Using thus given up dry zone again for paddy cultivation after 700 years was
a landmark of the development of paddy cultivation in Sri Lanka.
Challenges the government faced in establishing new farming settlements:
• Selecting people from the wet zone and making them settle in houses in the dry
zone.
• Supporting people to turn the lands that had been forests for a long time into
farm land and supplying irrigation facilities.
• Providing the settlers with financial assistance till they get their first harvest.
• Arranging health and education facilities for people.
• Establishment of sales promotion programmes for the sale of products.
Several farming settlements could be started even before independence because
there were effective plans to lay out necessary rules to overcome the difficulties.
Some examples for such settlements were Kagama, Minneriya, Nachchaduwa,
Beragama, Minipe, Parakrama Samudraya, Ridi Bedi Ella, Sangili Kanadarawa and
Onichchei. After independence till about 1953, 15 more farming settlements were
established. Bathmadika, Deva Huwa, Girithale, Paniyankadawala, Iranamadu, Gal
Oya, Kantale, Soraborawewa were such settlements.
With these new farming settlements there was great enthusiasm in the country to
reconstruct lakes and building of irrigation. Galoya project is an example for that. It
is the first multi-purpose development project started in Sri Lanka.
 Mahaweli Project
The Mahaweli project takes an important place among the projects launched
targeting the economic development of the country after the independence. The
Mahaweli river that is fed by several tributaries begins in the western part of the
central hills , flows across the Dumbara valley and joins sea at Trincomalee. The
Mahawali development project was launched with a view of using this web of rivers
for the economic development of the country.
- 95 -
Map 6.1 Farming Settlements
- 96 -
Some objectives of the Mahaweli project:
• Continuous water supply to the dry zone farm lands for productive agricultural
work.
• Production of electricity to cover the increasing demand for electricity.
• Creating more settlements through water supply and the expansion of cultivation
of food by providing the landless people with lands.
Other than these main objectives there were other objectives such as generating
jobs and agricultural opportunities, controlling flood, breeding fresh water fish etc.
Thus, the Mahaweli project became a multi-purpose project.
The first stage of the Mahaweli project was to build a dam at Pollgolla across the
Mahaweli river to take water to Sudu Ganga and take that water to the dry zone via
Bovathenna reservoir. There were further plans to take water from this part to Kala
Wewa, Nachchaduwa Wewa, Nuwara Wewa, Thisa wewa and several other lakes.
This project was
started in 1970
and the expected
covered by 1977.
Several
other
reservoirs, dams
and canals had
been planned to
be built under
the Mahaweli
project.
first plan was to
complete
in 30 years.
Fig 6.5 Polgolla dam
Mr. J.R. Jayewardene’s government which came into power in 1977 decided to
complete this in 6 years and prepared an speedy plan of work. Therefore , instead
of the Mahaweli Development Board that existed, the Ministry of Mahaweli
Development was established in 1978 and Mr. Gamini Dissanayake was appointed
the minister. The Mahaweli authority was established in 1979 because the necessity
of an authority with high power was felt for the functioning of the Mahaweli project.
- 97 -
Steps were taken to build reservoirs such as Kothmale, Victoria, Randenigala,
Rantambe, Ulhitiya, Rathkinda, Madru Oya; dams such as Minipe and some water
turning centres.
Victoria Reservoir
This vast reservoir was made by building a
dam, a little lower to the Polgolla dam. One
of the main objectives of building this dam
was generating hydro–electricity. The British
government provided aids for this project.
Kothmale Reservoir
The Kothmale reservoir was made by building
a dam at Kadadora across Kothmale Oya
which is one of the main tributaries of the
Mahaweli river. The Sweden government
provided aids for this.
Randenigala Reservoir
The Randenigala reservoir was built a little
lower to the Victoria reservoir and above the
Minipe dam. The production of electricity
and supplying water for irrigations were the
expected outcomes. West Germany provided
financial aids for this.

By storing Mahaweli water in reservoirs, The production of hydro – electricity ,
supplying water for both cultivated and yet to cultivate lands in the dry zone
became possible. In addition to the production of electricity and providing water for
agriculture , it made settlement of people, building of new cities and roads possible
under this project.

- 99 -
Other steps that that were taken to develop paddy cultivation:
• Introduction of a certified price for paddy in 1948
• Establishment of paddy research institution and introduction of new paddy
species. An example is Bathalegoda paddy breeding centre.
• Establishment of farming service centres (Govijana Sewa Centres)
• Giving loans to farmers through state banks.
 Cultivation for Commercial Purpose
The products that were related to the traditional coconut plantation, tea and
rubber introduced by the British existed as the major export products for about
three decades after obtaining independence. Several steps have been taken for the
development of those crops after 1948. Some such steps were;
• Declaring a limited area of land that can be kept in possession of one person by
the land rehabilitation law of 1972. Thus, the area of land that can be kept for one
person were 10 hectares (25 acres) for paddy cultivation and 20 hectares (50 acres)
for other cultivations.
• The lands of the commercial plantation companies were peopolized by the 1975
land reforms. Because of these reforms about 62% of the land that belonged to those
mega scale plantation companies was given to the government. As 10% of the state
lands were distributed among farmers as small pieces of land, a group of small scale
land owners was created.
The ownership of mega scale lands shifted from the private sector to the government
by the 1975 land reforms.
Several institutions were established after gaining independence for the management
of state lands.
• State Plantation Cooperation established in 1958.
• Upcountry Estate Development Bureau established in 1976.
• People’s Estate Development Bureau established in 1976.
- 100 -
Sri Lanka could export rubber products to China as a result of the bilateral
convention signed between the two countries in 1952. So there was a stable market
for rubber products of the country.
The government started a new project of giving aids to the landowners for re-
plantation of rubber in 1977. There, rubber plants and fertilizers were given. Later,
this was extended to tea plantation too.
A special feature is the emergence of a group of small scale landowners as a result of
the distribution of land continued by the government after gaining independence.
As a result, a group of landowners who owned lands between 1-10 acres of tea and
rubber emerged in the Western, Southern and Sabaragamuwa provinces. With this
the income of villagers in relation to major export crops increased.
 Development of Small Scale Export Crops
Steps were taken after gaining independence to develop the small scale export crops
such as; coffee, cocoa, cardamom, cloves, nutmeg, pepper, cinnamon in addition to
the major crops such as tea, rubber and coconut.
In 1968, according to the Tea Commission reports cultivation of some minor scale
export crops was encouraged as additional cultivations.
A minor scale export research institution was started in Matale in 1972. Similar
institutions were later started in areas like Kundasale, Delpitiya, Narammala.
Some more steps were taken to expand the cultivation of small scale crops since
1972. Giving advice on cultivation, provision of fertilizers and sales promotion are
some examples for them.
 Policy of Industrialization
No development took place in the industrial sector of Sri Lanka during the British
administration because they used Sri Lanka as a market where they could sell their
products. Some attention was paid on the industrial sector when labour industries
- 101 -
and trade ministries were given to Sri Lankans under Donoughmore reforms. The
Sri Lanka Bank Commission that investigated into the status of the Sri Lankan
industries in 1934 had recommended starting industries to provide industrial
products to the local market.
There were problems in exporting goods to Sri Lanka during the World War II
which began in 1939. Products like acetic acid, porcelain products, paper, soup and
perfumes were produced and they had good demand. Those industries suffered
drawbacks because they were unable to compete with the exported products that
began to flow back to Sri Lanka after World War II.
A group of World Bank representatives that came to Sri Lanka in 1952 pointed out
the importance of starting small scale industries with the help of the government.
There was enthusiasm to invest money on industries because the government
made their policy on foreign and private investment clear in the 1955 white paper
which was issued after the report of the World Bank representatives. After that,
the establishment of the first industrial zone in Ekala in 1959 and the Ratmalana
industrial zone in 1960 became the landmarks in the policy of industrialization.
Some Landmarks of the Industrial Field after 1960:
• Establishment of People’s Bank in 1961 and providing the small scale industrialists
with loan facilities.
• Establishment of a standard bureau to decide the standard of local industrial
products in 1966.
• Development of industries that produced local consumer goods due to the
government industrial policy after 1960.
• Development of local home industries and minor scale industries due to the
export substitution policy of the government during 1970–1977.
Export substitution policy means producing alternative local products instead of
the products that were exported.
• The government started to continue mega scale industries in vast factories that
used raw materials in mega scale in the three decades after obtaining
independence. Some examples for such industries are cement, iron and steel,
sugar and plywood.
• After 1977 there was a rapid development in export related industries such as
garment industry because of the policies followed to attract foreign investors and to
encourage the private sector to develop export related industries. The establishment
of Mega Colombo Economic Commission in 1978, establishment of export
preparation zone at Katunayake in the same year, later the establishment of such
zones in Biyagama and Koggala helped the development of the industrial sector.
 Education
A steady development occurred in the education of the island during the British
administration. The number of schools in the country rapidly increased because
there arose a desire for education in the minds of Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim
people during the religious and national renaissance. The children of the poor
could enjoy little benefits of education because of the financial difficulties they
had when pursuing higher education. Because of this free education policy which
provided free education from grade 1 to university was launched as proposed by Mr.
C.W.W. Kannangara who was the Minister of Education in the State Council. Every
government that came to power after that, continued the free education policy.
Some landmarks of education after 1948 are given below;
• Increasing the number of schools around the country by establishing government
schools and spending money on education project
• Curriculum development and renovations in teacher training
• Expansion of laboratory and library facilities
• Free supply of textbooks, lunch, medical and dental care services,
school uniforms and the improvement of student welfare and support through
concessionary transport facilities
• Timely changes in education administration
Expansion of professional education
• Improvement of higher education by establishing new universities
• Establishment of Ceylon University in 1942 in Colombo
• Shifting the Ceylon University to Peradeniya in 1952
• Transforming the Vidyodaya and Vidyalankara pirivenas to universities.
Later, they were named as Sri Jayawardanapura University and Kelaniya
• Establishment of Moratuwa Katubedda University in 1972 and Jaffna University
University respectively.

6.3 Social Welfare
Even the very poor people received a political value because Sri Lanka got the
universal franchise in 1931. Politicians started looking into the necessities of the
general public because it became a major factor in capturing political power. There
had been several social problems that affected the lives of the general public badly
due to the fact that Sri Lanka had been a colony for a long time. A significant feature
in the government policy was to bring back social justice and annihilate inequality
by providing solutions to the long lasting social problems. Some examples for the
projects that were launched to bring back social justice after 1948 are,
• development of education in rural areas
• giving priority to the achievements and following competitive examination
system in giving jobs
Exporting of food items became limited because of the obstacles to naval transport
due to World War II. The government started giving food concessions because of
this. The government had to continue these concessions as a way of minimizing
poverty because people had got accustomed to welfare facilities, and the lack of land
and less productivity. Here, priority was given to rice concession. A coupon book
was issued to everybody to make the rice concession more systematic. It was called
as ‘Hal Potha –Rice Book’. A system of stamps was introduced in 1977 instead of the
coupon book.
Another problem those poor people faced was the problem of shelter. Several
programmes were launched after independence to solve the problem of shelter in
rural and city areas. The government took steps to build flats and housing complexes
in city areas and gave aids to rural area people to build houses under different
housing projects. Sri Lanka was able to achieve a number of victories by launching
• constitutionalizing of concepts such as; freedom, sovereignty and fundamental
different welfare projects after gaining independence.
rights
• provision of government support to agriculture and fisheries industry through
loan schemes and concessionaries
 Health Service
Though free health facilities were available in Sri Lanka even before independence,
they were limited to city areas. So, special attention was paid on developing health
facilities in rural areas after gaining independence. Some examples for the steps taken
to improve rural health facilities are establishment of rural hospitals, development
of midwifery, maternity and paediatric health services, immunization, conducting
medical clinics and improving indigenous medicine etc. As a result, the number
that suffered from diseases such as; influenza, phylaria, malaria, tuberculosis, polio
went down dramatically.
 Other Welfare Facilities
Travel and transport of the country developed during the British rule because they
built roads and railways. After the independence, rural roads were developed so that
the benefits of the above mentioned transport facilities trickled down to the villages
also. As a result, the distance between the village and the city shortened and the
facilities that were limited to the cities such as water, electricity and communication
reached the villages too.

C H A P T E R
Significant Revolutions
in the World
Introduction
The word ‘revolution’ stands for a significant change that occurs in a particular field
within a short period of time. Such a change occurred in the industrial sector is
called as the industrial revolution. The change that occurred during the religious
renaissance in Europe is called as the religious renaissance. There had been several
such revolutions in the political field also. The struggle for freedom in America
or the American revolution, the French revolution and the Russian revolution are
examples for such revolutions. This lesson gives more details about such political
revolutions.
7.1 Independence Struggle in America
 Introduction
The struggle that was staged in order to obtain independence from the British
empire by the American state citizens is called as the American independence
struggle. Five years after Christopher Columbus landed in the Bahamas islands in
the Caribbean sea, Amerigo Wespucci found the vast mass of land that belongs to
the American continent. After that a German geologist used the name ‘America’ to
call that area. Columbus after coming to this American region believed that he came
to India. Therefore, he called the natives of that country as Indians. The natives who
lived in the northern part of America were called the Red Indians going by their
complexion. The Europeans who heard about America which was a huge country
full of natural resources started colonizing it in groups. Portugal, Spain, Holland,
France and Britain are some European countries that established states in America.
There are several reasons that affected the establishment of states in America; they
• europeans started searching for new areas where there was more religious
freedom because there were fights between Roman Catholics and Protestants.
• aim of a prosperous life by capturing land in new areas for trade.
the encouragement and enthusiasm given by the rulers of European countries
for searching new areas and establishing colonies to enrich their wealth and
glory.
 Colonization by the British
Several European nations colonized America during the one and half centuries after
Columbus landed in America. There, the Portuguese and the Spanish colonized
the southern part and the British and the French colonized the northern part of
America. With the colonies being established by the British in Northern America,
United States of America was built.

The colonization in North America that began with the establishment of Virginia
State in 1607 by the British continued for about a century. A significant characteristic
is the interference of individuals, groups of people and companies rather than the
direct influence of the British government in the colonization of America. The
British government gave its approval and assistance in colonization. The British who
went to Northern America had established thirteen estates by 1733. Their names are
given above.
Twelve estates out of those thirteen were started between 1607 and 1682. The last
British colony among those thirteen was Georgia. It was established in 1733. The
nature of the first states shows that they were not started at the same time. The
reasons for their start were also different. One reason for the establishment of these
states was the expectation of religious freedom and commercial benefits. Differences
existed among these states with regard to composition of population, life style and
economic matters. Nevertheless, they began to rise as a separate English speaking
community by the mid 18th century.
 American States and the British Administration
It was mentioned above that the colonies were established in North America by
British companies and different individuals’ interference. Those who started
colonies took a warrant from the British government. There, they had to work under
several conditions. Some of them were the acceptance of the authority of the British
government and imposing the same laws that were in Britain, in the new colonies.
States were ruled by a governor appointed to each state. There was a legislative
council elected from each state to assist the governor. The state citizens followed a
local self governance system because of the long distance between the two countries
and the absence of a developed communication system. The reasons for this are
that the colonies were situated far away from the mother country and Britain could
not pay much attention to colonies as it was involved in various battles in Europe.
Hence, till about 1763 Britain followed a flexible political policy regarding American
states. This led to the development of thoughts about freedom in the minds of state
citizens. Yet, they needed the assistance of Britain because they still had to face some
problems.
The settlers of American colonies had to face two problems regarding their security
before 1763. The first was the threat of the French. The settlers of the colonies wanted
the protection of the British because the French power was there to the north of the
- 108 -
British colonies and they tried to consolidate their power. There was a war between
the British and the French between 1756 and 1763. It is called the seven year war.
France was defeated in this war. The American colonists became free of the France's
threat because Britain and France signed a treaty of peace. The main obstacle that
disturbed the expansion of the American colonies to west was the Red Indians.
When the French were powerful they had connection with the French against the
British. This situation changed with the defeat of France. After that the policies
continued by the British were able to minimize the threat of the Red Indians.
Americans no longer needed the British assistance regarding its protection because
the power of France was lost when they were defeated in the seven year war and the
Red Indians’ threat was diminished with new defence strategies.
 Reasons for the Freedom Struggle
The British economic policy and commercial activities were continued in a way that
was beneficial to Britain. Thus, it was prohibited to produce in states, things that
were produced in Britain. Apart from that, tobacco, sugar, cotton, bee vax corn,
bronze that were produced in the states should only be sold to Britain. The other
products were also allowed to export only via Britain. Further, there was a condition
that the states should not compete with Britain regarding production or trade.
Though these policies brought economic disadvantages to the people in states, they
got a stable market because of Britain. On the other hand, because the British laws
did not function too strictly in the colonies, they could engage in illegal transactions
with other nations and reduce their losses. Because of the above reasons there was
no strong protest against the British economic system and laws in American states
till about 1763. Yet, because of the new laws introduced by Britain after 1763, there
were disparities between the two countries. This generated new ideas about freedom.
Britain had to bear a huge cost in the seven year war and as a result of it their debts
increased. The British believed that the American states too should bear a part of
those debts and interest. Therefore, the British Prime Minister, George Granville
decided to systemize tax collection in the American states. He tightened the naval
patrol in order to stop illegal transactions. More tax bills were passed to increase the
income that was gained from America. Three bills that were passed between 1764
and 1765 were;
Sugar Act
Currency Note Act
Stamp Act
- 109 -
According to the Sugar Act, more British naval forces were sent to the coastal areas
resulting in fights between people and the naval officers. The Currency Note Act
prohibited issuing of currency notes by states to pay debts. As a result, the people in
states had to pay debts in gold or silver. While there were increasing protests against
these two acts by the people in states, Britain passed a Stamp Bill on 1765. According
to this act a tax was charged from all printed documents and warrants. The stamp
levy affected the high class people in American society such as traders, lawyers
and printers and they started organizing protests. There were increasing protests
against this act and the people in America refused to pay the stamp levy. People
united in organizing these protests against the levies on tea, glass, paper other than
the above mentioned taxes. In another bill passed in Britain, the American states
were ordered to provide accommodation and financial allocation for the British
forces that were placed in America. When people started protests against these acts,
Britain started to use repressive actions such as dissolving of constitutional councils
etc. Therefore, the Americans started to organize and struggle for independence.
When this situation is summarized, several reasons for the American revolution
can be identified.
 Reasons for the American Revolution
 Americans were used to a self governing system with less interference from
Britain.
 The economic policy followed by Britain which was more beneficial for Britain
itself.
 The British government’s inability to understand the expectation of those who
lived in states.
 New laws and bills passed after 1763
 Britain’s attempt to suppress the reasonable struggle of the people in states.
 The desire for freedom among the people in states.
 Struggle for Freedom
Struggles that arose against the new acts and taxes imposed by the British after 1763
kindled a desire for freedom among the people who lived in states. The strongest
protest came against the stamp levy. There, the struggle developed to refuse not only
stamps but also British products. According to the tradition in Britain those days,
the power of imposing taxes was exercised by the parliament. The people in states
believed that the British parliament had no power to impose taxes for their country
- 110 -
because no member from states represented the parliament. This idea quickly
passed over to the American states and the slogan “no member, no tax” came out.
That became the slogan of the American freedom struggle. The protests that came
out against economic matters thus became a political issue.
The British cancelled the Stamp Act because of the protests that came against it. But,
they declared that the British government had the power to impose laws regarding
the American states. The British government which understood that the Americans
were against the direct taxes like stamp levy, imposed several custom duties in 1767
in order to get their income increased. Thus, custom duties were imposed upon
items such as glass, lead, paper, tea which were imported to America. Several fights
occurred because of the attempt of Britain to obtain these taxes and the protests
were staged by the people in states against those attempts. Five people died in Boston
when the British forces fired at such a protest campaign. Because of such acts, bitter
feelings about Britain emerged in the minds of the Americans. Britain had to suffer
heavy losses than the income they got because the people in the states boycotted the
British products. Therefore, all taxes were abolished except the tax on tea in 1770.
The tax on tea continued to prove the British power to impose taxes for America
rather than to get an income.
In another bill passed in 1773, Britain gave power to one company to supply tea
to American states. This created trouble to the traditional tea sale of the American
traders. Some Americans who were furious about this decision obstructed the trade
companies to unload tea in America.
In December 1773, Boston citizens who entered under disguise a ship with tea that
had docked in Boston harbour threw 342 tea containers into the sea. This incident
which is known as the ‘Boston Tea Party’ is believed to be the beginning of the
American revolution. In reply to this, the British took steps to close down the
Boston harbour till the loss of tea was compensated. In addition to that, they took
steps to reform the administration of Massachusetts and Georgia states by imposing
laws without taking the ideas of the people into consideration. The people of states
who were angry about these submissive steps rallied to Philadelphia and conducted
a convention. This is treated as the first continental convention in the history of the
American revolution.
- 111 -
Fig 7.2 – Boston Tea Party
The Philadelphia convention was a landmark in the American freedom struggle.
It was declared that the British parliament had no authority in imposing laws for
American states, in this convention where 12 states were represented. Further
proposals were passed to boycott the British products and to make people of states
armed for their security. After this, the battle between the British government and
American states intensified. Many people died in an armed battle between the forces
of the two parties in 1775 in Lexington, America. Later the state representatives
got together in Philadelphia again and decided to organize state soldiers as a
continental force. George Washington was appointed the commander of that army.
A committee was appointed in this meeting to obtain foreign aid for the American
freedom struggle.
After setting the background to face the British forces, the united representative
bureau issued the statement of America’s independence on the 4th of July 1776.
This document exclaimed that human beings have rights from birth that cannot
be deprived of and they establish governments to protect them and declared the
independence of America. The British did not agree with this and started war against
the American states. These battles continued for several years. During the first two
years of the fights, the British forces became victorious. But, after some time they
began to fail. They had to face difficulties because they were fighting in an unknown
land, thousands of miles away from their motherland. France supported the
American forces during this war. Later Spain and Holland too joined the opposition
of Britain. As a result, the American freedom struggle became problematic for
Britain. Britain offered to have peace talks in 1783 because they had suffered losses
in several battles that took place in America. As a result America was accepted as
an independent country in the Paris Peace Pact signed in 1783. After that in 1789
Americans passed a new constitution. Thus George Washington became the first
president in America.
- 112 -
 Results of the Freedom Struggle
Thirteen states that were governed separately by Britain got together and won
independence marking a landmark in the world history. By that time, there were
several other countries, in Asian and American continents which existed as colonies
of European countries. The freedom struggle of America set an example to those
countries also. Some other results of the American revolution are;
 the birth of the independent country called United States of America
 an incident which displayed the value of independence to the whole human
 generating an enthusiasm on human rights in the world
 the first written unified constitution
7.2 French Revolution
The uprising of the French people against the monarchy of France in 1789 and the
establishment of a new ruling system is called the ‘French revolution’. As a result of
the French revolution, there emerged a great attention on human rights in France
and later it spread into the other countries in the world.
France became a country with glory in Europe by the 18th century A.D. They
had marked a significant development in foreign trade and industrialization. The
condition of the french farmers was better than the other countries. France had
become a signficant country in Europe in the aspect of intellectuals and social
customs and traditions. Yet, due to the weak administration of their rulers, there
were several political, social and economic problems in France. Louis XVI was
the most responsible character for this demise. People started struggling for their
rights based on freedom, equity and brotherhood against the corrupted ruling of
Louis XVI. People protested against the monarchy in 1789 because they were under
heavy suppression by those rulers. There were several reasons that resulted such an
environment in France.
 Political Reasons of the French Revolution
Before the revolution, it was a monarchy that existed in France. The dynasty that
governed France was called Bourbon Monarchy. Louis XIV and Louis XVI were
famous kings of that dynasty. Kings believed that the kingship was anointed on
- 113 -
them by the god. All constitutional, executive and judiciary powers were centralized
to the king. King Louis XIV who was mesmerized by this unlimited power once
exclaimed, “I am the kingdom”. He further exclaimed, “whatever anticipated by me
is lawful”. He enjoyed the power to arrest anybody with no any lawsuit and imprison
for life time. People of France bitterly criticized
this power. The king used this power to suppress
his personal and political enemies and they were
imprisoned in the prison called Bastille.
Therefore, the first attack of the French revolution
was suffered by the Bastille prison which was
a symbol of corrupted ruling system under a
monarch.
The luxurious life spent by the king was another
aspect that increased the displeasure of people.
The Versailles palace where the king lived was a
massive palace covering several acres. It was full of
ponds, flower gardens and other decorations. The
king’s luxurious life style can be understood when
his palace is seen.

Fig 7.6 – Inside the palace
Fig 7.7 – A bedroom in the palace
The relationship between the king and the people was distanced because the king
lived in an enclosed luxurious palace leading a separate life. The general public were
not allowed in the palace. Only the priests and aristocrats could enter the palace.
The king got news about the country from the aristocrats. They created a completely
distorted picture about the country.
This distancing between the king made the people's frustration grow into a
revolution.

Mary Antoinette was a very proud
woman. She had interfered in the kings
ruling, exploiting his excessive power
and weaknesses.

- 115 -
The French monarchy consisted of an advisory board headed by the king and a
bench of ministers that functioned under the above mentioned advisory board. This
monarchy was highly corrupted. The local administration that was in the hands of
the aristocrats was extremely inefficient. Therefore, the government appointed a
group of officers called “intendant” for local administration. But, the battle between
the aristocrats and new officers made people suffer because the congruence of the
administration was broken.
People did not have a chance of complaining about their problems or protesting
against the monarchy however much they had to suffer.
There was a board consisting of people’s representatives which was called “States
General Council” where the problems of the general public were discussed. Yet,
it was not summoned for 175 years. Therefore the corrupted and inefficient
administration that existed in France monarchy led to a revolution in France.
 Social Aspect of the French Revolution
By the time the revolution began there existed a feudal society in France. The feudal
system was a monarchy that was run with the help of aristocrats who had captured
land in masses.
There were three social strata as priests, aristocrats and general public other than
the royal family by the time of the revolution. Priests and aristocrats enjoyed all
the social benefits. Among the general public there were three groups as middle
class, farmers and labourers. Aristocrats and the priests were the minority whereas
general public was the majority. The middle class was a group that had earned
money by trade and other business transactions. Yet, they did not have any political
recognition.
In countries like Britain, the middle class had got political power but in France, the
middle class was disheartened because of the authoritarian power of the aristocrats.
Priests were exempted from taxes and they lived on the tax money of the general
public. They were very rich. Most of the lands in France were owned by aristocrats.
Some of the privileges enjoyed by them were;
 permission to fish and hunt in any place of the country.
 farmers were to go to the grinding mills, wine presses, bakeries owned by
- 116 -
aristocrats for their requirements and they had to pay very high charges.
 the aristocrats could collect tax from the lands of farmers.
 they were exempted from government taxes.
It was the middle class that was educated and rich in the French society. Yet they
did not have proper recognition for their status. Though they were educated, all
government posts were given to uneducated, inefficient aristocrats. Because of this
situation, there emerged a concept that one’s standard should be measured based
on their ability and wealth not on their birth. This provided the background for
the emergence of the concept of equality and it later laid the foundation for the
democracy.
Among the under privileged in France the most suffered groups were farmers. They
represented 92% of the French population. They though owned some land and
worked very hard, had to pay taxes to inefficient aristocrats, were suppressed by
heavy taxes and cost of living.
 Economic Conditions that led to the French Revolution
By the time of the revolution, the French treasury was completely bankrupt. Some
reasons for that were,
the excessive expenditure for the luxurious lives of the king and his family
unnecessary expenditure for war
France had to bear losses because of the seven year war with Britain and supporting
the American freedom struggle.
Inefficient tax system
The heavy taxes were another reason for the French revolution. The general public
of France had to pay about 60% of their income as tax. There were so many types of
taxes that made people suffer. Taille, Gabelle and Capitation are three examples for
such taxes.
 Taille – A levy charged on houses and lands of the general public. This was
different from area to area. Cities like Lion and Paris were free of this tax.
- 117 -
 Gabelle - This was charged on salt. Every adult had to buy seven pounds of
salt every year. The price of salt differed from area to area. Because of that, salt
was transported illegally from areas where salt was cheap to areas where salt
was expensive. The transportation of salt was a government monopoly and
thousands of people who transported salt illegally were imprisoned.
 Capitation – This was introduced in 1695 as a levy charged from everybody.
But when in function, the cost had to be completely borne by the general
public.
Because of the area based administration system in France, laws and taxes were
different from area to area. This situation became an obstacle to local and foreign
trade and economic development of France. The middle class people who were
engaged in trade had to pay high taxes due to these taxes, laws and regulations. It is
reported that a water vessel that carried wine from southern France to Paris had to
pay taxes at 40 places and for that purpose they had to spend additional two weeks
in addition to the cost. There was no security for the money invested by middle
class people because the state treasury was bankrupt. This was an obstacle for the
development of the middle class. The middle class expected an economic system
free from government interference. But the French monarchy failed to provide the
efficient administration on economic security expected by the middle class. Those
were the reasons for the middle class to lead the revolution.
 Philosophical Ideas that helped the Revolution
The emerging bitter feelings against the monarchy were
catalyzed by French philosophical ideas. Philosophers
like Montesquieu, Voltaire and Rousseau expressed ideas
that encouraged the revolution.
Montesquieu in his book, “The Spirit of Laws” explained
the harm in allowing one person to exercise the whole
power of a nation and stated that such a condition led
to dictatorship. Therefore, he suggested dividing power
into three institutions as legislature, parliament and
judiciary and he further explained that a dictatorship can
be avoided in such a way.
Fig 7.10 Montesquieu
Voltaire explained the importance of expressing one’s own ideas freely. He severely
criticized the monarchy and the monopoly of the church.
Rousseau presented the concept people's sovereignty
through his book called "The Social Contract". He
exclaimed that the king must work for the betterment of
people; if otherwise, the people have the rights to chase
away such rulers. His ideas became the foundation of
equality and people’s sovereignty.
On the other hand, the French soldiers who went to
support the American freedom struggle had identified
concept of freedom there and started to activate it in
France encouraging the French revolution.
Fig 7.11 Rousseau
 The Revolution
By 1789 the closest reason for the French revolution is the situation arose due to the
financial problems in France where there had been continuous protests. A reform
in taxes was necessary to settle that situation. The king had to summon the council
called, States General Council. There were problems on the agenda of the meeting
because the bureau had not met for 175 years. The representatives of aristocrats,
priests and general public were there in the council. Nevertheless, the aristocrats
demanded that they and the priests should meet as a noble board. They wanted to
get together with the priests and defeat the proposals of the lower class people. The
king also agreed to this but the lower class people disagreed. Because of this crisis
the third class which represented the general public met separately.
The third class which called themselves the National Bureau gathered in an indoor
tennis court and took oaths not to dismiss until a new constitution has been designed
for France because the king closed the hall where the aristocrats met due to their
influence. This is called the “oath in the tennis court”. The general public of France
supported that group.

The people of Paris who were fed
up of the monarchy gathered in
the city with arms. The people of
France attacked the Bastille prison
which was considered a symbol of
injustic of the French monarchy
and released the prisoners on 14th
July 1789. That was the beginning
of the French revolution.
Fig 7.12 – Attack on Bastille prison
The rebellion started in France, spread all around the country. Louise XVI could not
control this situation. As a result the king’s power was lost and both central and local
administration went into the hands of the rebels. Rebels could make the country
calm by establishing a national security force and rebel committees under the leader
called ‘Lafayette’. King Louise XVI and Queen Antoinette were trialed under the
rebels and both of them were sentenced to death.
 Results of the French Revolution
There were several changes in the political, economic and social sectors of France
due to the French revolution. Through this revolution in which people rose against
a powerful monarchy and unjust social economic system, world was gifted with
numerous experiences and examples. Some of those results are;
 the interest on fundamental human rights all over the world
The french revolutionalists published a human rights convention in 1791. It
explained that the fundamental human rights are rights that the people are born
with and not something that is given by the rulers. Some concepts mentioned in the
convention are;
 every human being should have equal rights because everybody is born a free
individual.
 every citizen has a right to be a part of imposing law.
 every citizen should have the right to express their ideas freely and follow
any religion they like.
- 120 -
The three concepts; freedom, equality and brotherhood which were the main
slogans of the French revolution had high regard in the three quotations of the
above mentioned human rights convention. People who were suppressed around
the world by social inequality were blessed with this. As a result many countries in
the world later legalized the fundamental human rights in their constitution.
There were so many changes in France due to the French revolution. They can be
considered as results of the revolution. Some such changes are;
downfall of the French monarchy
relief for French farmers and labourers
instability of political states in France
Governments changed in quick succession after the revolution because those who
led the revolution had different political views. This situation lasted from 1789
to1799. Because of this unstable political situation, Napoleon Bonaparte, an army
officer captured power in France in 1799. After that, it was a completely new political
system that existed in France.

7.3 Russian Revolution
Russia was an empire which covered almost one sixth of the world land by the 20th
century. A systematic organization was needed to govern this huge empire. The
rulers in Russia those days carried out a stern administration with the help of army
forces, police and intelligence services. The deism of the Christian church helped
this administration a lot. Under this condition the rulers of Russia, Tsars worked
like dictators. Majority farmers, and the labour class created as a result of the
industrial development were under the hard grip of the church and aristocrats due
to the feudal social system that existed in Russia. People had to suffer a lot because
Russia too took part in World War I. Because of that the theme of the revolution
was; peace, land and food. Two revolutions occurred under these themes in March
- 121 -
and October 1917. Let’s now probe deep into this revolution which developed with
the purpose of creating a society with no class boundaries.
 Reasons for the Revolution
By the 20th century in Russia as well as in France, a corrupted dictating monarchy
existed. Tsars who became the kings of Russia worked according to anointed kingship.
They believed that kingship was granted to them by god and led a corrupted ruling
system paying attention only to their needs. People were made to suffer by charging
taxes in order to increase the income of the government. The kings who followed
the anointed kingship paid more attention to religion without trying to solve the
economic and social problems of the people.
When the economic and social system of Russia was considered, it seemed that
there existed an agricultural economic system based on a feudal social system. Land
was inherited by aristocrats. Farmers who were the general public of the country,
farmers had to work like slaves. Aristocrats were the rich and slaves were considered
a part of their wealth. Farmers had to suffer a lot because they had to pay a part
of their harvest earned by cultivating the land of aristocrats as tax to the church,
government and aristocrats. A labour community had emerged as a result of the
industrialization that spread in Russia by the 19th century. Anyway, their condition
was better than that of farmers. But they were a small minority. The middle class was
also a minority and most of them were government servants. While this situation
was existing in Russia they lost the war with Japan in 1904 and 1905. It was one of
the closest reasons to rise a rebellion against the government in 1905. This rebellion
against the government that was started as farmers’ rebellions and labour strikes
was joined by the rebels of the navy. Though the rebels could not win this fight, it
became a good omen for a struggle against the government.
Though Tsars made some political reforms understanding that people were rising
against the government, people were not satisfied with that and started launching
struggles again. There the king ignored the protests and started repressing people.
Because of that, the Bolshevik party which was led by Lenin, the leader of rebels
stepped out of the council called Duma and started to function secretly. At the same
time, World War I was started in 1914. Russia too joined in it as a part of allied
forces. Russia had to suffer great losses due to the war. There, Russian farmers and
labourers were recruited in the army in masses. It was done against their consent.
As a result, farming was disturbed because there were no experienced farmers.
The production of necessary items such as food, medicine, manure was disturbed
because a majority of the factories were used for armament production. Because
of that, there was a shortage of food in the country and food prices increased a lot.
People suffered a lot because the price of bread went up. People were under pressure
owing to the above reasons. It blasted in 1917.
 Revolution in March, 1917
The March revolution in 1917 began with a strike in a textile factory. It grew into a
mega strike within three days. All underprivileged groups gathered in this. People
protested along roads demanding for bread. Even the soldiers in Tsar’s government
joined these protests. The king had to give up his throne in March 1917 because he
could not control people’s protests. After this, the administration power was taken
by a group of rebels led by a leader called Kerensky. They too did not have solutions
to the problems of the country.
The necessity of the country by that time was land for farmers, peace for soldiers and
food for all. Because of that, the farmers started to engage in subversive activities by
setting fire to lands, robbing and destroying the landowners. At the same time, the
rulers of the new government worked in unison with capitalists going against the
expectations of the underprivileged. Soldiers too became disheartened because the
new government too continued the war.
 Revolution in October 1917
At the same time, Bolsheviks under the leadership of Lenin worked with the aim of
creating a government of farmers and labourers by establishing organizations called
Soviet Bureaus all over the country. There were two political groups as Bolsheviks
and Mensheviks at the beginning of the Russian revolution. Mensheviks were the
minority that believed that the problems of people can be solved through minor
reforms. The majority were the Bolsheviks who believed in communism. Their
aim was to build a class free society based on communist ideas by breaking down
the capitalist economic system. This organization which was headed by Lenin and
Trotsky received the support of underprivileged groups such as labourers, farmers,
soldiers etc. The temporary government which was established after the March
revolution, was disliked by the people because they could not solve the burning
problems of people. V.I. Lenin who noticed the emerging objection of people against

problems of people. V.I. Lenin who noticed the emerging objection of people against
- 123 -
the temporary government said, “If we do not grasp power at this moment, history
will not sympathize on us.” Accordingly the revolution was started in October
1917. Armed forces captured the major government centres (railways, banks, post
offices). Rebels protested along streets under the theme, ‘peace, land, and food’.
The Tsar’s administration was completely wiped out and instead of that a new group
of officers was appointed that was selected based on the soviet bureaus consisting
of labourers and farmers. Russia was named as United States of Soviet Russia after
the revolution. Thus, Russia became a country that accepted the socialist concept.
 Socialist Philosophy
Socialism is a political point of view that follows the communist concepts such as
the acceptance of common rights of people for the wealth of the society, providing
every person equal opportunity to develop their skills and equal distribution of
production gains to all. Therefore;
 priority was given to common development and common needs over personal
needs
 wiping out of social injustic and inequality
shedding all class differences in the society;
were the characteristics of this society.
 building up of a noble human society that treats everybody in comradeship
The spreading of socialist philosophy all over the world is another result of the
Russian revolution. Socialism and capitalism became the two major trends in the
society after World War II. Therefore, most of the countries in the world that were
favourable towards Russia included aspects of socialism into their constitutions.
e.g. :- China, East Germany, South Korea, Cuba are some of them.
As mentioned at the beginning of this lesson after the American revolution, the
powerful country called America was created and a capitalist group of countries
camped around America accepting the capitalist economic system.
After the Russian revolution, another group of countries camped around Russia
accepting socialism. The countries that did not belong to either camp became non-
aligned countries. Sri Lanka is a country that follows non-aligned principles.

The middle class and soldiers who understood that no protection could be expected
from the government did not show any opposition to the protestors. This revolution
was supported by all but rulers. This proves how critical was the pressure felt by
the Russians. That is how they could win the revolution without much retaliation.
According to the world accepted calendar the revolution took place in November,
but according to the calendar used in Russia it was October. Hence, this revolution
became to be known as 1917 October revolution.
 The Results of the Revolution
The major result of this revolution is the establishment of a government by
Bolsheviks headed by Lenin by defeating the government led by Kerensky. The
Bolshevik party later became the Communist party. Lenin’s government could
end the war with Germany and bring peace to the country. Thus, Russia became a
peaceful country. That was the expectation of the soldiers. Lenin’s new government
abolished the personal land ownership that existed under the feudal system. The
land taken over to the government was distributed among farmers to be cultivated
as small farms and later they were turned into big communal farms. Thus, farmers
started cultivating under communal ownership. The farmers received the land they
expected under this system. All the factories in Russia were peopalized and their
management was given to Soviet Bureaus of labourers under the guidance of the
communist party. In addition to this, banks and transportation too were peoplized.

World Wars and Conventions
Introduction
The two world wars that affected the whole world took place during the first half
of the 20th century. Both of these wars started in Europe and then spread into the
other continents. These battles are called world wars because a number of powerful
countries took part in these wars and affected the whole world. World leaders
stepped into different conventions in order to avoid further world wars because
of the disaster caused in the first two world wars. This lesson focuses its attention
on the factors that led to the world wars, their nature, results as well as the United
Nation’s Organization and its importance.
8.1 World War I
The war that spread throughout the world between 1914 and 1918 is named as World
War I. The history does not know any war that invaded every continent before this.
This war began in Europe and later spread into their colonies also. Thereafter, when
United States too joined the war, it became a world war that invaded all continents.
 Reasons for World War I
• France and Germany became enemies in the attempt of making a united
Germany.
There was no country called Germany at the
beginning of the 19th century though there were
about 350 small states where people who spoke the
German language. It was the skillful leader called
Otto von Bismarck who created the country called
Germany by making those small states united.
Bismarck established the united Germany in 1870
and started a war with France to show the strength
of Germany. France suffered heavy losses in this
war. Since then these two neighbouring countries
became arch rivals.

The creator of Germany, Bismarck was satisfied with

But the German emperor (Keizer) in 1887, King
William II was not so satisfied. His aim was to establish
a German empire through colonization
by acting against the aims of Bismarck.

The war that spread throughout the world between 1914 and 1918 is named as World
War I. The history does not know any war that invaded every continent before this.
This war began in Europe and later spread into their colonies also. Thereafter, when
United States too joined the war, it became a world war that invaded all continents.
 Reasons for World War I
• France and Germany became enemies in the attempt of making a united
Germany.
There was no country called Germany at the
beginning of the 19th century though there were
about 350 small states where people who spoke the
German language. It was the skillful leader called
Otto von Bismarck who created the country called
Germany by making those small states united.
Bismarck established the united Germany in 1870
and started a war with France to show the strength
of Germany. France suffered heavy losses in this
war. Since then these two neighbouring countries
became arch rivals.

by acting against the aims of Bismarck.
In this attempt the foreign affairs policy
of Germany generated suspicion among other nations in the world. German forces
Fig 8.2 German Emperor William II
- 127 -
were strengthened in order to establish a German empire. Britain was distressed
with this fact and strengthened their forces in competition to Germany. Thus, there
emerged a tensed situation in Europe.
• Competition for colonies
By the mid 19th century the powerful countries in Europe had entered a competition
of establishing colonies in Asia and Africa. Britain could claim the highest number
of colonies here. The runners up were Belgium, France, Portugal, Spain and Holland.
Germany that was able to achieve a rapid industrial development after the
establishment of a united Germany, wanted to find a market for their products. The
other nations were suspicious about Germany’s approach towards Asia and Africa.
Specially, Britain took this as a challenge to their existing power. This competition
for colonies manured hostile feelings between powerful nations who were in
opposition.
• Competition for Armaments and Development of Racism
Since the latter part of the 19th century, every powerful country in Europe (Germany,
Britain, France, and Russia) believed in being armed to increase their power. A
German commander, Von Volk has said, “you will have to be armed for 50 years
to protect what you have gained in 5 years by means of armaments.” This shows
the dependence on armaments the Germans had. There was a competition for
armament production among some European countries because they depended on
armament production.
On the other hand, because Germany and Italy became united based on nationalism,
a nationalistic trend began to grow in Europe. A special characteristic in nationalism
is that they treat their country in high regard considering other countries as inferior
to them. This situation created problems among nations.
• Foreign Policy of Bismarck that tried to isolate France in Europe
Bismarck of Germany who defeated France in war in 1870 captured the two fertile
areas called Alsace and Lorraine that belonged to France. Because of that Germany
was always in fear that France would fight back in revenge and recapture Alsace
and Lorraine. Therefore, the foreign policy of Germany after 1870 was building
friendship with powerful countries in Europe and working to isolate France in
Europe. Two camps of countries emerged based on France and Germany in Europe
because France too started building friendships with European nations. As a result
of this, one camp was created by Germany, Austria and Italy and the other was built
including Britain, France and Russia. Here, the camp including Germany was called
the central powers and the camp with France was called the Allied camp. The other
countries too joined one of these camps according to their necessities. Since then,
till 1914 there were verbal battles between these camps.
• Assassination of Austria’s Heir of Throne
Fig 8.3 – A picture depicting the assassination of Franz Ferdinand and his wife and
the vehicle they travelled
When Europe was on the verge of a war, the heir to the throne in Austria, prince
Franz Ferdinand and his wife were murdered when they were touring in Sarajevo, the
capital of Bosnia. This was done by two Serbians.
Austria treated this as a conspiracy against them
and demanded for compensation from Serbia
under certain conditions. Austria declared war
against Serbia on the 28th July 1914 because Serbia
refused to compensate. This incident which is
called the ‘Sarajevo incident’ is believed to be the
closest reason for the beginning of World War I.

 The spread of World War I
The declaration of war against Serbia by Austria in Sarajevo incident was hailed
by Germany which was a friendly country of Austria. Therefore, Austria as well as
Serbia wanted to gain help from their friendly countries. Serbia which was afraid of
the military power of Austria requested for aid from Russia and Russia too agreed
to give assistance.
Though Germany which was partial to Austria requested Russia not to support
Serbia, Russia ignored the request. Therefore, Germany too entered the war in
support of Austria. As a result, Germany declared war against Russia on the 01st of
August 1914.
By that time France and Russia had been friendly countries and Germany which
thought that France would support Russia because of their friendship declared war
against France also with no second thoughts. There was a hatred between Germany
and France since Germany was united. Germany thought of attacking France
before she entered war and invaded Belgium and started attacking France through
Belgium. Britain considering this stubborn behaviour of Germany a threat to their
security and because of the friendship between Britain and France, she came in
support of France declaring war against Germany. Britain had colonies all around
the world by that time. Because Britain entered war, the effects of war were felt by
all the colonies too.
There had been fights both on land and sea between the two parties. There were long
drawn battles in which modern weapons were used. Germany kept on launching
submarine attacks. As a result, one out of four ships launched by Britain were
attacked by German submarines.
- 130 -
 United States of America joining the war
United States of America, which was a powerful country by this time, was impartial
at the beginning. They entered war because one of their commuter ships, Lusitania
was drowned by a German submarine. America joining the allied forces was one
of the major reasons for the defeat of Germany. The mass food storage America
possessed, the army and navy which numbered up to two million soldiers and the
modern weapons became unbearable threats to the opposition.
A special incident that took place during the war is that Italy which was in the central
camp came into a secret agreement with the Allies and declared war on Germany.
Because of this act military secrets that were there between Germany and Austria
fell into the hands of the enemies and this became a disadvantage to Germany.
Fig 8.5 The ship Lusitania
Because of the attacks of Allied forces, Germany lost its forces and their military
power became weakened. There was a food shortage in the country and it made
the forces irritable. At the same time, there were riots among the general public.
The emperor gave up his throne because the German navy rebelled to dethrone the
emperor and this incident quickened the defeat of Germany. Thus, the World War
I which lasted from 1914 to 1918 came to an end with the defeat of central powers
headed by Germany.
- 131 -
 Results of World War I
• The most significant incident is the victory of allied groups by defeating the
central powers.
• The loss of many lives and wealth because firearms were used and millions of
people had become disabled.
• Versailles convention
Leaders of many countries took part in discussions held in Paris in January
1919 for a peace pact at the end of war.
Names of those leaders are;
President of the United States of America – Woodrow Wilson
Prime minister of Britain
Prime minister of France
Prime minister of Italy
– Jorge Loide
– George Clemenceau
– Vittorio Orlando
As a result of these peace talks, several agreements were signed with the defeated
parties. The Versailles convention signed with Germany was among them. Germany
was severely punished as the convict of the war.
Punishments given to Germany in the Versailles Convention
• Germany had to pay a huge compensation to the wining countries.
• Restrictions were laid against Germany in keeping forces and the production of
armament.
• Resubmission of Alsace and Lorraine areas to France.
• Dividing Germany’s colonies outside Europe among the victorious countries.
• Downfall of the dictatorship monarchies in Europe. Dictatorship monarchies
like German empire, Austria Hungary Empire, Turkey Empire fell down. New
independent countries emerged based on different nationalities.
e.g.: Finland, Poland, Czechoslovakia
• The whole of Europe faced an economic demise because the production weakened
and price of goods went up due to the economic downfall. The United States of
America and Britain became powerful countries in the world at the end of the
war. Britain was able to improve its naval power and the number of colonies they
had too increased.
- 132 -
• Steps were taken to establish an organization called the League of Nations Union
to protect the world from such disasters in the future.
8.2. League of the Nations Union
The necessity of establishing an international organization to avoid such wars and
maintain peace and security in the world was highlighted in the peace talks held
in Paris in 1919. The president of United States of America, Woodrow Wilson
pioneered in this. The League of the Nations Union was established on the 10th
of January 1920 as a result of this. There were 42 countries in this union at the
beginning.
Objectives of establishing the League of the Nations Union
• Giving peaceful resolutions to conflicts between countries
• Avoiding world wars in the future
• Improving international understanding and harmony
• Protecting the freedom and sovereignty of small countries
• Protection of world peace through universal harmony
 Attempts of the League of the Nations Union for Peace
The League of the Nations union was able to avoid wars for about 20 years after its
establishment. The reason for that was the respectful obedience to the decisions
shown by both big and small countries during the first few years of the union. Some
instances where the League of the Nations Union became successful were;
• prevent the wars that broke out between countries like; Sweden and
Finland, Germany and Poland, Greece and Bulgaria and Iran and Turkey.
• working for the rehabilitation of refugees.
• conducting supervision of colonies that were put under the guardianship of
the League of the Nations Union well, after the World War I.
• taking steps to weaken slavery and drug business.
- 133 -
 Reasons for the failure of the League of the Nations Union
The primary objective of establishing the League of the Nations Union was to
protect world peace and stop further wars. But within 20 years of the establishment
of the League of the Nations Union, the convict of World War I, Germany began
World War II also. It was clear that Nations Union’s objective of stopping further
wars could not be achieved. There were several reasons for this failure.
• United States of America which was wealthy and a country with military power
did not become a member of this union. The American senate refused to agree with
some principles laid according to the requirements of the member countries of the
League of the Nations Union. Therefore, a powerful country like America was not
bound to protect the principles of the league of the Nations Union. This caused the
failure of the union. On the other hand keeping Russia, another powerful nation in
the world away from the league of the Nations Union too affected it badly.
• The League of the Nations Union failed in encouraging its members to put its
decisions into action. The reason for that is because the union did not have such
power to get its members function according to its decisions. There was no military
force in the union and there was no common agreement to employ a peace keeping
force.
• Another challenge the union faced was that there was no unity among the powerful
nations that were the members of the union and they were reluctant to give priority
to common needs keeping their personal objectives aside. The members of the
League of the Nations Union didn’t pay enough attention to Germany’s resignation
from the union before World War II. The reason was that they were happy with
Germany’s role played in attacking communism.
• The union was not able to work against some countries that disturbed world
peace. When Italy invaded Abyssinia, economic restrictions were imposed against
them. Yet, the union failed to implement them efficiently.
• Another example is the time Japan invaded Manchuria. No action was taken
against Japan in this incident.
The result of the failure of the League of the Nations Union was another World War.
It was World War II.

is called World War II.
 Reasons for World War II
Though World War II began in 1939, it did not break out so suddenly. The
competition that existed between powerful countries and the behaviour of some
European countries set the background for another war in about a decade after
World War I. When this situation is considered, several reasons that kindled the war
can be identified. Let’s study those in detail.
01. Hitler's rise to power in Germany and his conduct
After World War I, western countries got together to establish a new government in
Germany which was called as “Weimar Republic”. The Failure of the Weimar
Republic in finding solutions to the problems faced by Germany in the contemporary
society, paved way to a ruler like Hitler to come to power in Germany. Germany had
to pay a vast compensation according to the Versailles convention. Because Germany
spent her capital completely to pay compensation for war after 1920, the Weimar
Republic started printing money in large quantities. This created a high inflation in
the country reducing the real value of money. The price of goods went up rapidly
and the unemployment rate too increased. Hitler’s followers took the advantage of

the country reducing the real value of money. The price of goods went up rapidly
and the unemployment rate too increased. Hitler’s followers took the advantage of
- 135 -
this situation. Germany too suffered the adverse effects of the world economic
demise of 1929. As a result the prices of goods and unemployment rate increased in
Germany. There were labour strikes in some cities. Though many countries faced
this situation, Hitler’s followers began to claim that the democratic Weimar Republic
could not solve problems.
Adolf Hitler was an Austrian. He fought for
Germany in World War I. He was imprisoned during
the Weimar Republic for conspiring against the
government. While in prison, he wrote a famous
book called, “Mein Kampf (My War)”. He presented
his ideas about German Nazism in this book. Hitler
who was released from prison kept on spreading an
insane racism. He was able to become the German
Chancellor by capturing the power in the German
parliament (Reichstag) in 1933. His party was named
as National Socialist Party.
Fig 8.6 Adolf Hitler
Nazism
• Nazism which emerged against democracy, communism, and capitalism, bore
as its basic concept that Germans are the noblest nation that descends from
pure Aryans.
• Another special characteristic of Nazism is looking down upon Jews.
• Hitler has explained Nazism in his book ‘Mein Kampf ’.
• Nazism is a political system that was based on party dictatorship.
It is said that Hitler had conducted speeches before his instructors to get practice in
making public speeches to attract people. He came to power in 1933 with the support
of the other members in the parliament. Yet, he gradually established his power
and started being a dictator. When Hitler became the chancellor, the president of
Germany was Von Hindenburg. Old Hindenburg died soon and Hitler grasped the
president’s power also. He got his followers set fire to the parliament building in an
approaching election and accused communists of it. Then he abolished all political
- 136 -
parties and started murdering his opponents such as communists and Jews. Here,
his secret police force, the Gestapo and the SS force engaged themselves in brutal
massacres. Hitler was a person who abused mass media completely for his advantage.
His media minister Goebbels, violated all media ethics and used mass media to
create a public opinion which was partial to Hitler. Hitler completely disturbed the
democracy of Germany. The freedom of press, freedom of meeting and freedom of
expressing ideas were completely banned. The contemporary Germans tolerated
these things with the expectation of a noble Germany as was promised by Hitler. The
western capitalist countries did not oppose Hitler because they were happy about
the destruction caused to communism by Hitler’s brutal massacres of communists
in Germany. This apparently made Hitler more and more stubborn.
Hitler who quitted the League of the Nations Union in 1934 drew Germany back to
war. Hitler invaded neighbouring Austria in1938 and started a Nazi reign there by
attaching it to Germany. Then, Hitler focused his attention on Czechoslovakia and
by separating the Germans and Czechoslovakians, he supported the establishment
of a new country called Sudetenland. After that, Hitler invaded both Sudetenland
and Czechoslovakia and took them under the power of Germany. The western
countries did not oppose Hitler's actions till he invaded Poland. But with Hitler’s
invasion of Poland, countries like Britain and France started fighting against Hitler.
That was the beginning of World War II. Hitler who came to power in 1933 started
World War II by empowering Germany in 6 years and Allied forces including
America, England and Russia had to fight Hitler for 6 years to defeat him and wipe
out Nazism from the world.
During this period, Hitler had established concentration camps and got millions
of innocent Jews and Russians assassinated. Some examples for such camps are
Auschwitz, Bergen Belsen, Belzec and Sobibor. People of the whole world had to
suffer due to the invasive policies carried out by leaders like Hitler during World
War II. The development of the whole world was drawn back for several years
because the whole world had to pay its attention to war. The biggest destruction
after World War I was caused during World War II.
- 137 -
colonies they expected. As a result, there were several economic problems such as
unemployment, food shortage etc. At the same time, labour strikes broke out because
of increasing labour problems. Benito Mussolini who exploited this situation,
captured political power through Fascist political party in 1922. His political
system is known as Fascism. It is also a single party dictatorship like Nazism of
Hitler. Mussolini who captured power in Italy started hunting his enemies using the
armed soldiers called ‘Black Shirt Army’. Though
Mussolini could strengthen the economy of Italy
through dictatorship, his attempt became a failure
amidst the bad effects of world economic demise
in 1929. First, Mussolini gathered all internal
powers into his hand and later started spread the
power of Italy internationally. It was in 1870 that
Italy became a united country just as Germany.
By that time, the other European nations had
captured many of the fertile areas of the world. As
a result, the existing condition was likely to create
battles among European nations in the attempt
of Italy to establish colonies. In 1936, Mussolini
invaded and captured Abyssinia of Africa which is
known as Ethiopia today. Later Mussolini joined
Hitler in the World War II in order to improve Fascist power. There, the Fascist and
Nazi powers fought against the countries headed by England, Russia and America.
Mussolini was arrested towards the end of World War II and lost his life at the end.

03. The conduct of Japan
Japan came forward as a developed Asian country towards the end of the 19th century.
They had the necessity of finding raw materials for their productions and markets
for their products. Yet, by that time, many areas of Asia had become colonies of
European nations. Hence, Japan’s attempt to fulfill its economic needs or building
a Japanese empire in Asia resulted in a situation which led Japan to have problems
with European nations. In 1934, Japan invaded Manchuria in Northern China and
captured it. Japan’s incursive behaviour was discussed in the League of the Nations
Union and Japan was found guilty of invasion. Here, Japan resigned from the League
of the Nations Union and continued their invasive conduct by capturing several

child prisoners who were

02. The conduct of Mussolini in Italy
Though Italy was in the victorious group in World War I, the peace pacts signed
after war were not so profitable for them. They could not obtain the number of
- 138 -
- 139 -
colonies they expected. As a result, there were several economic problems such as
unemployment, food shortage etc. At the same time, labour strikes broke out because
of increasing labour problems. Benito Mussolini who exploited this situation,
captured political power through Fascist political party in 1922. His political
system is known as Fascism. It is also a single party dictatorship like Nazism of

European nations. Hence, Japan’s attempt to fulfill its economic needs or building

captured it. Japan’s incursive behaviour was discussed in the League of the Nations
Union and Japan was found guilty of invasion. Here, Japan resigned from the League
of the Nations Union and continued their invasive conduct by capturing several
- 139 -
important harbours and cities of China. In the same way as Hitler’s and Mussolini’s
behaviour affected Europe, Japan’s behaviour affected Asia. Thus, Japan had become
the invader in Asia by the time World War II began. Thus, Japan’s behaviour paced
up the approach of war to Asia.
04. Weaknesses of the League of the Nations Union
It was explained above that the objective of establishing the League of the League of
the Nations Union was to protect world peace and avoiding war. Nevertheless, the
Union did not possess power or ability to avoid war.
Several countries entered into friendly agreements because the collaboratively
established Nations Union to avoid wars failed in its task. As a result of this, the
powerful nations started to be armed for the security of their group. This being
armed set a background of war.
 Participants of World War II
Allied Powers which were Britain, France, United States of Americe (western
liberalist countries) belonged to this group. Communist Russia too was an allied
country.
The European countries; Germany and Italy entered into a secret agreement with
Japan in 1937. This group was named the Berlin, Rome, Tokyo axis after their capital
cities. Later, the term “Axis Powers” was used to name these three countries.

 Expansion of World War II
World War II began when Hitler of Germany invaded Poland on 01 September,
1939. Britain and France that had vowed to protect Poland joined the war declaring
war against Germany. Germany defeated Poland within four weeks. Continuing
his belligerence, Hitler captured the countries; Norway, Denmark, Holland and
Belgium. He attacked France in June, 1940 and captured her capital city, Paris.
Fig 8.12 – British fighter aircraft
With the approach of German forces into Paris,
Mussolini too joined war invading different
parts of France across the territories of Italy.
Thus, as a result of the agreement made after
German and Italian forces capturing France,
Germany took France into her hand.
Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister
who considered the defeat of France an insult to
Britain understood the value of being strategic
in facing future threats. Churchill who was an
eloquent speaker and a skillful leader was able
- 142 -
Fig 8.13 – Winston Churchill
- 143 -
to motivate the whole British population to fight against Nazism. He built a war
front against Germany including British colonies such as Canada, Australia, New
Zealand, South Africa, India and Ceylon. In addition to that, USA supported Britain
a lot.
 USA joins the war
How Japan tried to build an empire in Asia while Germany and Italy were capturing
European countries was discussed above. There, Japan had to fight the countries such
as Britain, USA and France who had many colonies in the eastern part of the world.
The camp in Pearl Harbour became an obstacle to Japan in these battles. Therefore,
Japan bombed the American navy camp in Pearl Harbour on 07 November, 1941.
The American president, Franklin Roosevelt declared war against Japan on this
incident. Germany and Italy that were partial to Japan had declared war against
America, following the above incident. Thus, the war that was limited to Europe
grew into a world war until the end of 1941.
The Germany’s next target was Britain. Hitler decided to invade Britain using his
air force and commanded them to bomb British air ports and cities. Britain too
possessed strong naval and air forces. Then, Britain too employed fighter planes
to attack enemy craft. Ferocious attacks took place between the two parties on 14
September, 1940. It was reported that the British air force dropped about 56 German
aircraft. Hitler gave up attacking Britain once he understood that Britain’s military
power and its talent were too stronger than he guessed.

 Germany invading Russia
After the above mentioned incidents, Hitler attacked Russia with no any clear
reason. He thought that he would be able to capture Russia easily. The French
emperor, Napoleon Bonaparte attacked Russia before this and retreated after a great
loss with thousands of casualties. Hitler too faced a similar loss after 125 years.
Soviet forces had foreseen such an attack and were ready to retaliate. So, they were
well equipped with all strategies to misguide the enemy. One such strategy was to
keep the German forces in Russia till the severe cold season approached. The Nazi
forces too underwent the same destiny Napoleon’s forces faced. German forces were
not prepared to face a long winter season. Therefore, severe coldness, food shortage
and diseases caused many deaths among German forces. Hitler was not tactful
enough to retreat. Ignorant to the critical conditions his forces were facing in Russia,
Hitler commanded them to move forward. There, the Russian red forces were able
to defeat the German forces easily.
 Germany surrenders
Russia continued fighting and progressed towards Germany liberating the areas that
were in the hands of Nazis. At the same time, French and American forces launched
attacks from the western front. The allied forces that reached Germany by March
1945 came to Berlin by May. Hitler and many of his commanders, who understood
that their defeat was close by, committed suicide. Thus, Germany surrendered with
no conditions in May 1945.
 Japan surrenders
Japan captured using its military power, the British colonies such as; Singapore,
Malaysia, Burma, Hong Kong. Later, they captured countries like Borneo, Java,
Sumatra and Philippines. Thus, by 1942 whole Southeast Asia except Ceylon and
India seemed to have surrendered.
Japan bombed Colombo on o5th April 1942 and Trincomalee on 07th April. Because
of that, Britain suspecting that Japan would invade Ceylon placed several platoons
in Ceylon. Yet no battle between the two parties took place in Ceylon.

Fig 8.15 – The atomic bomb dropped
on Hiroshima
Severe battles took place between the allied forces and Japan resulting in the defeat
of Japan. Because the final warning issued to already losing Japan by allied forces
was ignored, USA attacked Hiroshima on 06th August, 1945 and Nagasaki on 09th
August with atomic bombs. The two cities were destroyed in a few seconds and
more than one hundred thousand people died. More than that was injured. Many
more generations became ill due to the harmful effects of radiation. World War II
came to an end when the emperor Hirohito of Japan agreed to surrender under no
conditions seeing the destruction.

on these two countries. Countries headed by USA were called as capitalist camp and
the group led by Russia was identified as socialist camp.

 Results of World War II
• The axis powers that included Germany, Italy and Japan were defeated in World
War II.
• That was the most devastating war that took place on this earth. It is believed
that more than 50 million people died in this war. The loss of property and wealth
cannot be valued.
• Under Hitler’s plan of massacring Jews, millions of Jews in areas like Germany,
Poland and Hungary where there was German power were put into concentration
camps and murdered.
• Atomic bombs were used as a weapon and the terrible destruction caused by
them shocked not only the losers but also the winners. A countless number of
lives were lost due to the use of atomic bombs and their terrible results are still
felt even after generations.
• France and Britain who were world leaders lost their positions and their
imperialist concepts were broken down. As a result, colonies of Britain and
France such as Sri Lanka, India and Indo China got independence.
• USA took steps to uplift the devastated defeated countries in Europe. This aid
program was named ‘Martial Plan’ after the state secretary of USA, John Martial.
• USA and Russia became the two central powers of the world after the world
war. USA became the protector of democracy whereas Soviet Russia became the
protector of socialism. Several other countries also divided into two camps based

Hitler’s forces
World was divided into two camps like this after World War II and continued a
battle to win their own ideas using different strategies other than weapons. This is
called the ‘Cold War or Weaponless War’. This existed for about four decades after
World War II. Basic strategies employed here were;
• using spy services
• establishment of different organizations
launching of aid programmes etc
After World War II, Asian and African countries got the opportunity of obtaining
independence getting freed from colonization. USA and Russia extended their
support to uplift the social and economic status of those countries. Their intention
was to win those countries to their camps. Those countries had to be partial to the
countries who gave them aid directly or indirectly and it became a problem for
their sovereignty. Therefore, they established the Non-Aligned Movement with the
intention of being impartial without going with either of the central powers. It was
established in 1961. The late Indian Prime Minister, Sri Jawaharlal Nehru was a
pioneering leader of this movement.

Results of World War II
8. 4 United Nations Organization
While World War II was going on, the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill
and the USA President, Franklin Roosevelt signed the Atlantic convention in August
1941. This document which explained why the allied forces joined the war, focused
its attention on receiving international support for peace and paying attention to
protecting the independence and sovereignty of nations. Based on this agreement,
names of 26 nations who fought against axis
powers were declared in January 1942 in
Washington. The term ‘United Nations’ was
first used here to name those nations. After
that, in October 1943, foreign ministers
of Russia, Britain, America and China
conducted discussions in Moscow about
establishing an international organization
for peace.

In December 1943 in Teheran, the three
central powers of the world,
USA President, Franklin Roosevelt
British Prime Minister, Winston
Churchill
Russian leader Joseph Stalin
conducted further discussions about this.
There the proposal for establishing an
organization for world peace was accepted
by those leaders. Thus, a discussion was held
in June 1945 in San Francisco of USA for
designing the United Nations Convention to
establish the United Nations Organization.
Representatives of 50 countries attended
this. Poland who did not attend the conference later signed the convention. Thus
the number of starting members was 51. The organization was officially started
in 24 October, 1945 by giving official approval to the convention. Hence, 24th of
October is considered the United Nations’ Day.

There are 15 members in this council. USA, Soviet Union, United Kingdom, France
and China are permanent members. The term of membership of the other 10
members is limited to 2 years. The permanent members enjoy veto power. Veto
power means that if one member disagrees with a proposal, that proposal would
become void. Every member is bound under the charter to accept and carry out the
decisions of the Security Council.
The main function of the Security Council is to probe into conflicts that could be
a threat to international peace and security and forward proposals to settle them
peacefully. Other important functions of the council are imposing economic
restrictions and taking military actions if necessary against invaders.

have several affiliated institutions to carry out the functioning of this council.
International Labour Organization (ILO), Food and Agricultural Organization
(FAO), United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO),
International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Health Organization (WHO), United
Nations Children’s Fund (UNISEF) are among them.
- 151 -
 The Trusteeship Council
The main duty of this council is the administration of the areas taken under United
Nations trusteeship. There were 11 trusteeship territories at the time the United
Nations Organization was established. All those nations got independence by 1994.
This council became inactive since then. The World Leaders Council suspended its
functioning under the secretary general’s recommendation.
 The International Court of Justice

situated in Hague of Netherland. The judges are selected from those who held
highest positions in the courts of member countries and specialists of international

 The Secretariat
The main administration body of the United Nations is the Secretariat. This is
situated in New York city of USA. The chief of this office is the secretary-general
appointed for a period of 5 years by the General Assembly on the recommendation
of the Security Council. The secretary- general has the power to forward any matter
he believes that would be a threat to international peace and security, to the Security
Council. Many officers are there around the world for the duties of the secretariat.
There are about 9000 officers working in these offices.
 Attempts made by the United Nations to protect the world peace
The United Nations Organization which was established with the objective of making
the future generations free of threats of devastating wars started its functioning by
establishing the ‘Atomic Energy Commission.’ They must have started with this
step to show the world the necessity of controlling atomic energy because of the
destruction caused by the atomic bombs in World War II.
The powerful countries tend to work strategically for the victory of their camp as
a result of the two camps created after World War II with USA and Russia as two
heads. This war which was carried out without weapons was called the “Cold War”
or weaponless war.
Several situations that came closer to fights were settled before developing into
battles by the mediation of the United Nations. Some examples for such situations
• Suez Conflict
The president of Egypt, Abdul Gamal Nasser peoplised the Suez Canal following
the socialist economic tradition. Because French companies had to face difficulties
due to this decision, they sent forces of Israel, Britain and France to Suez area. The
United Nations were able to settle this problem.
• Gulf Conflict
Based on an oil rig located in Iraq and Kuwait border, this conflict arose. Iraq
invaded Kuwait because of that. This war which was only a little inferior to a world
- 153 -
war caused huge destruction. Later, the United Nations mediated and settled the
matter.
• Cuban Missile Conflict
Those who escaped to USA from Cuba during the Cuban Revolution got armed
training in USA and came back to Cuba armed against the Fidel Castro’s government.
Because the rebels were supported by USA, Russia placed missiles in Cuba so that
USA could be attacked. Because of this USA surrounded Cuba and placed missiles
in Turkey aiming at Russia. This conflict was settled by the general secretary of the
United Nations.
Steps the United Nations can take to protect world peace today
We discussed above how several conflicts that took place between countries after
World War II were settled by the United Nations Organization. There are several
steps the United Nations can take in resolution of conflicts that emerge between
countries and protecting world peace. When there are incidents that threaten world
peace, the Security Council of United Nations mediates to settle the matter. That is
because the main responsibility of international peace and security lies in the hands
of the Security Council.
Several steps the United Nations can take to protect world peace on the
recommendations of the Security Council are;
Imposing Economic Restrictions
The countries that do not respect the decisions of the United Nations are forced to
oblige their orders by imposing economic restrictions.
Taking steps to limit and control the production of nuclear weapons
When there is information about countries that start producing new nuclear
weapons, the United Nations Commissions are sent to investigate them. Such
commissions were appointed to examine the nuclear weapons in North Korea and
Iraq.
Employment of Peace Keeping Forces
The peace keeping force of the United Nations is employed to control the situation
when there are severe battles between two parties.
