Finger Millet
Finger millet (Eleusine Coracana) is a traditional
grain that is popular in Sri Lanka because of its
nutritional value. It is called Kurakkan in Sinhala and
Tamil. Vitamin B, iron and calcium are all present in
abundance in finger millet. It is also rich in dietary fibre
and helps in easy digestion. Therefore it is an excellent
remedy for constipation as it acts as a natural laxative.
It is low in fat content but rich in carbohydrates which
makes it good for people who are overweight. The
digestion process of finger millet is slow and therefore
helps in keeping the blood
sugar at a low level. As a result, it has become a favourite
food among diabetic patients. This wholesome grain is
made into porridge, idli, pittu, rotti, hoppers and bread
in various regions. It is increasingly becoming popular
as a bakery product and recently its demand has
increased considerably as people have become aware
of its health benefits. Organically grown finger millet
is healthier and safer to eat as there are no harmful
chemicals used in growing it.
In Sri Lanka, it is grown
in Anuradapura, Kegalle Moneragala, Hambantota,
Ratnapura, Nuwara Eliya, Ampara, Badulla and
Jaffna districts. It is a hardy crop that is well adapted
to arid highland areas in Africa and Asia. The crop is
now grown on a larger scale in India. It grows best
in an environment with medium rainfall, an annual
temperature range of 11°C to 27°C and a soil of pH
range of 5.0 to 8.2. It is a crop that has great potential
if promoted as a healthy food.
