7.1 Selecting a business idea
All the products, services, processes and techniques of today’s world are the solutions
offered to problems faced by mankind. They all are results of business ideas.
Think of the need for drinking water. Lack of sufficient drinking water supply is a
common issue faced by many schools. Hence bottles of different sizes and shapes
have been introduced to the market in order to bring water from homes. Since it was
difficult to pack those water bottles in school bags due to their circular surfaces,
cube shaped bottles were introduced to the market. As a result water bottles which
can be carried without difficulties with books were created.
In this way, using their thinking towards the problems faced by people, creative
individuals generate business ideas. Through observing the environment, it can be
recognized that those ideas convert to viable businesses which produce different
alternatives to satisfy personal and social needs.
The concept of business ideas
A business idea is a thought having a commercial value which satisfies the needs and
wants of people while being a solution to an existing problem in the environment.
Business ideas are important in entrepreneurship since they emerge combining the
interest and the creativity of an entrepreneur and since it is the first step of creating
a business.
“A dozen of ideas can be bought for ten cents” is a common saying in the field of
business. This implies that there are ample business ideas. Yet all of these ideas
are not converted to a business opportunity. It is the role of the entrepreneur to
transform the ideas in to a business opportunity.

V Ability to successfully face the competition
V Should match with the technology
V Ability to reduce the risk

Step 02
Micro analysis
This analysis should be done for each of the ideas selected under step 01. Under
micro analysis three most suitable business ideas out of the 10 identified above are
selected considering the effect of following criteria on each of the business ideas.
Here, the factors considered under first step are studied in detail.
Criteria which can be used for micro analysis
Having a market
This considers whether there are enough customers when the product is offered to
the market or whether there is adequate sale to earn the required return to survive
in the business. Moreover the ability to expand the business in the future should be
considered.
Ease of finding raw materials
Under this the ease of finding quality raw materials under the lowest possible cost
to engage in continuous production is considered. If it is difficult, this will lead to a
break down in the production process.
Ability to find the required capital
Some business ideas require a substantial initial capital in order to transform
them to business opportunities. The possibility of finding adequate capital under a
minimum cost should be considered.
Government rules and regulations, principles and incentives
Even though very profitable, there are certain government rules and policies which
influence some business fields. Some of them are environmental rules, employee
regulations, consumer protection rules, import-export policies and tax policies. The
extent to which these factors are favourable relating to the expected business idea
and the government incentives like infrastructure facilities, tax reliefs and loan
schemes should also be considered.

Nature of the competition
The entrepreneur should be attentive of the other individuals and the organizations
who offer a same or a substitute product to the product of the entrepreneur, their
strengths and strategies as well as the potential competitors who may enter the
market in the future.
Knowledge, experience, skills and interests of the entrepreneur
The basic knowledge, experience and the interest of the entrepreneur are critical
for the implementation of the business idea under consideration. This makes the
management of business operations easy. Further this factor is important in order to
make decisions of the business and to ensure continual commitment.
Ability to find labour
The availability of skilled and unskilled labour, the cost of recruitment, selection
and training, the ability to pay salaries and wages relating to the business idea
should be considered.
It is important to carry out a study regarding the possibility of the business being
unsuccessful due to earning losses.
Ease of initiation
Here the availability of other barriers to initiate the business and the possibility of
easily initiating the business with minimum resources should be considered.
For micro analysis other criteria which seem suitable can also be used apart from
the above mentioned ones. The entrepreneur will be able to select the most suitable
business opportunity by evaluating the business ideas under more criteria.
It is important to assess the favourableness or the unfavourableness of the business
ideas considered under different criteria. Then it can be entered to a point- scale as
follows and the business ideas can be evaluated through that point-scale using a
table as given below.

7.3 Getting the legal protection for a creative business idea
The entrepreneur who enters the business world through an appropriate business
opportunity can get the legal protection for the business idea. If not, there is a
possibility of acquiring the respective business idea by someone else. Hence a
patent right is often used by a new entrepreneur to protect an intellectual property.
Patent Rights
Patent is the government certification given for a new invention by someone. A new
invention can be defined as a;
V New product
V New machine
V New process
V A combination of above factors
V Improvement to an existing invention
When a new invention is offered to the market others can copy it without it further
being a secret. Hence in order to secure the ownership of the new invention a patent
should be obtained and the validity period of it is 20 years. If required, the patent
right can be sold to another businessman. Then the right passes to the person who
buys it.
