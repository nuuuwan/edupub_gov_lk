Let us learn about development
through childhood
The foundation of growth takes place during the pre natal and infant stages of life.
Studies have shown that 80% of brain cells are formed by the age of 3 years. At
this stage a rapid physical growth is also seen. Physical growth means an increase
in height and weight. By measuring growth parameters (height and weight) we can
determine whether the child is growing adequately. Muscle strength and mobility
are developed with physical growth. Mental and social skills are developed through
interactions with the environment. This is known as a child’s psycho-social
development.
Understanding the psycho-social development of a child helps identify the needs,
importance of fulfilling the needs and ways of fulfilling them. This knowledge will
help you in the future.
In the previous classes we learnt how to lead a healthy life through balancing
different needs in different situations. In this lesson let us learn the stages in
childhood and how their needs could be provided.
Stages in childhood
1. Prenatal stage
2. Neonatal stage
3. Infant stage
4. Early childhood
5. Late childhood
the period inside the mother’s womb
the first 4 weeks after birth
from the first to the twelfth month
from 1 year to 5 years
from 6 years to 10 years
Points to know before becoming a mother.
1. Although the Sri Lankan law permits a girl to get married once she
completes 18 years, it is important to ascertain whether she has adequate
physical and mental maturity. She should be mentally and socially stable.
The family should be financially stable to bring up a child.
It is important to prevent marriages between blood relatives, (e.g: first
cousins or close relatives) as this could lead to some genetic disorders
in the off spring, (e.g: Thalassaemia). This is an important factor to be
considered when considering marriage and pregnancy. Bad effects can be
prevented by a well planned marriage.
3. Folic acid is very important for a woman who is planning on becoming
pregnant after marriage. Sufficient folic acid levels in her body before
and during pregnancy helps to prevent the baby developing brain
and spinal cord abnormalities. Therefore a woman who is planning a
pregnancy should begin taking folic acid supplements weeks before she
gets pregnant. (Folic acid is present in green leaves found plenty in Sri
Lanka)
4. It is important for every girl who has completed 15 years, to get the
rubella vaccination to prevent getting German measles. (If a female has
not received this rubella or MMR vaccine before, it is advised to get the
vaccination at least three months before getting pregnant.)
5. A woman hoping to get pregnant after marriage, should plan it properly.
Medical advice can be sought from health services, attending family
health clinics and maternity clinics with proper planning. A girl can have
an uncomplicated pregnancy and safe motherhood with proper planning.
Prenatal stage (In mother’s womb)
Prenatal stage is the period from the moment the sperm
unites with the ovum until the birth.
The period during pregnancy and the moment of child
birth are the happiest moments in the life of parents. Every
pregnancy should be well-planned and prepared. A pregnant
mother should be in very good physical and mental state.
This is essential for the healthy growth of the new born
baby. During the pre natal stage the mother should be aware
of the progress of her pregnancy.
Figure 2.1
Following are a few steps that can be taken during this period.
1. Once becoming aware of the pregnancy, proper medical advice must be
obtained. In this regard valuable assistance can be obtained from the public
health midwife.
2. Special attention should be paid to the food the mother eats, as it will
affect the growth of the baby. The expected healthy birth weight of a baby
is between 2.5 kg to 3.5 kg. This weight gain is through the necessary
nutrients that are obtained from the mother. So during this period if the
mother does not take a balanced diet, nutritional deficiencies will affect
the growth of the embryo. The child will have a low birth weight, be born
prematurely, have suboptimal mental functions or be prone to infections.
3. A pregnant mother should have a good mental state as it will affect the
development of the baby’s brain. The mother should be free of physical
and mental stress. Other members of the family should share the house
hold work and make her comfortable. She should be happy and relaxed.
Activity
The foundation for the future of the pre natal baby depends on the balanced diet
taken by the mother, as well as the mother being in a good mental and social state
as well as being free of diseases. Considering these points, design a leaflet with
instructions, which can be distributed at the maternity clinic in your area.
Neonatal stage (from birth to one month)
Neonatal stage is the period from birth to 28 days. In
this period the child is exposed to the new environment.
During this period the mother too faces rapid physical
and mental changes. The baby is exposed to the new
environment through the mother. The nutrients needed
for the baby’s physical growth are supplied through
breast milk. Activities induldge in by the mother affect
the baby’s phycho-social development.Therefore
a good mental and physical state in the mother is
important for good psycho-social development of the
baby.

Psycho-social needs
1. Nutritional needs
• Breast feeding the baby when-
1. Love
• While breast feeding hugging and
ever the need arises. This helps
the growth and immunity of the
baby.
2. Growth
• Adequate amount of sleep and rest
is important for the growth of the
baby.
3. Protection
• Protect from cold and heat.
• Protect from physical injuries such
as falls, cuts etc.
• To protect from infections avoid
crowded places, maintain good hy-
giene and keep the baby in a well
ventilated room
cuddling the baby.
2. Stimulation for mental
development
• Petting, talking and singing
lullabies to the baby (though
the baby does not understand)
• Keeping the baby in a well-lit
• Respond to the gestures made
by the baby
• Keep objects that will make
sounds to stimulate the baby
 For extra knowledge
Breast milk is the most important form of nutrition that can be given to a baby
during the first six months of life. Its importance is given below.
1. All the necessary nutrients and required amount of water for the first six
months can be obtained from mother’s milk
2. The milk secreted in the first few days after birth is of a thick yellowish
consistancy known as colostrum. It is secreted in very small amounts and
contains substances that will help to protect the baby from infections and
helps the proper functioning of the digestive system.
3. Mother’s milk is the safest and cleanest food that can be given to a baby.
4. It is always at the correct temperature.
5. It is available at any time the baby requires.
6. Breast feeding strengthens the bond between the mother and the baby.
7. It helps to protect baby from diseases.
8. It helps to prevent obesity in the future.
9. It helps to increase the baby’s mental development.
10. It helps develop resistance against allergies.
Infant stage (from 1 month to 12 months)
The period from one month to twelve
months is considered as the infant stage.
During this stage a baby shows rapid
physical and mental development while
adapting to the social environment.
During this stage it is vital for the mother
to take a well-balanced diet as it affects
the baby directly. The diet should be rich
in vitamin D and calcium. The mother’s
mental state affects the baby, it is important for the mother to be happy.
Figure 2.3
Mother should spend more time with the baby. Therefore the other members of
the family should share the work. This helps the mother’s physical and mental
relaxation.

food should be introduced.
Psychological needs
1. Love and affection
• It is important to create
an environment in and
around the house filled
with love and peace.
If the baby’s growth is less or if mother
goes to work before first 6 months,
complementary food can be started at 4
months.
• Parents including other
members of the family
should express love
towards the baby.

of life.
• By the end of the first year the baby should
be accustomed to family food.
2. Growth
• To monitor growth it is important to
measure the weight every month and height
at least three monthly and mark on the
given growth chart.
If there is a change in pattern of growth
(increase or decrease) get advise from a
doctor.
3. Protection
• Follow the immunization programme
accordingly.

singing frequently to the
baby.
• Creating an environment
filled with different
sounds which soothes the
Early childhood (from 1 year to 5 years)
The period from 1 year to 5 years of a child’s life is called the early childhood.
During this period the child begins to walk and gains experience by exploring the
environment.

Late childhood (from 6 years to 10 years)
The period from 6 years to 10 years of a child’s
life is called late childhood. During this period
the child starts formal education.
In this period the child is very inquisitive, hence
should provide opportunities to explore the
environment. As a result the child builds self-
confidence.

Summary
The period from birth to 10 years of life is called childhood. This is sub divided
to neonatal stage, infant stage, early childhood and late childhood. Pre natal stage
is very important for the growth and development of the child. Every pregnancy
should be well-planned and a pregnant woman should always be in a very good
mental and physical state. It takes about 280 days for the baby to be born after
conception.
The first 28 days is known as the neonatal stage, while 1- 12 months is known as the
infant stage. The period from 1st to 5th year is early childhood and 6 to 10 years
is known as late childhood. Providing the necessary physical and psycho-social
needs during the different periods of childhood is important. The child will then be
properly moulded, achieve optimum physical growth and mental development. A
generation of healthy, intelligent, self-confident, skilful and creative children with
good self-esteem will be a gift to the future world.
