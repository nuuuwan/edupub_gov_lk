Reading
Given below is a part of Yoga’s essay. Read it carefully paying attention to the
highlighted words.
The person who inspired me most
There are many famous people in this
world. People can be famous for many
reasons. First, a person can excel in one
area and become famous. Also he/she can
invent something and become famous.
However there are some practical people
arround us who show us that we can do
many things. Moreover they prove us
that one can become successful not only in one area but also in many different
fields. Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin or commonly known as "Charlie" was an
English actor, comedian and filmmaker, who became world famous, has proved
this very fact. Recently, I read about him in a newspaper. This great person
once said, “You'll never find a rainbow if you're looking down”. This statement
shows how optimistic he is.
Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin was born on 16th April 1889 in Walworth,
London, in the United Kingdom. His parents were singers and actors. After his
father’s death, his family had to face many challenges. As a result his mother
struggled financially. Hence Charlie’s childhood can be described as one with
poverty and hardships. However his mother earned the living by performing on
stage. The situation became worse after the illness of Charlie’s mother, Hannah
Chaplin. He had to start work at the age of nine. All what he inherited from both
his parents were put into practice. Small Charlie’s will power and talent made
him a stage actor and comedian. At the age of 19 he moved to the United States
and joined Fred Karno Company. Charlie could win the hearts of the audience
very soon. In 1913, he entered the cinema world.
