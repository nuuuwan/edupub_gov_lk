There is a high rainfall in Kanneliya from 
May  to  July  and  again  in  the  months 
of  October  and  November,  making  it 
an  ideal  time  to  see  waterfalls.  The 
Anagimale  falls  is  the  closest  waterfall 
to the entrance of the forest reserve. It is 
just  2 km away from the entrance. You 
need to go a little deeper into the forest 
to  see  the  beautiful  waterfall  called 
Narangas Ella.

Kanneliya
Discover,  explore  and  conserve  the 
natural beauty of Sri Lanka.

Location
Kanneliya  Forest  Reserve  is  located 
in    the  Galle  District  in  the  Southern 
Province  about  125  km  away  from 
Colombo.  It  is  one  of  the  largest  forest 
reserves with a high bio-diversity in Sri 
Lanka.

Waterfalls
Inside the forest there are many streams 
adding  life  to  the  vegetation. Although 
deforestation  has  affected  them,  these 
streams create several beautiful cascades.

There are 301 plant species at Kanneliya 
forest reserve, some 133 animal species 
and  59  species  of  birds  making  it  very 
rich in biodiversity.
Hiking
The  water  level  of  the  streams  is  low 
from  March  to  April  and  August  to 
September. Those are ideal times to visit 
Kanneliya for hiking.
