1 Classification of Biblical Books
of the Old Testament
The written source of Divine
Revelation is the Holy Bible. It
is the most sacred book of the
Christians. It is not a single
book. It contains a number of
books, and it itself is a library.
The seventy three books of the
Holy Bible were written through
Divine Inspiration. God is the
principal author of the Holy Bible
and man is the secondary author.
The books in the Holy Bible were
written between 950 B.C. – 100
A.D. The books of the Holy Bible could be divided into two major sections,
namely the “Old Testament” and the “New Testament”. In the Old Testament there
are 46 books, which can be divided into five sections.

Historical Books of the Bible
The Old Testament consists of History of Salvation. ‘History’ of salvation, is not
a record of historical events or time periods or life stories. The experiences and
incidents of people of Israel have been interpreted in the light of faith. Its aim is to
develop the faith of the readers. There are 16 (sixteen) Historical Books. We can
identify them from the above Table.
When we study from the Book of Joshua to 2 Kings, it is clear that when the
Israelites and their faithfulness to the covenant of Sinai (Ten Commandments) they
were victorious or when they were unfaithfulness they were defeated to God. This
shows that by being faithful, one can receive God’s graces and by going against,
one has to face difficulties. Therefore, we can receive God’s blessings by living
according to the covenant of Sinai or Ten Commandments.
Books of Esther and Ruth are two popular historical books. Solutions to the
problems of people or a person are interpreted from a theological point oview.
The books a theological of Ezra or Nehemiah contain the social and
religious restoration of the nation of Judah after the Babylonian exile.
Accordingly it is clear that the historical books of the Old Testament has theological
history and that God has been active in human history.
The Holy Bible and the Living Tradition of the Church
The Divine Word is the basis of Christianity. God created the world by the power
of the Divine Word. This Divine Word was handed down from one generation to
the next by the oral tradition. For example, in the New Testament the first Gospel
was the Gospel of Mark. It was written in 64-66 A.D. Until then any word said by
Jesus Christ was not recorded in any Gospel. From then onwards what Jesus did
and said was compiled into four Gospels. Yet only a small quantity of what Jesus
said and did was written. Gospel of St. John bears witness to this. “Now Jesus
did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this
book” (John 20:30).
“There are also many other things that Jesus did were every one of them to be
written, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be
written” (John 21:25).
Accordingly it is clear that most of the things that Jesus said and did were not
recorded in the four Gospels. Though they are not recorded we cannot leave them
out. The Holy Mother Church through the Living Tradition of the Church pass
them on to the faithful. The teachings that are there in the tradition are also a part
of the Divine Word. The Word of God that is there in the Church Tradition will
last forever. It is proved by the words of St. Peter " The Word of the Lord endures
forever. That Word is the good news which was preached to you”(1 Peter 1:25).
The Word of God (Divine Revelation) has two sources
1. The Holy Bible
2. The Living Tradition of the Church.
In the Living Tradition, the teachings coming down from the time of the apostles
are found. This clearly reveals the identity of the Catholic Church. All the other
Christian Denominations have started afterwards. Only the Catholic Church goes
back to the Apostolic times and the traditions coming down from the time of
Apostles belong to the Catholic Church. Therefore, the Catholic Church follows all
the apostolic traditions, teachings and liturgical practices. If the Catholic Church
follows anything that is not found in the Holy Bible, the Church has received those
from the Living Tradition and those have been nourished in the light of the Holy
Spirit.

There was a new proposal from Grade 10 students to their principal of Daham
Pasala. That is to teach to those who were weak in reading and writing. With the
Parish Priest’s permission, students were able to carry out their proposal. The
parishioners were pleased with these children, their enthusiasm and effort. They
gave their support by supplying food and necessary stationary which they needed
for their project.
Having heard about this programme, other children of the village also came and
joined them, irrespective of their religion and nationality. The Parish Priest and the
villagers were pleased with their programme and encouraged them.
For their work, the Apostolic Church is a good example as mentioned in the Act of
the Apostles.
Acts of the Apostles
Author of the Acts of the Apostles is St. Luke, the evangelist, who wrote the Gospel
of Luke. Most of the people think that it is the second volume of Luke’s Gospel.
Both books were presented to a nobleman, whose name was “Theophilus” (Luke
1:1-4; Acts 1:1) which means “God’s friend”.
St. Luke was a historian, artist and doctor, who joined St. Paul’s second and third
missionary journeys.
Acts of the Apostles was written between 80-90 AD. in Achaia, a territory of Greece
Having filled with the power of the Holy Spirit, the apostles preached the Good
News in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria and to the end of the world (Acts 1:8). This
book contains has they did it. Having become a friend of God we must proclaim the
Good News of Jesus Christ.
The Structure of the Book of the Acts of the Apostles
1. Preparation for the mission (Acts 1)
2. Witnessing in Jerusalem (Acts 2-7)
3. Witnessing in Judea and Sameria (Acts 8-12)
4. The mission of St. Paul (Acts 13-28 )

3 Classification of Epistles
Hashen :
Mother, come and see
Mother:
What is it, Son?
Hashen :
My article is in the news paper
Mother:
It is true. “Is it a challenge to think positively?” I am really proud of
you. From your childhood you were good in writing.
Hashen :
I am also happy about it mother. A lot of people might read this; even
my class teacher also had asked me to write, whenever I get a chance.
Mother:
Hashen :
That’s true my son, one day you should be a good writer. Any writer
can do a good service to the society. There are many writers who are
doing a good service. Son, do you know that there is an extraordinary
writer in the New Testament He is St. Paul.
Yes, as an author, St. Paul did a great service to the early Christian
community; not only that, he had written most number of books in the
New Testament. Mother, I like to be a writer like St. Paul.
St. Paul was a distinguished writer, who did a wonderful service during the
Apostolic Era. Out of the twenty one letters in the New Testament, the authorship
of thirteen letters belongs to St. Paul. Those letters were written to various people
and communities. This shows the leadership and the relationship which St. Paul had
with them.
Purposes of the Pauline Epistles
1. Difficulty in visiting the Christian communities due to the busy
work.
When St. Paul couldn’t meet personally any of his community he used to guide
them through a letter. Through these letters he was able to give them advice,
deepen their faith and solve their problems. These letters had theological and
pastoral advice.
2. Inability to visit the Christian communities due to his
imprisonment.
Because of his imprisonment, St. Paul couldn’t visit Christian communities.
Therefore, he communicated with them through letters. Examples:
1. The Letter to Colossians was written in the prison, and St. Paul was able to
guide and correct the people of Colossi who were mislead by false teachers.
2. The Letter to Philippians was written, when St. Paul was jailed in Rome.
Through this letter St. Paul wanted to plead and ask from Philippians to be
firm in their faith.
3. A personal letter to a faithful man, named Philemon was also written, while
he was in jail in Rome.
The classification of Pauline Letters
1. Letters written by St. Paul
There are seven letters, written by St. Paul himself. They are: Letters to
Romans, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians
and Philemon.
2. Deutero Pauline Letters
Deutero Pauline Letters were written by others but they have the ideas of
St. Paul. There are three Deutero Pauline Letters, namely Ephesians and
Colossians and 2 Thessalonians.
3. Pseudonymous Authorship
These letters were neither written by St. Paul nor they contain the ideas of St.
Paul. There are three such letters, namely 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy and Titus.
Other Letters
There are eight Letters in the New Testament, named as "Other Letters".
Except the letter to Hebrews, other Seven letters were written by the apostles of
Our Lord, namely Peter, John, Jude and James. These letters can be referred as
“Catholic Epistles” which means “Universal Epistles” or “Common Epistles.”

Look at the above two stanzas. Can you understand the first one at the first sight?
What is the difference between the two stanzas? When you think deeply you will
understand that certain words have been changed to make it difficult for you to
understand.
There are two books in the Holy Bible, which were written with symbols. These
two books are named as Apocalyptic Literature. They are:
1. Book of Daniel
2. Book of Revelation
in the Old Testament
in the New Testament
Let us inquire about some common Symbols
Picture 4.1 - Pedestrian Crossing
Picture 4.2 - The Burring Bush
Identifying and acting according
to this symbol help to protect and
prevent from accidents.
It shows the Divine presence of God.
This symbolizes God’s love and obedience of Jesus
Christ (Rom 5:8, Philip 2:8). Cross is a sign of
our salvation. It is not an ornament to wear, but a
venerable and sacred thing. Beside the cross, we
Christians have other religious symbols. We have to
use them with honour and respect.
Accordingly:
* Symbols are important in communication.
* Every sign or a symbol has a special
Picture 4.3 - Cross
meaning.
* One who does not know the meaning of a symbol, cannot understand the message
or give a proper response to that.
The background and the purpose of the Apocalyptic
Literature.
The meaning of the Greek word, used for “Apocalypse” is, “manifestation or
revelation of a hidden thing.” When prophecy was fading from the Israelite’s society,
Apocalyptic literature replaced it. So the purpose of the Apocalyptic literature was
to strengthen and encourage the people, especially during a period of persecution.
eg. Book of Daniel
Characteristics
Apocalyptic Literature
Dualism
Eschatology
Symbolism
Pseudonymity
1. Dualism
It is the struggle between the forces of good and that of evil.
2. Eschatology
Eschatology is that God will intervene in the future on behalf of his faithful, the
good and bring victory to them. Until such time, it invites the faithful to endure
the hardships and sufferings and live according to their faith. Therefore, we have
to keep in mind, that we could enjoy the heavenly bliss, if we bear the hardships,
obstacles and problems patiently in our lives.
3. Symbolism
Apocalyptic Symbolism is used for two purposes.
i. To avoid the opponents to understand this literature: If it gets into their hands
it helps to protect the faithful by evading the enemies to understand what was
written in the literature.
ii. As a result, it protects the good from the forces of evil.
Sometimes these symbols are simple and other time they are complex.
Let us identify some of the Symbols of Apocalyptic Literature

Picture 4.5 - Dragon
Lamb - Christ (Revelation Ch. 5)
Dragon/beast - Satan/evil forces

4. Pseudonymous Authorship
This helps to protect the author and it makes the book acceptable to the reader. To
emphasize the value of the message and to popularize the book, the authorship is
given to a great person.
eg: 1. The Book of Daniel was written in the period of bitter persecution of Jews,
carried by Antiochus IV Epiphanes in 167-164 B.C. But the book take its
name from its hero, a young Jew called Daniel, who lived around 580 B.C.
2. Book of Revelation was written to encourage and strengthen the Christians
and to preserve their faith during the bitter persecution, carried out by
Roman Emperor, Domitian in 80-96 A.D. the persecution was carried out
against Christians who believed only in one God and refused to worship the
Roman Emperor as their God. The authorship of the Book of Revelation is
attributed to St. John, the evangelist.
Activity
1. Name the four characteristics of the Apocalyptic Literature.
2. Describe briefly, the above mentioned characteristics.
For life
• Wear a blessed cross or a medal.

5 Wisdom Literature
Nimal and Kamal were good friends, who studied in the same school. As a young
boy Nimal’s idea was to become a rich person. After his studies, he implemented
wrong ways and means to become very rich in a short time. But Kamal who was
satisfied with his job lived a peaceful life. One day Nimal said to Kamal with a
painful heart, even with all his luxurious things, he is not enjoying his life very
much.
With wisdom Kamal was able to live a righteous life by choosing a peaceful and
correct path. He experienced success and happiness, because of his correct choice.
Identifying goodness from evil and avoiding evil from our life is wisdom.
King Solomon went to Gibeon to offer sacrifices because that was the principal
high place. Upon it’s altar, Solomon offered thousand holocausts. In Gibeon, the
Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream at night.
Ask what I should give you.
Solomon :
You have shown great and steadfast love to your servant my
father David, because he walked before you in faithfulness, in
righteousness, and in uprightness of heart toward you; and you
have kept for him this great and steadfast love, and have given
him a son to sit on his throne today. And now, O Lord my God, you
have made your servant king in place of my father David, although
I am only a little child; I do not know how to go out or come in.
And your servant is in the midst of the people whom you have
chosen, a great people, so numerous they cannot be numbered or
counted. Give your servant therefore an understanding mind to
govern your people, able to discern between good and evil; for
who can govern this your great people?
Because you have asked this, and have not asked for yourself
long life or riches, or for the life of your enemies, but have asked
for yourself understanding to discern what is right, I now do
according to your word. Indeed I give you a wise and discerning
mind; no one like you has been before you and no one like you
shall arise after you. I give you also what you have not asked,
both riches and honor all your life; no other king shall compare
with you. If you will walk in my ways, keeping my statutes and
my commandments, as your father David walked, then I will
lengthen you life.
(1 Kings 3:4-14)
Holy Scripture explains that king Solomon prayed not for earthly riches, but for
wisdom. Because of that, God gave him long life and wealth too. Wisdom is not
intelligence or passing examinations, but the ability to identify what is good from
evil, and live a good righteous life according to the will of God. Wisdom is a gift
of the Holy Spirit, which we have to pray daily and ask for.

The Aims and spirituality of Wisdom Literature
The main aim or the purpose of Wisdom Literature is not to give knowledge but to
encourage people to live correct and righteous life which pleases God. It gives the
understanding of social administration and purpose of life. It helps to live a fruitful
life, pleasing to God.
Therefore if we want to lead a life of wisdom, we have to choose only goodness in
our day to day life. This can be done only with the divine assistance. For that we
have to pray to God daily.
Trust in the Lord, with all your heart and do
not rely on your own insight. In all your ways
acknowledge him, and he will make straight your
paths.

6 Paschal Mystery
Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ (Luke 22:54-23:25)
Picture 6.1 – Passion of our Lord
After arresting Our Lord Jesus Christ
they led Him to the house of the high
priest. Even though his other disciples
went away, Peter was following at a
distance. In the middle of the courtyard,
what Jesus had said a few hours earlier
about Peter’s denial, became true.
When Peter denied “I do not know
him” for the third time, the Lord turned
and looked at Peter. Peter understood
the silent message that Jesus conveyed
to him. He could not bear it up. Peter
repented for what he had done. He
went out and began to weep bitterly.
The men who arrested Jesus, ridiculed
and beat him. At dawn they brought
him before the Sanhedrin. Their main
question was, “Are you the Messiah?”
but he replied to them. “But from now
on the Son of man will be seated at the
right hand of the power of God.” With
that response they were all aroused
with anger, then the whole assembly
arose and brought him before Pilate.
They brought charges against him,
saying “We found this man misleading
our people; he opposes the payment of
taxes to Caesar and maintains that he is
the Messiah, a king.” After questioning
him for some time, Pilate addressed
the gathering and said that Jesus was
innocent and not guilty. But they were
adamant and accused him more and
more.
On hearing that Jesus was a Galilean,
and upon learning that he was under
Herod’s jurisdiction, Pilate sent Him to
Herod, who was in Jerusalem. At that
time Herod questioned him at length,
but he gave him no answer, because
of that Herod and his soldiers treated
him contemptuously and mocked him,
and clothing him in a elegant robe and
sent him back to Pilate. He summoned
the people and explained that Jesus is
not guilty of the charges that they have
brought against him. But people made
a strong voice to release Barabbas, so
he released the man who had been
imprisoned, and gave the verdict to
crucify Jesus on the Cross.
The Crucifixion of our Lord Jesus Christ (Luke 23:26-56)
Picture 6.2 – Crucifixion of our Lord
Simon, a Cyrenian was the man who
came and helped Jesus to carry his
cross. A large crowd of people followed
Jesus. When they came to the place,
called Skull, they crucified Him and
two other criminals on both sides of
Him. Then Jesus said “Father, forgive
them for they do not know what they
are doing.” While Jesus was on the
cross, they divided his garments by
casting lots. They approached to offer
him wine. They jeered and sneered
at him; above him were written these
words “This is the King of Jews”
One of the criminals, hanging either
sides of Jesus, mocked at him; but
the other one rebuked him and said to
Jesus, “Jesus remember me when you
come into your kingdom.” A firm reply
came from Jesus: “Amen I say to you,
today you will be with me in Paradise”.
Finally, Jesus cried out in a loud voice
“Father, into your hands, I commend
my spirit” and when he had said this
he breathed his last. The darkness
came over the whole land because of
an eclipse of the sun. Then the curtain
of the Temple was torn in to two.
Now there was a good and righteous
man, named Joseph of Arimathea, who
went to Pilate and asked for the body of
Jesus for burial.
Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ (John 20:1-8)
After three days Jesus rose from the
dead. The death of Jesus brought
salvation to all mankind, which was a
promise of God, after the sin of Adam
and Eve.
On the first day of the week, Mary
of Magdala, who went to the Jesus’
tomb became the first witness to His
resurrection.
Picture 6.3 – Resurrection of our Lord
Appearances to the Disciples (John 20:19-20; Luke 24:15-35)
On the first day of the week, which is the day of Our Lord’s resurrection, two
disciples who journeyed from Jerusalem to Emmaus, met a stranger who drew near
and walked with them. On the way even though Jesus explained to them what is
there in the scriptures about his suffering, death and resurrection, their eyes were
kept from recognizing him. But the two disciples seated with Jesus to eat, they saw,
how he took bread, blessed, broke and gave them. Their eyes were opened, they
recognized him.
On the day of His resurrection, He came to His disciples and stood in their midst
and strengthen them by saying “Peace be with you”, at the same time, He breathed
on them, empowered them with the graces of the Holy Spirit, and gave the authority
to forgive sins.
Thomas, the disciple, who was not there, heard about the appearance of Jesus, did
not want to believe what the others said. After 8 days, Jesus appeared again and
reinstated his belief; then Thomas proclaimed his faith in the Risen Lord: “My
Lord, and My God.”
New Heaven and New Earth
Genesis 1:1
“In the beginning
God created the
heaven and earth”.
Revelation 21:1
“Then I saw a New
heaven and a New earth.
The former heaven and
former earth had passed
away.”
Revelation 22:13
“I am the Alpha and the
Omega, the First and the
Last”.
To prepare a worthy place for mankind, in the beginning God created heaven and
earth and also everything and saw it was good. Man who lives a good life under
this heaven and on this earth, will inherit the Eternal life. It is the New Heaven and
New Earth, which God prepared for his children. Jesus’ resurrection is the fortaste
of that heavenly bliss; therefore we must prepare and strive ourselves to live a holy
and righteous life, like Jesus Christ, and inherit that Eternal life.
We will be fortunate to see the Risen Lord, who is in His glory in heaven. By leaving
our sinful actions, living a life with constant prayer and sacrifices and receiving
sacraments, let us prepare ourselves to enter worthily into the New Heaven and
New Earth.

7 The Early Christian Community
Picture 7.1 – The Descent of the Holy Spirit upon
the Apostles and Mother Mary
The Pentecost (Acts 2:1-13)
Other than the Passover feast the most
significant feast, is “Pentecost”, which
means “Fifty”. It is a thanksgiving
feast. After they collected their harvest,
the Jews offered their first fruits to
God to show their gratitude and with
this feast they also commemorated
receiving of the Ten Commandments
on Mount Sinai. Because of these
important incidents, most of the Jews,
who lived in other territories around
Judea came to the Temple of Jerusalem
as pilgrims to celebrate the feast of
Pentecost.
Before the Ascension, Jesus Christ
promised to His disciples and Apostles,
to send the Holy Spirit to empower
them. With that hope Mother Mary
and the disciples gathered together
and prayed for ten days from the day
of the Ascension. On the day of the
Pentecost, while they were praying,
suddenly there came a sound like the
rush of a violent wind. Then there
appeared on them tongues of fire. (Acts
2:1-8). Those symbols represented the
advent of the Holy Spirit, which was
the promise of Jesus Christ. When
they filled with the Holy Spirit, they
began to speak in different tongues.
At this moment, the lives of disciples
changed radically. They all went out
courageously as witnesses of the Word
of God.

Peter’s speech on the day of Pentecost and it’s outcome (Acts
2:14-41)
the Temple of
Jerusalem, people who listened to
the maiden speech of St. Peter were
astonished because the apostles spoke
in different tongues. The apostles, filled
with the Holy Spirit, boldly started
their mission as mature Christians. On
the Pentecost day in his speech, Peter
strongly said, “Jesus was the Son of
God, who was crucified by the people
of Israel. But God had raised him from
death and exalted at the right hand of
God.”
got prepared himself with a thorough
training with his arms and armour. In
the same way a Christian who is filled
with the Holy Spirit, should also be
ready to fight against the challenges,
which comes against their faith.
3000 people who listened to St. Peter’s
speech, repented and were baptized.
From that day onwards Lord added
to their number with the baptized.
The “Pentecost” is the birthday of the
Church. Led by the Holy Spirit, St.
Peter proclaimed about Jesus to a pagan
centurion, working for the battalion of
Italy, named Cornelius and his family,
they believed and asked Peter to baptize
them. (Acts 10:1-8, 44-48)
This boldness of St. Peter is a challenge
to anyone, who does not want to be a
witness to Jesus Christ. Anyone who
receives Holy Spirit, becomes a soldier
of Christ. Soldier is a person who has
Characteristics of the Early Christian Community (Acts 2:42-
47;4:32-37)
Filled with the Holy Spirit, the Early Christian community increased day by day. It
had the following distinguished characteristics:
1. Teachings of the Apostles
2. Communal life (fellowship)
3. Breaking of Bread (Holy Mass)
4. Prayer.
Because of their life style, day by day people joined to the Church and the church
expanded. They had to face a problem in distributing daily needs of the poor and
orphans. So the twelve called together the community of disciples and agreed to
appoint seven “Deacons” (Acts 6:1-7). Those seven Deacons should have following
qualities:
• They should be righteous and reputable.
• They should be filled with the Holy Spirit.
• They should be filled with wisdom.
Apostles laid their hands on deacons' heads, prayed over them and assigned them
with their responsibilities. Thereafter Apostles were able to preach the Good News
without any distraction. The deacons were devoted for their daily distribution and
gave their support to the Apostles.
Witness given by St. Stephen (Acts 6:8-15)
St. Stephen was not only a deacon but also a preacher of Good News. He was
killed by stoning. He was the first martyr of the Church.
St. James, the Great (Acts 12:1-12
St. James, the Great was the first apostle who became a martyr . He was beheaded
by Herod Agrippa I in 44 A.D.
The followers of Jesus were able to sacrifice their lives as martyrs because as sol-
diers of Christ, they were filled with the Holy Spirit and became mature enough to
witness to their Lord. When we receive the Sacrament of Confirmation, we too will
be filled with the Holy Spirit to witness to our faith amidst challenges.

God gives various vocations
different people to accomplish His
divine plan. St. Paul, who received a
vocation, dedicated his whole life for
God’s service.
He was born in Tarsus, of the tribe of
Benjamin. He was a Roman citizen
because his father was a citizen of
Rome. He studied under a famous
teacher of Jerusalem, whose name was
Gamaliel. He had a deep knowledge
on cultural heritage of Judaism
and the Law of Moses. Before he
received his vocation, Paul stood for
Judaism. Therefore he persecuted the
Christians. It was mentioned in Acts
8:1-3. Paul was happy at the stoning
of St. Stephen. By that time he had
not recognized the Living Christ.

Christians with the permit of the

nearing
to Damascus, unexpected
light flashed around him and he fell on
the ground. When he got up from the
ground, and opened his eyes, he could
not see anything. Risen Lord spoke
to him and led him to change his life.
In Damasus after Ananias had given
baptism to him, Paul was able to get his
sight once again (Acts 9:1-19).
From then on St. Paul was a great
missionary. He dedicated himself for
very difficult tasks to spread the church
from Asia minor to Greece and Rome.
Because of this, Paul is called “The
Apostle of Gentiles”.
During his missionary journeys he
had to face a lot of challenges and
difficulties, such as, imprisonment,
stoning, dragging out of the city,
receiving accusation from Jews, etc.
Paul was able to face those challenges
and over come all difficulties by the
power of the Holy Spirit. While he was
doing his missionary work St. Paul did
not get discouraged.
St. Paul wrote letters for various reasons
to different Churches that he had
established. The reasons are, to solve
the problems of different Churches, to
advice them to deepen their faith and
to encourage to do their duties, to keep
up their new life in Christ, to solve and
giving answers to the questions which
erupted about the second coming of
Jesus.

Last Days of St. Paul
After his third missionary journey, St.
Paul stayed in Jerusalem. Because of
the accusations aimed at him by the
Jews who came from Asia, St. Paul
was taken into custody, while he was
in the Temple of Jerusalem. Like
Jesus Christ, Paul also had to face the
judgements of several people. St. Paul
was a Roman citizen and therefore
demanded the judgement of the Roman
Emperor. Thus, he was sent to Rome
as a prisoner.

9 St. Peter
Call of St. Peter (Luke 5:1-11)
One day at the lake of Gennesaret
Jesus got into the boat of Siman
Peter, and preached the message
of God to people. After He had
finished His sermon, He said
to Simon Peter, “Put out into
deep water and lower your nets
for a catch”. Peter obeyed, and
said that they had been working
hard all night but couldn’t catch
any; but if Jesus says, he will do
so. Peter and his brother were
amazed, when they caught a great
number of fish. They couldn’t
fill the catch to their boat, so they
signalled, and call the other boats
too. By seeing these wonderful
catch, Peter was astonished and he
Picture 8.1 - St. Peter
felt down on his knees in front of Jesus, and accepted his sinfulness. Then Jesus
said to Peter, “Do not be afraid, from now on you will be catching men”. At the
same time, Jesus invited Peter to follow him. Peter and his brother, Andrew left
everything and followed Jesus. Another pair of brothers, John and James, the sons
of Zebedee joined Peter and Andrew and followed Jesus.
Peter's Confession about Jesus (Matthew 16:13-16)
One day Jesus was in the village of Caesarea Philippi. He asked his disciple “Who
do people say that I am? They gave different answers. Then He said to them, “But
who do you say that I am?” Simon Peter said boldly “You are the Messiah, the Son
of the living God.” Then Jesus said to him:
Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah. For flesh and blood
has not revealed this to you, but my heavenly Father.
And so I say to you, you are Peter, and upon this rock I
will build my Church and the gates of the Hades shall not
prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom
of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth, shall be bound in
heaven; and whatever you loose on earth, shall be loosed
in heaven.
(Matthew 16:17-19)
The words “Blessed are you”, were said to Simon, who was called by Jesus as
Peter, which means “Rock” By these words, Jesus meant that Peter will be the
solid foundation of the Church. St. Peter was appointed to hold “the Keys of the
Kingdom”. St. He got the authority to open and shut the doors of the Kingdom and
also he got the authority of binding and loosing, which meant to forgive the sins
and teaching the faith and the morals. That is how, Jesus had appointed Peter as the
head of the Church.
Jesus gave three fold tasks to St. Peter (John 21:15-19)
Jesus
“Simon,
son of
John do you love
me more

“Yes, Lord, you know
that I love you”
“Tend my sheep”
“Lord you know ev-
erything, you know
that I love you.
“Feed my sheep”
St. Peter professed thrice his love for
Jesus. He became the shepherd of His
flock, and took the responsibility to feed
the Church, the flock of Jesus. Today

St. Peter, as the Head of the Church.

Catholic Church, is also known as the
“Holy Father”

the Bishop of Rome, head the Catholic
Church in continuous succession. Pope
has the power and honour more than
the other bishops. When a new pope
is appointed to the Holy See, he takes
another name. He is not obliged to any
power in this world. As the members
of the Church, we should obey the rules

10 Characteristics of the Holy
Church
During the Sunday holy mass, when we profess the “Creed” we say, “I believe in
the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church.” This Article of faith, enumerates
the most important and essential characteristics of the Church.
1. One
2. Holy
3. Catholic
4. Apostolic
1. The Church is One
The “One” means the unity of the
Church. The source of this unity is the
Holy Trinity, Father, Son and the Holy
Spirit. All the members of the Church,
have been called by God the Father,
all of them belong to Jesus Christ; all
are fulfilled with the Holy Spirit. This
unity can be explained by the concept
of “Mystical Body of Christ.” Jesus
Christ is the head of this Mystical
Body, all those who are baptized are
the members of that body.
If the parts of the body get separated
from its head or its body, body will
become disfigured or deformed (1Cor.
12:13).
From the beginning there have been
obstacles against this unity. Where
there is sin, there are divisions, heresies
and conflicts. It is the bounden duty of
priests, religious and laity to pray and
secure the unity of the Church. Jesus
also prayed for the unity of the Church.
I ask not only on hehalf of these, but also on behalf of those who will
believe in me through their word, that they may all be one. As you,
Father, are in me and I in you, they also may be in us, so that the world
may believe that you have sent me.
(John 17:20-21)
2. The Church is Holy
A person or thing is holy to the extent that he or it is related to God.
eg: Holy Land, Holy Bible, Holy Pictures, Holy Rosary, Sacred Vessels, Holy
Church. All these things are sacred or holy, because they have some connection to
the Holy Trinity.
Established by Christ
Holy Catholic
Church
Sanctifies and led by Holy Spirit
Called by God
Because of this relationship, the Church is holy. Its holiness cannot be lost. But we
sin. So the Church embraces the sinners and call them to repent. So we must repent
and get our sins absolved.
3. The Church is Catholic or Universal
The Church is Catholic or universal, because she is not limited to one country or one
province. The Catholicity of the Church is twofold.
1. The Church is Catholic because Christ is present in her.
2. The Church is Catholic because she had been sent out by Christ on a mission to
the whole of human race.
The universality of the Church develops only when the good news had been spread
throughout the world and to all ages. Because of that, the Church is missionary. We
are to spread the word of God. It makes Church more catholic, i.e. universal.
4. The Church is Apostolic
The Church is apostolic, because of the identity or her close relationship and the
mission, that she has with the Apostles. When the Church conform to the faith,
the lifestyle and the missionary mandate of the Apostles she becomes Apostolic,
because she was built on the foundation of the Apostle. Apostle is “the one who has
been sent.”

11 Sri Lankan Catholic Church
But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come
upon you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in
all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.
(Acts 1:8)
The above invitation of Jesus also got realized when the good news of our Lord
reached to our country. Catholic History of Sri Lanka can be divided into five eras.
1. Before the Portuguese Period
2. Portuguese Period
3. Dutch Period
4. British Period
5. The Period After the National Freedom
Before 1505 A.D.
1505 – 1658 A.D.
1658 – 1796 A.D.
1796 – 1948 A.D.
After 1948 A.D.
1. Before the Portuguese Period (Before 1505 A.D.)
Picture 11.1 - The Cross found in 1912 in Anuradhapura
According to the book, Topographia Christiana, written by Cosmos Inodicopleutus
in the 6th Century, i.e. before the Portuguese arrived in Sri Lanka, there were
Christians in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka.
In 1912, a stone on which a cross was engraved has been found in
Anuradhapura. It is believed that it is similar to the cross, used by the disciples of
St. Thomas, the Apostle.
There are different opinions among the learned that there had been Christians
in Sri Lanka before the 6th century. It is at the level of discussion.
When Sri Lankan coastal area was under Portuguese rule, it was the
missionaries and their companions who made a formal effort to spread Christianity
in the Island and to establish Catholic Church in Sri Lanka.
2. Portuguese Period (1505 – 1658 A.D.)
By chance the Portuguese came to Sri Lanka on 15th November 1505 A.D. They came
only for trade, but King Buwaneka Bahu VII, the king of Kotte got them involved
in politics. As requested by the king in 1543, a team of Franciscan Missionaries
came to Sri Lanka and got involved in the missionary work enthusiastically.
After the Kingdom of Kotte came under the reign of Portuguese, missionaries of
different Congregations were sent to Sri Lanka to serve the Catholics of Sri Lanka.
Jesuits missionaries
Dominicans missionaries
Augustinians missionaries
Most of them got involved in Catechesis and also did their missionary work and
other charitable services. They gave priority to education.
3. Dutch Period (1658 – 1796 A.D.)
The Dutch period was a time of persecution for the Catholics who lived in the
coastal areas of Sri Lanka. All the Catholic priests were expelled from the country.
All Catholics were prohibited to practise Catholicism. All the Catholic Churches,
schools and charitable institutions were taken over by the Dutch and handed over
by the protestant priests, and some of them were demolished or destroyed. In every
school they taught Protestantanism to each and every child. The parents who did
not send their children to those schools were taxed. They did not accept marriages
which were not solomnized in the Protestant Churches. Out of all these difficulties,
things the main problem, faced by the Catholics was, the abscence of a Catholic
priest among them to receive Sacraments. In the midst of all these challenges, Sri
Lankan Catholics protected their faith for about 30 years without a priest.
Those who migrated to the kingdom of Kandy, got some kind of freedom, but
they neither had a priest nor a Church for their religious practices. In 1687 A.D.
God’s messenger was sent to Sri Lanka to rescue the Catholics from this unpleasant
situation. He is none other than St. Joseph Vaz who came from India to rekindle the
faith of the Sri Lankan Catholics.
St. Joseph Vaz, The Apostle of Sri Lanka
Meaning of the Hymn in honour of St. Joseph Vaz
Picture 11.2 - St. Joseph Vaz
Chorus -
O most ven’rable, O most laudable
Joseph Vaz…faithful apostle, servant and priest of God,
By your brave and fearless love – to our rescue you came,
Preaching the word – bringing the light of Christ to our motherland.
1. You came in search of those who were – Involved in sin and shame,
A shepherd true you daily toiled – With love of God inflamed,
Teaching people the true faith – And feeding them with true bread,
Your saintly life has won for us – Fresh dawn of Grace in Christ.//
Chorus
2. You walked the length and breadth of land–Through forests hills and plains,
Donning the garb of mendicants – Suffering you bore and pain,
Teaching people the true faith – And feeding them with true bread,
Your saintly life has won for us – Fresh dawn of Grace in Christ.//
Chorus
3 The thoughts and ways led every men – go after earthly pleasures,
Social status, money and power–which make them enslave to the world,
You destroyed all men’s desires – and won for them eternal joy,
The love you shed safe guard the faith – of Christ’s heavenly grace.//
Chorus
St. Joseph Vas was born on the 21st of April 1651 A.D. in a small village called
Sancoale, Goa a, highly populated Catholic area of Western India. Though
a Brahamin by caste, his family bore Portuguese name Vaz. His parents were
Christopher Vaz and Maria Miranda. Since from his childhood, he was pious and
devout and was ordained as a priest in 1676. He heard about the pathetic situation
of Sri Lankan Catholics. Fr. Joseph Vaz was trying to find a way to enter Sri Lanka
by avoiding the Dutch soldiers, guarding the coastal belt of Sri Lanka. God’s plan
worked. Being an Oratorian priest, he disguised himself as a labourer, and came to
Mannar by a trade ship.
He came to an unknown land, to serve an unknown people without knowing a
single word of their language. From that day till his death he dedicated his life to
go in search of helpless Catholics. He did a commendable service without thinking
about his comforts.
St. Joseph Vaz had performed number of Miracles
* Miracle of rain in Kandy during the severe draught.
* Walked across the Deduru Oya, when there were strong currents.
* Taming a rogue elephant in the forest.
Father Joseph Vaz was able to win the hearts of the people, as well as the Kandyan
king, Vimala Dharmasuriya II. They were fascinated by his kind hospitality and
care to the patients, who suffered from the small-pox epidemic. He walked on
barefoot through forests, hills and plains to serve the people. He led a simple
exemplary life and lived in poverty. To expanded his services to different places,
he appointed lay leaders like Annavi, Muhuppu, Sacristans. He served in North,
South and Central parts of Sri Lanka with all the difficulties. He died on the 16th
January 1711 A.D., when he was at the age of 60. Out of 35 years of his priestly
life, he served 24 years to our motherland, Sri Lanka. At the last moment of his
life, the fellow priests begged Fr. Joseph Vaz to give them an advice that might be
useful for the rest of their lives. St. Joseph Vaz said in Sinhalease. “No one can
realize a task at the time of his death what he has ignored during his life time.”
This was his last advice. A happy day was dawned to Sri Lankan Catholics, when
His Holiness Pope John Paul II (Saint John Paul II) beatified Father Joseph Vaz on
the 21st January 1995. His Holiness Pope Francis canonized him on 14th January
2015 when he visited Sri Lanka.
Rev. Father Jacome Gonsalvez
In 1705 A.D. Father Jacome Gonsalvez came to
Sri Lanka. With the guidance of St. Joseph Vaz,
he had written several books in Sinhala and Tamil
languages; some of them are Deva Veda Puranaya,
Veda Kavyaya, Pasan Potha and Mangala Geethaya.
Sri Lankan Catholic Church is truly grateful to
Father Jacome Gonsalvez for his pioneering efforts
in inculturation and his contribution to Sri Lankan
Catholics literature, drama, poetry and music. He
died on 17th July 1742 and was buried in Bolawatta
Church.
Picture 11.3 - Fr. Jacome
Gonsalvez
4. British Period
In 1796 after handing over the areas to the British, which were under the Dutch rule,
British were able to broaden their reign from coastal area to the whole island by
1815. They lifted up the ban on Catholicism and gave freedom to all religions,
allowing all to practise their own faith in Sri Lanka.
During this era some religious congregations came to serve in Sri Lanka:
Order of Sylvestro Benedictines
Oblates of Mary Immaculate
Society of Jesus (Jesuits)
De Salle Brothers
Marist Brothers
Holy Family Sisters
Good Shepherd Sisters .
Franciscan Missionaries of Mary
Little Sisters of the Poor
5. The Period After the National Freedom (After 1948)
After independence in 1948, the most difficult problem, faced by the Sri Lankan
Catholic Church was the take over of the Catholic schools by the government in
`1961. Because of that, the religious environment which was prevalent in the
school education was lost. Teaching of religion in schools was limited to two
periods. The responsibility and authority of administering the Catholic schools,
such as recruiting teachers and giving appointments for them were done by the
government. The Catholic identity and the environment in our school system were
lost gradually. In the decade of 1960 all the missionaries who had come from
abroad, had to leave our motherland due to non-renewal of visas.
After the independance local Archbishops and Bishops were appointed.
Some of them have already have gone to their reward in heaven. Some of them are
retired.

12 The Holy Eucharist
Picture 12.1 - Last Supper
When the hour has come for Jesus
to depart from this world on Holy
Thursday at the Last Supper, Lord
Jesus instituted the Holy Eucharist in
order to stay with us forever. Then
He told the apostles to do it over and
over again in rememberence of Him.
Through the Holy Sacrifice of the
Mass, it is being perpetuated to the end
of the world. Jesus is truly alive in the
HolyEucharist.
In the Catholic liturgy, the central
place is given to the Holy Eucharist
because the living Jesus is present in it.
Therefore, it is called “the Sacrament
of all the Sacraments.” Jesus offers
Himself as a sacrifice to the heavenly
Father and nourishes us with His own
body and blood through the Sacrament
of Holy Eucharist.
Characteristics of the Holy Eucharist
1. Holy Eucharist is a Sacrament
On Holy Thursday at the Last Supper, Jesus instituted this most august Sacrament
where He is really and truly present.
2. It is a meal
“Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life, and I will raise
them up on the last day, for my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink.
Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood abide in me and I in them” (John
6: 54-56). We receive the flesh and the blood of Jesus sacramentally in the
Eucharist.
3. It is a sacrifice
He took a loaf of bread, and when he had given thanks, He broke it and gave it to
them saying “This is my body which is given for you. Do this in remembrance
of me.” And he did the same with the cup after supper saying “This cup that
is poured out for you is the new covenant with my blood” (Luke 22:19-20).
4. It is a Covenant
In the same way He took the cup after supper saying, “This cup is the new
covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me”
(1 Corinthians 11:25).
5. It is a thanksgiving
Then He took the cup and after giving thanks He said, “Take this and divide it
among yourselves; for I tell that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the
vine until the kingdom of God comes” (Luke 22:17).
Then He took a loaf of bread, and when He had given thanks, He broke it and
gave it to them, saying, “This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in
remembrance of me” (Luke 22:19).
6. It is a remembrance
When He had given thanks, He broke it and said “This is my body that is for
you. Do this in remembrance of me” (1 Corinthians 11:24).
Those who partake of the Eucharistic meal, live in Christ and Christ Jesus lives in
them forever. We who receive Jesus, become one body. That is the Mystical Body
of Christ and it is the Holy Church. Therefore, we too like Jesus should be ready
always to break ourselves and give ourselves for others. We must selflessly work
for the betterment of others and should work for the development of the Church.
We must be always ready to perpetuate Christ’s sacrifice on the cross and be sharers
of His Sacrifice.
The Names in the New Testament for the Holy Sacrifice of
the Mass
1. Breaking of Bread
“Then they told what had happened on the road, and he had been made known
to them in the breaking of bread” (Luke 24:35).
“They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and fellowship, to the
breaking of bread and prayers” (Acts 2:42).
2. The Lord’s Supper
When you come together, it is not really to eat the Lord’s Supper that you eat.
(1 Corinthians 11:20).
3. New Festival of Easter
Therefore let us celebrate the festival, not with the old yeast, the yeast of malice
and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth (1 Corinthians
5:8).
4. Sharing of Body and Blood of Christ
The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a sharing in the blood of Christ? The
bread we break, is it not a sharing in the Body of Christ? (1 Corinthians 10:16)
Prefigurations of the Holy Eucharist
 Sacrifice of King, Melchizedek
Priest¡king, Melchizedek of Salem brought out bread and wine for the first time
offered a sacrifice to Almighty God; he was priest of God Most High (Genesis
14:18-20).
 Manna from Heaven
Then the Lord said to Moses “I am going to rain bread from heaven for you, and
each day the people shall go out and gather enough for the day” (Exodus 16: 4).
 The First Passover meal
In rememberence of leaving Egypt in haste and escaping from salvory, Israelites
had a meal of unleavened bread and drank wine from the cup (Exodus 12:15-20).
 The Miracle of the Multiplication of Loaves
All the four evangelists mention this miracle in their Gospels. This is the only
miracle that is recorded in all the four Gospels (Mathew 14:15-21, Mark 6:35-
44, Luke 9: 12-17, John 6:5-13). The basic characteristics found in the Holy
Mass is found in this miracle. “He took the bread, gave thanks, broke it and
gave it to them.”
 The teaching, “I am the bread of life”
“I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry, and whoever
believes in me will never be thirsty (John 6:35).
We, who receive the Holy Eucharist, believe that Jesus is really and truly present
in the Holy Eucharist. The miracle that took place in Lanciano in Italy is a good
example that Jesus is alive and truly present in the Holy Eucharist.
Eucharistic Miracle at Lanciano
In the year 800 A.D. in the city of Lanciano,
Italy, one of the monks, a priest priest said
mass in the little chapel, consecrated to St.
Legontian. He often had a doubt whether
the host and the wine were transformed into
the body and blood of Christ at the words of
consecration during Mass. One day during
Mass, when he pronounced the words of
consecration, the white host became a lump
of flesh and the wine turned into human
blood. This lump of flesh and the blood are
preserved in a special vessel in the chapel of
Lanchiano.
Picture 12.2 - Blessed Sacrament
In 1574 and 1970 scientific experiments were done on the lump of flesh and blood.
It was revealed that the lump of flesh belongs to a human body and it was taken
from the heart muscle and the blood belongs to AB positive blood group. It contains
proteins, calcium, potassium and other substance that a living human beings blood
has. Though that piece of flesh and blood were open to environmental conditions
for than twelve centuries, they remain intact.
In 1978 the NASA Institute carried out a scientific experiment on the Holy Shroud
of Turin. It was revealed that the blood that was on the Holy Shroud belong to AB
positive blood group. It was a wonderful revelation that the same kind of blood is
found both in the Holy Shroud of Turin and the lump of flesh at Lanciano.
The duty of all our Catholics is to participate in the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass with
enthusiasm, faith and love. By receiving Holy Communion whenever possible, we
are able to have a closer union with Jesus, and we receive spiritual nourishment
which helps us for our journey towards heaven. We must genuflect and adore the
Holy Eucharist especially when Blessed Sacrament is exposed. We must pray
individually and as a group before the Blessed Sacrament. Let us increase our faith
in Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament.

13 Paschal Meal
Picture 13.1 Exodus
Paschal Meal in the Old Testartament
Son :
Mama, is there any festival at our home today?
Mama:
Yes, son, today is the Paschal Feast. For us, Jews, it is a very important
feast.
Son :
What is this Paschal Feast, Mama?
Mama:
Son :
Mama:
Alright son, now listen well. One day I told you that once upon a
time our forefathers lived as slaves in Egypt. As slaves they had to
undergo a lot of suffering.”
What did they do as slaves?
They had to do hard labour with mortar and brick and every kind of
field labour. They were forced to do very heavy work which made
their lives very bitter. They oppressed them with forced labour and
got them to build supply cities. God saw all their sufferings and
oppression and delivered them from their suffering. God chose Moses
to bring them back to the Promised Land.
Son :
Was it possible for Moses to do that, Mama?
Mama:
Son :
Mama:
Yes, son, God chose Moses and sent him to king Pharaoh of Egypt.
God sent Aaron to help him. God was with them to strengthen them.
Today is the Paschal Feast. For us Jews, it is a very important feast.
Then did king Pharaoh release the Jewish people?
No, my son. For that God sent them ten plagues. The last and the
tenth plague was to kill the first born male. Beginning from the king
Pharaoh’s first born son, all the first born sons of Egyptians died.
Even the first born of livestock died. There was great mourning and
wailing in the Land of Egypt
Son :
Then Mama, what happened to Israelites?
Mama:
Nothing happened to Israelites. God had given instructions about
this to Moses on the previous day. According to that, they killed a
lamb and smeared its blood on the two doorposts and the lintel. They
roasted over the fire and ate it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
They did not leave any of its remains until the following morning.
They burnt what was lett behind before the morning. Then God gave
them a command. “This day shall be a day of remembrance for you.
You shall celebrate it as a festival to the Lord. Throughout all your
generations you shall observe it as a perpetual ordinance (Exodus
12:14).
Son :
Thank you Mama for telling me about the Paschal festival. Now I
can understand it very well.
Once a year Jewish people celebrated the Paschal festival in a grand scale. They
gave a very special place to the Paschal meal. The Paschal lamb had a very important
significance. If a household is too small for the whole lamb it shall join its closest
neighbour. The lamb shall be divided in to proportions according to the number of
people who eat it (Exodus 12:4,8,20).
There are four Essential in the Paschal Meal:
Paschal lamb
Unleavened bread
Bitter herbs
Paschal Meal in the New Testament
The Last Supper of Jesus Christ on Holy
Thursday was a “Paschal meal.” On that
day Jesus instituted the Holy Eucharist, our
eternal Paschal meal. Jesus instituted the Holy
Eucharist so that He can live with us for ever,
and he took the place of the Paschal lamb.
On the following day he gave up his life as
a sacrifice becoming the Paschal lamb in the
New Testament.
Picture 13.2 - Holy Sacrifice of the Mass
Then he took bread and when he had given thanks, he broke it and
gave it to them, saying, “This is my Body which is given for you. Do
this in memory of me.” And likewise the cup after supper, saying.
“This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood.”
(Luke 22:19-20)
Let us make alive the Paschal Sacrifice through the sacrifice of the Mass. Let us
celebrate it till the end of the world.
Washing of the Feet and the Commandment of Love
Picture 13.3
Jesus is washing the feet of the Apostles on Holy Thursday
Although the Synoptic Gospels, namely Mathew, Mark and Luke mention about
the institution of the Holy Eucharist on Holy Thursday at the last supper by Jesus,
St. John Gospel, mentions Jesus' washing the feet of his apostles after the supper on
Holy Thursday. He did this because all those who partake of the body and blood of
Christ must first follow the commandment of love.
Through the physical and spiritual preparation to receive Holy Communion, we
show our love and reverence to Jesus in the Holy Eucharist. St. John reminds the
Christian community something that all must do, but easily forget:
You call me Teacher and Lord: and you are right, for so
I am. If then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your
feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet..............
I give you a new commandment: love one another. As I
have loved you, so you also should love one another.
John 13:13-14,34
Neglecting the love and service, the Christian Community at corinth had taken
part in the breaking of bread. St. Paul tells them that, it is not right to do so. He
admonishes the Church in Corinth:
But in the following instructions I do not
commend you, because when you come
together it is not for the better but for the worse.
For, in the first place, when you assemble as a
church, I hear that there are divisions among
(1 Corinthians 11:17-18)
We must live according to the commandment of love, before we partake of Holy
Communion. If we have sinned against the commandment of love, before we
receive Holy Communion we must be truly sorry for our sins and ask pardon from
God and then only we can receive Holy Communion.
Holy Communion is not only a liturgical act but also a Sacrament of love and
unity. Therefore, Sunday Eucharist is a commemoration of love and service. The
sacrificial life that we lead all throughout the week by sacrificing so many things
generously for others, is mixed with the holy sacrifice of Jesus and offered to our
Heavenly Father.
Hence St. John is inviting all of us to make the holy sacrifice of the Mass more
meaningful by putting love and service into action (as Jesus washed the feet of the
apostles).
The following hymn tell us how beautiful is the love of God and love of our
neighbour.
Love it was that made us
Chorus:
Love it was that made us –
And it was love that saved us
Love was God’s plan, when He made man
God’s divine nature is love
Born of God’s love we must love Him
That’s why He made us to love Him
But only when we love all men
Can we partake of God’s love //
Love is a wonderful thing
Joy in our hearts it will bring
Where there’s true love there is God
And where there’s God there is love.
Christ said: Love must be the sign
By which men will know you are mine
A new commandment I give
Love each other love as I did.
Preparation for Holy Communion
Spiritual Preparation
free of sin
(Hymn Book No. 10)
If you have committed a mortal sin, you cannot receive holy Communion. If so
you must make a good confession before receiving Holy Communion. If you have
committed any venial sins, be sorry for your venial sins at the penitential rite at the
beginning of mass and be a worthy person to receive Holy Communion.
Those, who have committed a mortal sin, have
no opportunity of receiving
the sacrament of
Reconciliation before Communion may receive Holy
Communion with a truly contrite heart for the sin and
with a firm decision to make Confession at the first
opportunity.
(Refer: Canon Law 916)
Bodily Preparation
taking any food or drink
Abstain from
(fasting) at
least one hour before Holy
Communion (medicine and water are allowed)
Activity
1. Write four heavy works that the Israelites had to do in Egypt as slaves.

sacrifice ourselves.
14 Sacrifice of Calvary
Sacrifices in the Old Testament
In the Old Testament, the Israelites’
main and central form of worship
was offering sacrifices to God. For
these sacrifices, they used various
things, such as food and drink. Out
of all these, animal sacrifice was
given prominence, because it was
believed that there was life in the
blood of animals and the life belongs
to God (Liviticus 3:17, 7:26, 17:10,
17:11).
The purpose of offering Sacrifices
• For expiation of sins.
to continue the relationship with God
Two Types of Offerings:
Picture 14.1
Incense sacrifice in the Old Testament
1. Burnt Offerings :-
For this, bulls (Levi. 1:3-9), sheep, goats (Levi. 1: 10-13) and
birds (doves and pigeons) (Levi. 1:14-17) were used.
2. Unburnt :-
Offerings
Food, drink, grain, oil, wine and bread were used.
There were four kinds of burnt offerings
1. Fully Burnt Offering
2. Peace Offering
3. Sin offering
4. Guilt Offering
The Sacrifice of Calvary
All those sacrifices of the Old Testament were brought into fulfilment through the
sacrifice of Jesus Christ on Calvary. There were different kinds of sacrifices in the
Old Testament. But there is only one sacrifice in the New Testament. That is the
Sacrifice of Jesus Christ on Calvary. The Sacrifice of Calvary is the most supreme,
most sublime and eternal sacrifice.
He entered once for all into the Holy Place, taking not the blood
of goats and calves, but his own blood, thus securing an eternal
redemption……..how much more shall the blood of Christ, who
through the eternal Spirit, offered himself without blemish to God,
purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.
(Hebrews 9: 12-14)
into fullness all
Jesus Christ brought
sacrifices of Israelites through his sacrifice on the
cross on the hill of Calvary. That was a perfect
sacrifice. Therefore it is not to be repeated like
the animal sacrifices in the Old Testament. He
also became the High Priest who brought about
the relationship between God and man. Through
the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, He continues the
sacrifice of Calvary to the end of time. Without
shedding blood, it is offered sacramentally on
the altar (Luke 22:17-19).
Through the Sacrifice of the Mass we build up a
deep relationship with God. Hence the life of a
Christian should be a constant sacrifice, offered
to God. Our daily work, joys, sorrows laughter,
Picture 14.2
Consecration of Host and wine
tears and everything should be offered to God with the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass.
By being faithful to our duties and responsibilities, we bear witness to Christ, and
we become useful citizens of our country.
Since we are weak human beings, we tend to fall into sin. In those situations, we
should accept our sinfulness with a contrite spirit and change of heart and then we
should reach the confessional and receive the sacrament of Reconciliation and rise
into a new life with Christ and be united with the sacrifice of Calvary.
In the society we find various types of people namely the sick, the suffering, the
poor, the lonely, the unfortunate, the helpless and sinners. As Christians it is our
duty to help all these people. For this, we have to spend our time, energy, talents and
money. This is a good sacrifice that we offer to God daily. On the last judgement
day this will be the criteria by which we are judged by our just judge, Jesus Christ
(Mathew 25: 41-46).
Activity
Write two purposes of offering sacrifices in the Old Testament.
Mention four things that Jewish people used for unburnt offerings.
Write the two types of offerings.
Give two reasons for the sublimity of sacrifice of Calvary.
Give two instances that you can be a sacrifice for others.
For Life
Try to spend some time in prayer before and after
the Holy Mass.
15 Generous and Exemplary Lives
St. John Paul II
Picture 15.1 - St. John Paul II
He was born in Poland on the 18th of May 1920. His name was Karol Joseph
Wojtyla. He experienced God’s providence even from his mother’s womb and his
life was full of troubles and problems. In the midst of problems, he managed to be
successful in his higher studies. When he was young, he met with a fatal accident.
Surprisingly he recovered. In 1942 he entered the University of Jagilonia. Secretly
he followed a Theology course with four other students, staying in the Bishop’s
House, because he wanted to be a priest. He became a priest in 1946 a Bishop in
1958, a Cardinal in 1967. In 1978 he was elected as the Pope and he took the name
of John Paul II.
As the Pope he has visited 129 countries. He came to Sri Lanka on the 21st of
January 1995 and raised Fr. Joseph Vaz to the state of Blessed. He raised 1823
holy people to the state of Blessed and the Sainthood. He was the first Pope
who visited a Synagogue in 1986 and a mosque in 2001. Invited by the Eastern
Orthodox Bishops he was the first Pope who went to a country where there were a
large number of Non Catholics. During his papacy he wrote 14 Encyclicals, 110
Apostolic Constitutions, 11 Apostolic Exhortations a good number of letters, etc.
He wrote the book “Crossing The Threshold of Hope.” It has been translated into
40 languages and about a million copies have been sold. He had a great devotion to
Mother Mary. It was Pope John Paul II who was responsible in breaking down the
Berlin wall that separated Eastern and Western Germany. He spoke very vehemently
against the rich countries who has taken the poor countries as their prey. On the
the 13th of May 1981 the Turkish named Ali Agca shot him on the stomach. It was
another miracle of Divine Providence that though he was fatally injured, God saved
his life. His Holiness paid him a visit to the prison cell and forgave him. We can
draw so many good examples from his life. He was not discouraged though he was
poor and helpless. He fulfilled his responsibilities even when he was sick. Even
from his childhood, he learnt to bear his sufferings and pain. He spoke bravely
against injustice. He bore witness to Christ all throughout his life. He died on the
2nd of April 2005. He was beatified on the 1st of May 2011 and canonized on the
27th of April 2014.

She was born in Albania on the 26th of August 1910. Her baptismal name was
Agnes. There were three children in the family and she was the youngest. She
had a comfortable life at home and she was quite happy in the family. When she
was seven years old, her father died. Her family had to struggle hard to live and
they had a very hard and sorrowful life, after their father’s death. Agnes saw the
hard and sorrowful life that her mother was undergoing. She was drawn towards

dwellers on either side of the road.
She had a passionate desire to help
those poor and unfortunate people. On
the 17th of August 1948 she received
special permission from Holy Father
and started a new Congregation,
Missionaries of Charity.
Kolkata became a central city where
there is an institution for the destitute,
the helpless, the sick and the dying.
She paved the way for those who are
dying on the road without anybody’s
attention to die a death with human
dignity. She asked the Mayor to give
her a house for the dying so that she
will look after them and help them to
die as human beings with dignity.
She received a home for AIDS patients
St. Maximilian Kolbe
from the Mayor of New York. In 1985
the first house for AIDS patients was
opened in New York. Then she opened
a school for street children. Those
children were very dirty and smelling.

Picture 15.4
Rev. Fr. Michael Rodrigo O.M.I.
he was lecturing and training the Brothers who are preparing for their priesthood.
From there he went to serve the poor farmers of Buttala. He resided in “Subaseth
Gedara” Alukalawita, Buttala. By serving those poor farmers who are marginalised
from society he proved how to become a true disciple of Christ.
By living to those poor people, he experienced Christ’s suffering and sacrifice. He
also showed by living with those people that he was able to live a life of purity and
poverty. He built relationships with the Buddhist clergy.
In a very simple way he made those poor people understand that God is always
present with them and God is the source of all truth, because he bore witness to the
truth.
His service was directed towards the following:
• To make priesthood service oriented
• To solve the problems of the economically and socially poor
• To solve the problems of the youth
• To build religious harmary and cooperation
• To inculturate Sacred Liturgy
• To build a society, based on truth and justice.
He was interested in the following fields:
• He tried to find ways and means to eradicate poverty while living with the
poor and for the poor.
• Raised a voice against injustice, faced by the poor farmers
• His dwelling was a place where the poor could discuss their problems and
find solutions.

16 Love of God
Above every thing
Neighbour
As yourself
The first three commandments
Other seven commandments
First Commandment
You shall have no other gods before me.
Exodus 20:3-6
You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart,
and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and
with all your mind;
Luke 10:27
The first three commandments embraces faith, hope and charity.
Faith
The basis of our faith is God who reveals Himself with love. The ignorance of
God is the main reason for of all moral deviations (Romans 1:18-32). Our duty
toward God is to believe in Him and to bear witness to Him.
Even after leaving school when you go to the society, you must try to increase
your faith in God in parallel to the secular learning. It is a grace, if our daily
activities are in keeping with our faith in God. The first commandment of God
invites us to nourish and protect our faith in God.
“Though Abraham led a shepherdic life, he was
blessed to be called the father of faith.”
faith of Mary who had
face so
many challenges in her life, is a real example
of faith for us.
We cannot grasp everything that is revealed in the Holy Scripture. The knowledge
of an adult cannot be compared to the knowledge of a child. In the same way
wisdom of a man cannot be compared with the divine wisdom. It is foolish to
have faith in the little knowledge and strength that we have.
Since we worship one God:
1. We adore Him
2. We pray to Him
3. We offer sacrifices to Him,
4. We make vows and promises to Him.
Adoration
Adoration is the first act of the virtue of religion. To adore God is to
acknowledge him as God, as the Creator and Saviour, the Lord and
Master of everything that exists, as infinite and merciful Love. “You
shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve” says
Jesus citing Deuteronomy 6:1-3.
To adore God is to acknowledge, in respect and absolute submission,
the “nothingness of the creature” who would not exist but for
God………….The worship of the one God sets man free from
turning in on himself, from the slavery of sin and the idolatry of the
world.
(CCC 2096-2097)
2. Prayer
Picture 16.1 - Unite with God through prayer
The acts of faith, hope and charity enjoined by the first commandment
are accomplished in prayer. Lifting up the mind toward God
is an expression of our adoration to God; prayer of praise and
thanksgiving, intercession and petition. Prayer is an indispensable
condition for being able to obey God’s commandments. “(We)
ought always to pray and not lose heart.”
(CCC 2098)
My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices
in God my Saviour, for he has looked with favour on
the lowliness of his servant. Surely, from now on all
generations will call me blessed,
(Luke 1:46-48)
If we can praise God in all our difficulties like Mother Mary, we can experience
God’s love immensely.
Sacrifice
Picture 16.2 - Jesus sacrificed His life to save man from sin.
It is right to offer sacrifice to God as a sign of adoration and
gratitude, supplication and communion; “ Every action done so
as to cling to God in communion of holiness, and thus achieve
blessedness, is a true sacrifice.”
Outward sacrifice, to be genuine, must be the expression of
spiritual sacrifice. “The sacrifice acceptable to God is a broken
spirit…The prophets of the Old Covenant often denounced
sacrifices that were not from the heart or not coupled with love
of neighbour. Jesus recalls the words of the prophet Hosea. “I
desire mercy, and not sacrifice.” The only perfect sacrifice is
the one that Christ offered on the cross as a total offering to the
Father’s love and for our salvation. By uniting ourselves with his
sacrifice we can make our lives a sacrifice to God.
(CCC 2099 - 2100)
4. Promises and Vows
In many circumstances, the Christian is called to make promises to God. Baptism
Confirmation, Matrimony and Holy Orders always entail promises. Out of
personal devotion, the Christian may also promise to God to do certain things. eg:
to say extra prayers, to give alms, to go on pilgrimages and so forth. Fidelity to the
promises, made to God, is a sign of the respect, owed to the divine majesty, and of
love for a faithful God.
Sins against the first commandment
Honouring false Gods other than only true God
To follow the fundamentalists
Belief in Superstitions
Idolatry
Pagan worship
Atheism - Do not believe in God
Belief in fortune telling
Acting according to auspicious time
Belief in horoscopes and palm reading
Recourse to demonic acts
Interpretation of omens and lots
Belief in Astrology
All practices of magic or sorcery and charms
Interpreting Holy Scripture incorrectly
Offering flowers and fruit baskets at shrines of other religions
Belief that faith in God is a myth
When God reveals Himself and calls, man cannot fully respond to the divine love
by his own power. He must hope that God will give him the capacity to love him.
Sins against hope are:
1. Despair
2. Presumption
1. Despair - Man ceases to hope for his personal salvation is from God and in
attaining forgiveness of sins. It is against God’s goodness.
2. Presumption - Hope of saving himself without the help from God and hope of
obtaining forgiveness without conversion and glory without mercy.
To attain the theological virtue of hope, one must try not to have too much hope
in himself/herself but depend on God and try to submit oneself to the will of God.
When my will is not in keeping with God’s will and when I find it difficult to
submit myself to God’s will I have to do God’s will saying I place myself in your
hands. Then I can experience God’s immense love.
Love - Charity
Love of God is to love the Lord, our only true God with our whole heart whole soul
whole mind and whole strength.
One can sin against God’s love in various ways:
- Indifference – neglects or refuses to reflect on divine
charity; it fails to consider God's goodness
and denies its power.
- Ingratitude – fails or refuses to acknowledge divine
charity.
- Luke warmness – hesitation or negligence in responding to divine love
- Hatred of God – comes from pride. It is contrary to love of God
(CCC 2094)
Second Commandment
You shall not make wrongful use of the name
of the Lord your God, for the Lord will not
acquit anyone who misuses his name.
(Exodus 20:7)
Let us see what the Catechism of the Catholic Church and Holy Scripture say about
this commandment.
Use the name of the Lord with respect
The second commandment prescribes respect of Lord's name.
It forbids false oath. The oaths can be made for grave and right
reasons such as in courts. In such instances, only the truth has
to be said.
The second commandment forbids every improper use of God’s
name. Blasphemy is the use of the name of God in an offensive
way. The holiness of the diving name demands that we should
not use it for trivial matters. The second commandment also
forbids magical use of the divine name. To use God's name to
verify a falsehood is blasphemy.
(CCC 2150-2158)
If in my name you ask me for anything, I
will do it.
(John 14:14)
A Catholic always begins his day, prayers and all activities with the sign of the
cross. “In the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit Amen”. The
sign of the cross strengthens us in temptations and difficulties.
The importance of using a Christian name
The Sacrament of Baptism is conferred “in the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” In Baptism the Lord’s
name sanctifies man and the Christian receives his name in the
church. This can be the name of a saint, that is, of a disciple
who has lived a life of exemplary fidelity to the Lord. The patron
saint provides a model of charity; we are assured of his
intercession. The “baptismal name” can also express a Christian
mystery of Christian virtue.
(CCC 2156)
Sins against the second Commandment
Swearing in God’s name to get material favours.
Justifying one's wrongs and sins as God's will
Cursing others using or without using the name of God
- To speak ill of God
Not witnessing to God
Uttering words of hatred, reproach and ill will against God
Using holy things, Holy Bible, statues ect, without any respect.
I will extol you my God and King and bless
your name forever and ever
Every day I will bless you, and praise your
name for ever and ever.
(Psalms 145:1-2)
Third Commandment
Keep Sunday and the days of obligation holy.
"Remember the Sabbath day and keep it
Holy. .........
(Exodus 20: 8-11)
On Sunday we gather in churches for Eucharist. During the Eucharistic celebration,
mysteries of salvation are taught and invited to live a life of good conduct and that
of fraternal charity and love.
To keep Sunday holy the first duty that we have to do is to participate in the holy
Mass.
Picture 16. 3 - Celebrating Mass

17 A Society of Love
Listen to me, your father, O children;
act accordingly, that you may be kept in safety
For the Lord honours a father above his children,
and he confirms a mother’s right over her children.
Those who honour their father atone for sins,
and those who respect their mother are like those who
lay up a treasure.
Those who honour their father will have joy in their own children,
and when they pray they will be heard.
Those who respect their father will have long life,
and those who honour their mother obey the Lord;
they will serve their parents as their masters.
Honour your father by word and deed,
that his blessing may come upon you.
For a father’s blessing strengthens the house of the children,
but a mother’s curse uproots their foundations.
Do not glorify yourself by dishonouring your father,
for your father’s dishonour is no glory to you.
(Sirach 3: 1-10)
The Fourth Commandment: Honour your Father and
your Mother
Honour your father and your mother so that your
days may be long in the land that the Lord your
God is giving you.
(Exodus 20:12)
Home is a holy place, because Jesus was born to a family and he lived in a
family. The Holy Family is the best example to all the families. The unity and the
relationships among father, mother and children should be developed as in the Holy
Family.
Family is the smallest unit in the society. The unity among father, mother and
children gives rise to love. By sharpening the relationships built on family, the
person enters into society where he serves others. The family which is concerned
with each other provides good citizens to the society.
Picture 17.1 - In a happy family, children are happy and victorious
St. Paul in his letter to the Ephesians advises parents and children.
Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
Honour your father and your mother. This is the first
commandment with a promise: “so that it may be well
with you and you may live long on the earth.” And,
fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring
them up in the discipline and the instruction of the Lord.
(Ephesians 6:1-4)
Parents should treat their children as children of God and respect them as human
beings. The parents should show them how to live according to the commandments
of God and how to live fulfilling God’s will. In the same way there are duties and
responsibilities of children towards their parents.
Duties and responsibilities of parents
To love their children, to give them security and protection, to teach them moral
values, and to provide them with all the necessities are duties of parents.
It is the
parents'
duty to give
their chil-
dren a good
Education
Moral Education
Spiritual nourishment
Value education
Good example
Correction
Evangelization
Teaching to pray
A school where the faith can be developed
School where good education is given
Education to live in a society
Children’s duties and responsibilities
The respect of children, whether minors or adults for them father
and mother is nourished by the natural affection born of the bond
uniting them. It is required by the fourth commandment of God.
Respect for parents derives from gratitude towards those who, by the
gift of life, their love and their work have brought their children into
the world and enabled them to grow in stature, wisdom and grace.
With all your heart honour your father and do not forget the birth
pangs of your mother. Filial respect is shown by obedience. My
son, keep your father’s commandment and forsake not your mother’s
teaching. The fourth commandment reminds grown children of their
responsibilities towards their parents. They must give them material
and moral support in old age, in times of illness and loneliness. It
also concerns relationship between brothers and sisters and grand
parents.
For Christians a special gratitude is due to those from whom they
have received the gift of faith. These may include pastors, catechists,
teachers, friends and others. They have helped us to lead a life
according to our faith.
(CCC 2214 -2220)
Picture 17. 2 - Love and respect for others
Children, obey your parents
in everything, for this is your
acceptable duty in the Lord.
Hear, my child, your father’s in-
struction, and do not reject your
mother’s teaching;
(Colossians 3:20)
(Proverbs 1:8)
For the Lord honours a father
above his children ... Those
who respect their father will
have long life and those who
honer mother obey the Lord
(Sirach 3:2-6)
With all your heart honour your
father, and do not forget the birth
pangs of your mother. Remember
that it was of your parents you were
born, how can you repay what they
have given to you.
(Sirach 7:27-28)
Sins against the fourth commandment
 Not looking after the parents and elders in their old age and not giving them
due respect.
 Harming, scolding and beating parents.
 Deserting the parents.
 Disobedience to parents, elders and teachers and hurt their feeling.
 Misusing of the freedom, given by parents and to deceive them.
 Shatter the expectations of parents and elders.
 Squandering the wealth and properties of parents.
 Breaking laws of the country, society, institutions and school.
 Damaging the common property.
 Skipping or evading one's responsibilities.
A society of love is born when families live in love. When the leaders of the society
are dedicated and committed to their duties they also contribute to build a society
of love. The leader of such a society makes following teaching of Jesus, a reality.
Whoever wishes to be great among you must be your
servant.”
(Mathew 20:26)
Fourth commandment entails duties and responsibilities of the leaders and citizens
The duties and responsibilities of those in authority
 To fulfil all the duties and responsibilities honestly and faithfully
 To carry out their service to the country faithfully.
 To treat all the citizens with justice and love.
 Not to do service to obtain praise and honour from people.
 Committed to their duties.
 To do a good and real service to the citizens of the country together with the
leaders of the Church.
 To safeguard the human rights of people.
 To honour the freedom of the people.
The duties of citizens
To respect and obey those who are in authority.
To pay taxes.
To exercise their vote.
To do the duties, assigned without considering the salary.
To appreciate those in authority.
Pray for those in authority.
- Not to use the properties of the contry for one's personal gain.
According to the teaching of the Holy Scripture by living according to the fourth
Commandment, we can generate love not only in the family but also in the society.
Out of love, we will be enthusiastic to serve others. By doing so we will be able
to live happily and in peacefully. This will be a good example for other families.
This example will help others to become servants of others.

18 Let Us Protect Precious
Human Life
After the festive High Mass of St. Anne’s shrine at Talawila, an announcement was
made over the microphones: “Those who are able to swim, please come forward
quickly to save a person, drowning in the sea. Others please pray for his safety.”
Immediately several people from the crowd ran towards the sea. The others started to
pray. There was a great silence about the place. After some time, it was announced:
“The life of the drowning person was saved. Let us praise the Lord.” (This is a true
story.)
 Why did so many people come forward to rescue the life of the drowning
person risking even their own life?
 Why did even the people who could not swim pray to protect his life?
(1) Man is created in the image and likeness of God
Then God said “Let us make humankind in our image according to
our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea,
and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the wild
animals of the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon
the earth. So God created humankind in his image, in the image of
God he created them; male and female he created them. God blessed
them and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the
earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and
over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves upon
the earth.
(Genesis 1:26-28)
(2) God gave them the breath of life
Then the Lord God formed man of dust from the
ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of
life; and the man became a living being.
(Genesis 2:7)
Fifth Commandment
You shall not murder
(Exodus 20:13)
Lord Jesus gave a new interpretation to the fifth Commandment
You heard that it was said to the men of old “You
shall not murder and whoever murders shall be
liable to judgement. But I say to you that every one
who is angry with his brother or sister shall be liable
to judgement, whoever insults his brother or sister
shall be liable to the council; and whoever says,
“You fool” shall be liable to the hell fire.
(Matthew 5:21-22)
Not only that, Jesus put that into practice in his life.
Then Jesus said to him “Put your sword back
into its place; for all who take the sword will
perish by the sword.”
(Matthew 26:52)
Let us protect life
Let us give up drugs, alcohol and tobacco.
Let us prevent others from them.
Picture 18.1 - Saving another from danger
Let us respect life
In the account of Abel’s murder by his brother Cain,
Scripture reveals the presence of anger and envy in man,
consequences of original sin, from the beginning of human
history. Man has become the enemy of his fellow man.
God declares the wickedness of his fratricide; “What have
you done? The voice your brother’s blood is crying to me
from the ground. And now you are cursed from the ground,
which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s
blood from your hand (Genesis 4:10-11). The Covenant
between God and mankind is interwoven with reminders
of God’s gift of human life and man’s murderous violence.
“Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood
be shed; for God made man in his own image” (Genesis
9:5-6).
(CCC 2259 – 2260)
Life and physical health are precious gifts entrusted
to us by God. Concern for health requires, food
clothing, housing, health care, basic education,
employment and social assistance. When trying
to get all these requirements man can be led to
the perversion of human relationships. The virtue
of temperance disposes us to avoid every kind
of excess; the abuse of food, alcohol, tobacco, or
medicine. Those incur grave guilt who endanger
their own and others’ lives. The use of drugs inflict
very grave damage on human life. Their use, except
for curing of disease, is a grave offence.
(CCC 2288 – 2291)
Sins against the 5th Commandment
 Murder, corportion in murder, advising in murder, planning to murder.
 Suicide - and attempting to suicide
 Use of tobacco
 Destruction of Environment
 Environmetnt poluton (noices, water, air, etc)
 Earn money by ways, detrimental to the life lives of others
 Tarnishing the reputation of others.
 Abortion
 Makes others uneasy as a means of revenge
 Make others jobless by making false accusations
 Makes others part of lawsuits which are not applicable to them
 Drunkenness
 Use of drugs
 Judging others without a cause
 Anger is a desire for revenge.
 Spreading diseases
 Deliberate hatred
 Not standing for the innocent
 Not taking care of physical health
 Not working for the national harmony
 Reckless driving
 Not standing for peace
 Risking one's own life without a reason.
Abortion
Abortion is the taking the life of a child, conceived. It is a sin because life belongs
to God from the moment of conception. The holy Bible teaches:
Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before
you were born I consecrated you. I appointed you a prophet
to the nations.
(Jeremiah 1:5)
My frame was not hidden from
you, when I was being made in
secret intricately woven in the
depths of the earth (womb).
(Psalms 139:15)
Picture 18.2 - Embryo
Human life must be protected and respected absolutely from the
moment of conception . From the first moment of his existence, a
human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person,
among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life.
Abortion, willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary
to the moral law. God, the Lord of life has entrusted to men the
noble mission of safeguarding the life. Abortion infanticide are
abominable crimes.
(CCC 2270-2271)
A priest has to get a special permission from a bishop to absolve a sinner who has
committed a sin of abortion. When one goes to the Sacrament of Reconciliation
to get pardon for an abortion, he has to go to that priest once again since that priest
has to get that permission from a bishop. In some shrines bishop has given prior
permission to priests to absolve those who have committed the sin of abortion.
Suicide
Suicide is a sin against oneself, God and neighbour. Because one terminates the
relationships adamantly.
Everyone is responsible for his life before God who has given it
to him. It is God who remains sovereign master of life. We are
obliged to accept life gratefully and preserve it for his honour and
the salvation of our souls. We are stewards, not owners, of the life
God has entrusted to us. It is not ours to dispose of. Suicide is
contrary to love for the living God.
(CCC 2280-2281)
Let us all commit ourselves to safeguard
our own life and the lives of others.

19 Pure Heart and Chaste Life
When Patriarch Jacob’s son, Joseph was serving in Potiphar’s house, his wife began
to look fondly at him and invited to have an illegal affair with him beccause Joseph
was a very handsome and good looking person. He did not give into her desires
and refused to all what she suggested. One day in the abscence of anyone, Joseph
went into the house to do his work.Then she hold of him by his cloak, but he left
his cloak in her hand and ran outside. As soon as Potiphar came home she told
him that the Hebrew servant whom he had brought, came into her and insulted her.
Joseph’s master took him and put him in prison.
“God can bring good out of evil.” God brought victory to Joseph amidst this evil.
Because of Joseph’s pure heart and upright living, he was able to safeguard his
purity.
If Joseph agreed to the suggestion of Potiphar’s wife, he will sin against 6th
and 9th Commandments.
(1) Sixth Commandment
(2) Ninth Commandment
shall not
adultery.
(Exodus 20:14)
commit
You shall not covet your
neighbour’s wife.
(Exodus 20:17)
St. Paul’ teaches about these two Commandments:
Shun immorality. Every other sin which a man commits
is outside the body; but the immoral man sins against
his own body. Do you not know that your body is a
temple of the Holy Spirit within you, which you have
from God? You are not your own; you were bought
with a price; So glorify God in your body.
(1 Corinthians 6:18-19)
St. Maria Goretti
Picture 19.1- St. Maria Goretti
Chastity
After father’s death, St. Maria Goretti took the
responsibilities of her home with her mother and
she was leading a devout life pleasing to God with
her brothers and sisters. One day when she was
alone in the house, a young man called Alessandro
came to her and was trying to induce her to sin
with him. As she was adamant and did not yield
to his sinful desire, he stabbed her several times.
When she was at the point of her death, she
told her mother, “Mother on the day of my First
Communion I made a promise to Jesus: even if I
have to die I will not commit a mortal sin and I
have kept that promise” and she died. She was 12
years old when she died.
Chastity is refraining and not tempting others from all sins against the 6th and the
9th Commandments. We can make others sin or arouse in them sinful thoughts
by our behaviour or by our dress. Therefore we must always be alert about our
behaviour and our clothing, what we dress and how we dress.
The chaste person maintains the integrity of the powers of life and
love placed in him. This integrity ensures unity of the person, it is
opposed to any behaviour that would impair it. It tolerates neither a
double life nor duplicity in speech. Chastity includes apprenticeship in
self - mastery which is a training in human freedom. The alternative is
clear: either man governs his passions and find peace, or he lets himself
be dominated by them and become unhappy. Man's dignity therefore
requires him to act out of conscious and free choice, as moved and
drawn in personal way from within, and not by blind impulses in
himself or by mere external constraints. Man gains such dignity when
ridding himself of all slavery to the passions. Whoever wants to remain
faithful to his baptismal promises and resist temptations will want to
adopt the means for doing so: self-knowledge, obedience to God’s
command and fidelity to prayer. The virtue of chastity comes under the
cardinal virtue of temperance.
CCC 2338-2341
Married life is a blessing from God. The bodily union between a married man and
a woman is right. Through that they participate in the creative act of God. Marital
acts outside marriage is an act desecrating man’s dignity.
Urge the younger men to controll themselves.
Show yourself in all respects a model of good
deeds and in your teaching show integrity,
gravity.
(Titus 2:6-7)
- Catholic should wear decently.
Their behaviour should be decent
Their talk should be respectful
They should not be led by feelings.
They should have self control to safguard the chaste character.
You have heard that it was said, “You shall not
commit adultery.” But I say to you that every
one who looks at a woman with lust has already
committed adultery with her in his heart.”
(Matthew 5:27-28)
Older women should be reverent in their behaviour,
not slanderers, not addicted to drink; teaching what is
good, so that they may train younger women to love
their husbands and children, to be self-controlled,
chaste, good managers of the household, under the
control of their husbands, so that the word of God
may not be discredited.
(Titus 2:3-5)
To live according to the 6th and 9th Commandments
The married couple have to be faithful to each other.
- Challenges to family life can be overcome by prayer.
All those who are baptized are called to lead a chaste life. At the sermon on the
mount, Jesus himself preached about it taking himself as an example. All Catholics
have made a promise to Jesus at their Baptism to lead a chaste and exemplary lives.

the heavenly kingdom.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall
see God

20 Material Possessions are in view
of Treasures in Heaven
Chrishan :
Father, How can we use our personal belongings to attain treasures in
heaven?
Priest :
Son, in the society some people are rich and some are poor. God
has made some people rich so that they may use their wealth to earn
treasures in heaven.
Chrishan :
It is not clear to me.
Priest :
Son, you listen to these Scripture passages very attentively. Then you
will understand.
Sell your possessions, and give alms; provide
yourselves with purses that do not grow old,
with a treasure in the heavens, that does not
fail, where no thief approaches and no moth
destroys.
(Luke 12:33)
If any one has the world’s goods and sees
his brother in need, yet closes his heart
against him how does God’s love abide in
(1 John 3:17)
Not only these Scripture passages but also the teachings regarding 7th and the 10th
Commandments tell us how to use the personal wealth to enter into the eternal
kingdom.
7th Commandment
You shall not steal.
(Exodus 20:15)
10th Commandment
You shall not covet your neighbour’s
goods.
(Exodus 20:17)
You shall not covet your neighbour's house;... or
his manservant or his maidservant or his ox or
his ass, or anything that is your neighbour's.
(Exodus 20:17)
Teachings of the Catholic Church with regard to personal wealth.
The 7th and 10th commandments forbids unjustly taking or keeping or coverting the
goods of one’s neighbour.
It is the teaching of the Catholic Church that every one has
a right to own property sufficient to maintain himself and his
family. Since God has created for the benefit of all, wealth
should be shared justly and fairly when one enjoys the benefit
of his own possessions he should remember that these are not
solely for his own benefit but also for the benefit of others. Men
are bound to help the poor. In doing so it should not always be
out of one’s affluence, but also out of one’s essential belongings,
considering the need of others.
(Catholic Family Catechism 371)
Let us pay attention to the teaching on protecting the possessions of others.
... nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards,
nor revilers, nor robbers will inherit the king-
dom of God.
(1 Corinthians 6:10)
To observe the 7th and 10th Commandments we should
not steal other's goods, repay out just loans, to be just
in our sales and purchases, to pay just wages to our
employees, to fulfil our duties honestly, to honour our
agreements and contracts to return what we borrow
from others and return whatever belongs to others to
the respective owners.
(Catholic Family Catechism 368)
Picture 20.1 - Asking pardon for sins
Jesus blesses Zacchaeus for his pledge; “If I have defrauded
anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold” (Luke 19:8). Those
who, directly or indirectly, have taken possession of the goods
of another, are obliged to make restitution of them, or to return
the equivalent in kind or in money.
(CCC 2412)
By the 7th and the 10th Commandments, God askes us to love the poor
The church’s love for the poor... is a part of her constant tradition”.
This love is inspired by the Gospel of the Beatitudes, of the
poverty of Jesus and of his concern for the poor. Love for the
poor is even one of the motives for the duty of working so as to
“be able to give those in need”. St. John Chrysostom vigorously
recall this: Not to enable the poor to share in our goods is to steal
from them and deprive them of life, the goods we possess are not
ours, but theirs”. The demands of justice must be satisfied first of
(CCC 2444 - 2446)
20.2 Picture - Helping the poor
Man is not for wealth. God has given wealth for some people for the service of
men. By using the personal wealth in the right way, we obtain God’s blessings
more and more. Therefore we should share not only our personal wealth but also
our intelligence and knowledge.
Let the thief no longer steal but rather let him
labour, doing honest work with his hands, so
that he may be able to give to those in need.
(Ephesians 4:28)

21 Let Us Live Truthfully
21.1 Picture - Peter questioning Ananias
about the sold property.
21. 2 Picture - Death of Ananias
A man named Ananias with the consent of his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of
property. With his wife’s knowledge, he kept back some of the proceeds, and
brought only a part and laid it at the apostles' feet. Peter asked “why has Satan
filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back part of the proceeds
of the land? While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after
it was sold, was it not at your disposal? How is it that you have contrived this
deed in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God”. When Ananias
heard these words, he fell down and died. And great fear seized all who heard
of it; the young men came and wrapped him up and carried him out and buried
After an interval of about three hours, his wife
came in, not knowing what had happened. Peter
said to her, “Tell me whether you and your husband
sold the land for such and such a price.” And she
said, “Yes, that was the price.” Then Peter said
to her, "How is it that you have agreed together
to put the Spirit of the Lord to the test?" Hark the
feet of those who have buried your husband are at
the door, and they will carry you out. Immediately
she fell down at his feet and died. When the young
men came in, they found her dead, so they carried
her out and buried her beside her husband. And
great fear seized the whole Church and all heard of
these things (Acts 5:1-11).
21.3 Picture – Death of Sapphira
Think about this
Ananias and Sapphira thought they can
deceive everybody. With the power of
Holy spirit, St. Peter knew the truth.
St. Peter revealed the truth. Those who
lie to God have terrible repercussions.
This is a very sad story. Those were
two members of the first Christian
Community. Probably they wanted to
be popular in the community and get
their praise. They wanted others to
say that they were good, devout and
generous Christians. Lying is a serious
fault. Ananias and Sapphira committed
the sin of deceiving others. God is
truth. So his children also should be
honest and truthful.
You shall not bear false witness against
your neighbour.
(Exodus 20: 16)
Living in the Truth
God is the source of all truth. His Law is truth. His
faithfulness endures to all generations. Since God is “true”
the members of his people are called to live in the truth
(CCC 2465)
The eighth Commandment tells since God is “true”, the members of his people are
called to live in the truth and bear witness to the truth. To live in truth, one must
allow the conscience to speak.
In Jesus Christ, the whole of God’s truth has been made manifest.
“Full of grace and truth” he came as the “light of the world”.
He is the truth. “Whoever believes in me may not remain in
darkness. The disciple of Jesus continues in his word so as to
know “the truth (that) will make you free” and that sanctifies. To
follow Jesus is ”to live in the Spirit of truth,” whom the Father
sends in his name and who leads “into all the truth” Truthfulness
is the virtue which consists in showing oneself, true in deeds
and truthful in words, and in guarding against duplicity and
hypocrisy.
CCC 2466-2470
Bear witness to Truth
Jesus Christ, through his life bore witness to truth.
Pilate said to him, “So you are a king?" Jesus answered,
“You say that I am a king. For this I was born, and for this I
have come in to the world, to bear witness to the truth. Every
one who is of the truth hears my voice.”
John 18:37
The Christian is not “to be ashamed” then of testifying to our Lord.
In situations that require witness to the faith, the Christian must
profess it without any fear or doubt. The duty of the Christians is
to take part in the life of the Church impels them to act as witnesses
of the Gospel and of the obligations that flow from it. This witness
is a transmission of the faith in words and deeds. Martyrdom is the
supreme witness given to the truth of the faith: It means bearing
witness even unto death. The martyrs bear witness to the truth of the
faith and of Christian doctrine.
CCC 2471-2474
The sins against the 8th Commandment
 Speaking ill of others
 Lying, spreading rumours
 Cheating
 Revealing official secrets
 Not bearing witness to truth
 Putting one's fault on others
 Work only for one's benifits
 Betraying others for one's reputation

 Giving false promises
 Hiding sins at confession
 Deceiving parents, teachers, employers, etc.
 Teaching false facts
 Charactor Assassination.
 Boasting
 Publishing false information.
 Misleading others by telling lies.
Professional Secrets
Politicians, government servants, doctors and lawyers are bound to keep in
secret confidential information, given under the seal of secrecy. Revealing such
information may have bad repercussion on those who
1. gave the information
2. received the information
3. Third party,
Such information can be revealed if and only if such an act
does not harm any body. But it has to be done cautiously and
prudently. Besides, there has to be a just reason to do so.
(CCC 2491)

22 Liturgical Year
The word, Liturgy is derived from
the Greek word “Leitourgia.” That
word is made up of two words, “Laos”
and “Ergon.” “Laos” means people.
“Ergon” means a voluntary service,
public service. Accordingly Leitourgy
means a work done for the benifit
of people without a charge. Those
days feasts and public services were
considered as Leitourgia.
Pope Pius the XII in his Encyclical,
Mediator Dei explains liturgy:
“The Church prolongs priestly mission of Jesus Christ mainly by
means of the sacred Liturgy. Sacred Liturgy is the public worship
which our redeemer as Head of the Church renders to the Father as
well as worship which the community of the faithful renders to its
founder, and through Him to the Heavenly Father.
(Encyclical Mediator Dei 3 and 20)
• The constitution on the Sacred Liturgy no 7 of Second Vatican Council
explains liturgy:
The liturgy is the whole public worship performed by the mystical
body of Jesus Christ, that is, by the Head and His members.
Liturgy includes
1. Holy Sacrifice of the Mass.
2. The Sacraments.
3. The Divine Office.
The liturgical year is very helpful to the people of God, to commemorate and live
Christ’s Paschal Mystery and his redeeming ministry. As in an ordinary year there
are 52 weeks in a liturgical year.
Sundays of the liturgical year is divided into 3 cycles. They are First Year, Second
Year and Third Year. Gospels are used differently in these 3 years.
First Year
Second Year
Third Year
Gospel of Matthew
Gospel of Mark
Gospel of Luke
Gospel of John is used during the seasons of Lent and Easter. Liturgically the most
important day of the week is Sunday. We commemorate the Paschal Mystery on
that day.

Picture 24.1
Jesus is having the Last Supper with the disciples
Jesus Christ did certain things at the Last Supper
1. Institution of the Holy Eucharist
2. Institution of the Sacrament of Holy Orders
3. Washing of the feet of the apostles
4. Pray to God using the High Priestly Prayer
Lord Jesus prayed to God using the High Priestly Prayer at the Last supper when
His desciples were around Him. It is reported in the Gospel of John, chapter 17.
This prayer summerizes the mission of Jesus. Unity is the theme that runs through
out the whole prayer.
The High Priestly Prayer has three sections.
1. Praying for Himself
Since Jesus had come from the Father and fulfilled the mission entrusted to Him,
He prays to the Father that he may be glorified.
Father the hour has come; glorify thy Son that the Son may glorify
thee, since thou hast given him power over all flesh, to give eternal
life to all whom thou hast given him. And this is eternal life, that
they know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast
sent. I glorified thee on earth, having accomplished the work which
thou gavest me to do; and now, Father, glorify thou me in thy own
presence with the glory which I had with thee before the world was
made.
(John 17:1-5)
2. Praying for His Disciples
The disciples, chosen by Jesus belonged to God. God had chosen them and given
to Jesus. Therefore, he prayed that God may protect them.
“ I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou gavest me out
of the world; thine they were, and thou gavest them to me, and they
have kept thy word. Now they know that everything that thou hast
given me is from thee; for I have given them the words which thou
gavest me, and they have received them and know in truth that I
came from thee; and they have believed that thou didst send me. I
am praying for them; I am not praying for the world but for those
whom thou hast given me, for they are thine; all mine are thine, and
thine are mine, and I am glorified in them. And now I am no more in
the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to thee. Holy
Father, keep them in thy name which thou hast given me, that they
may be one, even as we are one. While I was with them, I kept them
in thy name, which thou hast given me; I have guarded them, and
none of them is lost but the son of perdition, that the scripture might
be fulfilled. But now I am coming to thee; and these things I speak in
the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves. I have
given them thy word; and the world has hated them because they are
not of the world, even as I am not of the world. I do not pray that
thou shouldst take them out of the world, bur that thou shouldst
keep them from the evil one. They are not of the world, even as I
am not of the world. Sanctify them in the truth; they word is truth.
As thou didst send me into the world, so I have sent them into the
world. And for their sake I consecrate myself, that they also may
be consecrated in truth.”
(John 17: 6-19)
3. Praying for the unity of the Future Church
Through those disiples many may recognize Jesus in the future. Yet due to the
disputes among them, they will be get devided into various groups. Having foreseen
the future, he prayed to the Father for the unity of the Church.
I do not pray for these only, but also for those who believe in me
through their word, that they may all be one; even as thou, Father,
art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be in us, so that the world
may believe that thou hast sent me. The glory which thou hast given
me I have given to them, that they may be one even as we are one, I
in them and thou in me, that they may become perfectly one, so that
the world may know that thou hast sent me and hast loved them even
as thou hast loved me. Father, I desire that they also, whom thou hast
given me, may be with me where I am, to behold my glory which
thou hast given me in thy love for me before the foundation of the
world. O righteous Father, the world has not known thee, but I have
known thee; and these know that thou hast sent me. I made known to
them thy name, and I will make it known, that the love with which
thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.
(John 17: 20-26)
Ecumenism
As Jesus Christ foretold, as time passed by the Church got divided into different
groups (sects). These Churches can be divided into two groups.
1. Mainline Churches.
2. Fundamentalists.
There are the seven mainline Churches, accepted by the Catholic hurch.
1. Church of Ceylon (Church of England / Anglican Church)
2. Methodist Church
3. Baptist Church
4. Dutch Reformed Church (Christian Reformed Church)
5. Presbyterian Church
6. South Indian Church
7. Greek Orthodox Church
Jesus Christ instituted the Church under the leadership of St. Peter to carryout the
plan of salvation till the end of time, as a sign of salvation here on earth. Jesus
instituted only one Church and not many Churches. It was not his will that there
should be division in the Church. Yet the church was divided due to various
reasons in the history. The main reasons for these divisions are human weakness
and sinfulness. In the High Priestly Prayer of Jesus, He prayed to the Father for
the unity of the church (John 17:20-21). Though the church is devided into various
fractions, we who witness to christ has a bounden duty to establish “one, Holy,
Catholic (Universal) and apostolic Church.”
Second vatican counicl has promulgated two documents with regard to eucmenism:
1. Decree on the Catholic Churches of the Eastern Rite
2. Decree on ecumenism
As a result of ecumenism a few steps have been taken recently.
The week of prayer for Christian Unity (Unity Week) is a Christian ecumenical
observance kept annually between 18-25 January
To work cordially with regard to religious and social matters.
To participate together in spiritual and theological discussions.
In the year 1983 the new edition of the Sinhala Bible was published with
the approval of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference and the Christian Churches.

25 Prayer at Gethsemane
Picture 25.1 - The prayer of Jesus in the Garden of
Gethsemane
Agnes :
What a beautiful picture! Why did you bring it?
Theresa :
Today’s lesson is on the prayer in the garden of Gethsemane. That is
why I brought this picture. This picture shows how Jesus prayed in
the Garden of Gethsemane
Agnes :
Did Jesus go alone to pray in the Garden of Gethsemane
Theresa :
Agnes :
Theresa :
No. It was with his disciples that he went to pray. Jesus instructed
Peter, Jacob and John, three a apostles of Jesus, to be near to Him,
and to pray but they slept without praying.
Is that true? I also often go to sleep without praying. Do you do the
same?
I recite the rosary daily before going to sleep. Though Jesus asked
the three disciples to pray three times on that day in the Garden of
Gethsemane, what they did was to sleep without praying.
Agnes :
Like you from today I will also try to say the daily rosary.
Theresa :
Can you remember that our religion teacher said praying always
without forgetting is a characteristic of a child of God.
Agnes :
Look, the teacher is coming… Let us learn more about the prayer at
the Garden of Gethsemane.
The important message of the prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane (Mark 14:32-42)
is that, we must prepare ourselves in prayer for all our important moments of life.
Garden at Gethsemane is located on the western slope of mount of Olives facing
Jerusalem. After the High Priestly Prayer (John 18:1). Jesus with his disciples
went to the place called Gethsemane and said to the disciples:
... “Sit here while I pray”...
(Mark 14:32)
... My soul is very sorrowful, even to
death,remain here, and awake”
(Mark 14:34)
Then He went a little further and he threw himself on the ground and prayed,
“Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee; this cup remove
from me; yet not what I will, but what thou will”
(Mark 14:36)
Three things are implied from the Prayer of Gethsemane
3. His passion and suffering.
Jesus, ity human.
The relationship between God and Jesus Christ.
Through the prayer of Gethsemane Jesus obtained the strength to let the plan of
God to take place. But as the apostles did not pray, they fell into temptation. When
Judas came to arrest Jesus with the chief priests, scribes and the elders:
The apostles fled in fear.
The ear of the chief priest's servant Malkus was cut by Peter,
Peter denied three times that he did not know Jesus.
The experience at Gethsemane takes an important place in the account of the
sufferings of Jesus.
Just like children speak to their parents, we can speak to God as His children. Jesus
the Son of God prayed to the Father in all occasions. Therefore prayer should be a
part of our daily lives. The Christian life depends very much on prayer. Preparing
a suitable place for prayer in your house or room is helpful to pray.
I will make prayer a part of my daily
routine.
I will pray the rosary daily as a family.
I will participate in Holy Hours and prayer
services to nourish my spiritual life.
I will make it a habit to pray daily at a
fixed time.
