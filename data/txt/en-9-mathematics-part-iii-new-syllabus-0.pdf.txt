Inequalities
By studying this lesson you will be able to;
² solve inequalities of the form x + a
² solve inequalities of the form ax
² find the integral solutions of an inequality,
² represent the solutions of an inequality on a number line.
In Sri Lanka, a person who is 55 years or older is considered to be a senior citizen.
Accordingly, if we denote the age of a senior citizen by t, then we can indicate this
by the inequality t
55. This means that the value of t is always greater or equal
to 55.
Let us recall what was learnt in grade 8 regarding inequalities.
x > 3 is an inequality. This means that the values that x can take are the values that
are greater than 3. However, if we write x
3 , this means that the values that x can
take are 3 or a value greater than 3.
Similarly, x < 3 means that the values that x can take are the values that are less
3 means that the values that x can take are 3 or a value less than 3.
than 3, and x
For example, the solution set of x > 3 is the set of all numbers which are greater
than 3. The set of integral solutions of this inequality is {4, 5, 6, 7, …}.
The three dots mean that all the integers which belong to the pattern indicated by
the first few values belong to the solution set. Therefore, the above inequality has
infinitely many integral solutions.
Although in mathematics it is important to represent all the solutions as a set, when
indicating the integral solutions of an inequality, it is sufficient to just write the
values. For example, the integral solutions of the inequality x > 3 can be written as
4, 5, 6, … .
For free distribution.
The solution set of an inequality which has an algebraic term, is the set of all values
that the algebraic term can take. Let us recall what has been learnt earlier regarding
the solution set of an inequality, and how this is represented on a number line, by
considering the following examples.
Example 1
Consider the inequality x > 3.
i. Write the set of integral solutions of the above inequality.
ii. Represent the integral solutions of the above inequality on a number line.
i. {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, ...}
ii. – 1
Example 2
Consider the inequality x
i. Write the set of integral solutions of the above inequality.
ii. Represent the integral solutions of the above inequality on a number line.
i. {..., – 3, – 2, – 1, 0, 1}
– 2 –1
Example 3
Represent the solution set of the inequality x > – 3 1
on a number line.
– 3 – 2
Example 4
Represent the solution set of the inequality x
– 2 on a number line.
– 3 – 2
Example 5
Represent the solution set of the inequality – 3 < x
on a number line.
– 3 – 2
For free distribution.
Review Exercise

on a number line.

i. x > 2
iii. x < 4

– 2.5
v. x > 1
2. For each of the following, write an inequality that has the values represented
on the number line as its solution set.

line.

iii. – 3 < x
ii. – 2
x < 3
iv. x < – 1 or x
– 3 or x > 0
21.1 Inequalities of the form x + a
The following notice has been placed near a certain bridge.
—This bridge can only bear loads of less than 10 tons˜
Suppose a lorry of mass 4 tons carrying a certain load wishes to cross this bridge.
If we take the mass of the load carried by the lorry to be x tons, then the lorry can
safely cross the bridge only if x + 4 < 10. In other words, if the mass of the load
carried by the lorry is x tons, then the lorry can safely cross the bridge, only if the
inequality x + 4 < 10 is satisfied.
We can find the mass of the load that the lorry can safely carry across the bridge by
solving the inequality x + 4 < 10.
Solving an inequality means, obtaining an inequality equivalent to the given
inequality such that only x (or the given variable) is on one side of the inequality.
When solving an inequality, we can adopt the procedure followed in solving
equations to a large extent.
For example, we can subtract 4 from both sides of the above inequality x + 4 < 10.
Accordingly,
x + 4 – 4 < 10 – 4.
When we simplify this we obtain
x < 6.
For free distribution.
Therefore, for the lorry to safely cross the bridge, the load that it carries should be
less than 6 tons.
Example 1
Solve the inequality x + 2 < 7 and represent the integral solutions on a number
line.
x + 2 < 7
x + 2 – 2 < 7 – 2 (subtracting 2 from both sides)
x < 5
The integral solutions of this inequality are the integers that are less than 5. That is,
the values 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, –1, –2, … .
These integral solutions can also be expressed as a set as {4, 3, 2, 1, 0, – 1, – 2, …}
The solution set can be represented on a number line as follows.
Integral solutions of x
Example 2
Solve the inequality x – 3
1 and represent the solution set on a number line.
x – 3 1
x – 3 + 3
1 + 3 (adding 3 to both sides)
Now let us represent the solution set on a number line.
All the solutions (numbers that are greater or equal to 4) are represented here. It is
important to remember that not only the integral solutions, but solutions such as 4.5
and 5.02 are also included.
Example 3
The maximum mass that a bag can carry is 6 kg. Nimal puts x packets of rice of
mass 1 kilogramme each and 2 packets of sugar of mass 1 kilogramme each into
this bag. This information can be represented by the inequality x + 2 6.
For free distribution.
i. Solve this inequality.
ii. What is the maximum number of packets of rice that Nimal can carry in this bag?
i. x + 2
x + 2 – 2
6 – 2
ii. Therefore, the maximum number of packets of rice that can be carried in
this bag is 4.
Exercise 21.1
1. Solve each of the following inequalities and write the set of integral solutions.
i. x + 3 > 5
v. 7 + x > 5
ii. x – 4 < 1
iii. x – 7
– 6 iv. 2 + x
2. Solve each of the following inequalities and represent the solution set on a
number line.
i. x + 1 > 3
v. x + 5 > – 1
ii. x – 3
iii. 6 + x
2 iv. x – 7 < – 7
3. Sakindu has 60 rupees. He buys a book for x rupees and a pen for 10 rupees.
The total value of the items he bought can be expressed in terms of an inequality
60. Solve this inequality and determine the maximum price that the
as x + 10
book could be.
4.The maximum number of people that can travel in a certain van is 15. If 3
people get into the van from one location and x number of people from another
location, this information can be represented by the inequality x + 3
i. Solve the above inequality.
ii. What is the maximum number of people that can get into the van from the
second location?
5. The sum of the ages of Githmi and Nethmi does not exceed 30. Githmi is 14
years old. If Nethmi’s age is taken as x years, this information can be represented
by the inequality x + 14 30. Solve this inequality and find the maximum age
that Nethmi could be.
For free distribution.
21.2 Inequalities of the form ax
The price of two books of the same type is more than 40 rupees. If we take the
price of one of these books as x rupees, we can represent this information by the
inequality 2x > 40 involving x. By solving this inequality, we can find the price that
each book could be.
When solving this type of inequalities there are some important facts that we should
keep in mind.
Consider the following inequalities.
i. The inequality 3 < 4 is true.
2 3 < 2 4 (multiplying both sides by 2)
The inequality 6 < 8 is true.
ii. The inequality 8 > 6 is true.
The inequality 4 > 3 is true.
(dividing both sides by 2)
When the two sides of an inequality are either multiplied by the same positive
number or divided by the same positive number, the inequality sign does not change.
iii. The inequality 2 < 3 is true.
2 – 2 < 3 – 2 (multiplying both sides by – 2)
The inequality – 4 < – 6 which is obtained is false. However, – 4 > – 6
is true.
iv. The inequality 9 > 6 is true.
– 3 >
– 3 (dividing both sides by – 3)
The inequality – 3 > – 2 which is obtained is false. However, – 2 < – 3
is true.
When an inequality is multiplied or divided by a negative number, the inequality
sign changes. That is, the sign < changes to > and the sign
changes to , etc .
Through the following examples, let us learn how inequalities are solved taking
into consideration the above facts.
For free distribution.
Example 1
Solve the inequality 2 x < 12 and represent the solutions on a number line.
2 x < 12
x < 6
(dividing both sides by 2)
Example 2
Solve the inequality 3x
Example 3
Solve the inequality – 5x
(when dividing by a negative number the sign changes)
Example 4
Solve the inequality
3 < 2 3 (multiplying both sides by 3)
x < 6
For free distribution.
Example 5
Solve the inequality – 2x
– 2x > 30
5 > 6 5 (multiplying both sides by 5)
(the sign changes when dividing by – 2)
x < – 15

line.

viii. – 3x
3. The price of 2 mangoes is less than 50 rupees. If the price of one mango is x
rupees, this information can be represented by the inequality 2x ≤ 50. Solve this
inequality and find the maximum possible price of a mango.
4. The maximum mass that can be carried by an elevator is 560 kilogrammes. Eight
men of mass x kilogrammes each are riding this elevator. This information can
560. Find the maximum mass that each
be represented by the inequality 8x
man could be.
(a) The amount of money Mahesh has is less than four times the amount that
Ashan has. Mahesh as 68 rupees. If the amount that Ashan has is denoted by
x rupees, then this information can be represented by the inequality 4x > 68.
Solve this inequality.
(b) If Ashan has only 5 rupee coins, what is the least amount he could be having?
For free distribution.
Summary
² When the two sides of an inequality are either multiplied by the same positive
number or divided by the same positive number, the inequality sign does not
change.
² When an inequality is multiplied or divided by a negative number, the
inequality sign changes. That is, the sign < changes to > and the sign
changes to , etc.
For free distribution.
By studying this lesson you will be able to;
• identify finite and infinite sets,
• write the subsets of a given set,
• identify equivalent sets, equal sets, disjoint sets and universal sets,
• identify the intersection and union of two sets,
• identify the complement of a set,
• represent sets using Venn diagrams.
Introduction to sets
You have learnt earlier that a set is a collection of items that can be clearly identified.
The items in a set are called its elements. Curly brackets are used to represent sets
in terms of their elements. If a is an element of the set A, we denote this by a A.
Moreover, the number of elements in the set A is denoted by n(A).
Let us recall what was learnt previously about the different ways in which a set can
be expressed.
1. Describing the set using a common characteristic by which the elements can be
clearly identified
2. Writing the elements within curly brackets
3. Using a Venn diagram
As an example, let us consider how to write the set of all even numbers between 0
and 10 using the above 3 methods in the given order. Let us name this set A.
1. A = {even numbers between 0 and 10}
2. A = {2, 4, 6, 8}
The set which has no elements is known as the null set. The null set is denoted by
{ } and also by O. The number of elements in the null set is 0. Therefore, n(O) = 0.
For free distribution.
Example 1
If P = {even prime numbers between 5 and 10}, then find n(P).
Since there are no even prime numbers between 5 and 10, P = O and therefore
n(P) = 0.
Review Exercise
1. Determine whether each of the following collections is a set.
i. Multiples of four between 0 and 30
ii. The districts of Sri Lanka
iii. Students who are good at mathematics
iv. Triangular numbers
v. The 10 largest integers
2. Write each set given below in terms of its elements and write the number of
elements in each set too.
i. A = {multiples of 5 between 0 and 20};
ii. B = {letters of the word “RECONCILLIATION”}
iii. C = {prime numbers between 2 and 13}
iv. D = {numbers between 0 and 20 which are a product of two prime
numbers}
3. D = {whole numbers between 5 and 10}.
i. Write the elements of D.
ii. Find n(D).
4. Express the null set in three different ways using the above mentioned first
method (That is, by the descriptive method using a special characteristic.)
For free distribution.
22.1 Finite sets, infinite sets, equivalent sets and equal sets
Finite sets and infinite sets
Two sets which have been expressed in terms of a common characteristic by which
the elements of the set can be clearly identified, are given below.
A = {multiples of 3 between 0 and 20}
B = {multiples of 5}
Let us write the elements of each set within curly brackets.
A = {3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18}
B = {5, 10, 15, 20, ...}
The number of elements in set A is 6. That is, the number of elements in this set is a
specific number. Sets with a specific number of elements (that is, sets with a finite
number of elements), are known as finite sets.
The number of elements in set B however, cannot be stated definitely. That is, the
number of elements in this set is infinite. Three dots have been placed at the end
of the list of numbers within curly brackets to denote that the set B has an infinite
number of elements. Sets that have an infinite number of elements are known as
infinite sets.
Example 1
For each of the sets given below, write the elements and write whether it is a finite
set or an infinite set.
P = {positive multiples of 6 less than 30}
Q = {polygons}
P = {6, 12, 18, 24} n(P) = 4
Q = {triangle, quadrilateral, pentagon, hexagon, … }
Since the number of elements in the set P is finite, P is a finite set. Since the number
of elements in the set Q is infinite, Q is an infinite set.
Equal sets
Consider the two sets given below.
A = {even numbers between 0 and 10}
B = {digits of the number 48268}
For free distribution.
These two sets can be written as follows in terms of their elements.
A = {2, 4, 6, 8}
B = {2, 4, 6, 8}
Although the two sets A and B have been described differently, when they are
written in terms of their elements, we get the same set. Sets which have the same
elements are known as equal sets. Accordingly, A and B are equal sets. If two sets
A and B are equal then we write A = B.
Equivalent sets
If the number of elements in the two sets A and B are equal, that is, if n(A) = n(B),
then the sets A and B are known as equivalent sets.
If A and B are equivalent sets, we denote this by A~B.
Example 2
X = {odd numbers between 0 and 10}
Y = {vowels in the English alphabet}
By writing the elements of these sets, show that they are equivalent sets.
x = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} n(X) = 5
y = {a, e, i, o, u} n(Y) = 5
Since n(X) = n(Y), X and Y sets are equivalent sets.
Note :- Although all pairs of equal sets are equivalent, all pairs of equivalent sets
need not be equal.
Exercise 22.1
1. From the sets given below, select and write the finite sets and the infinite sets
separately.
i. A = {multiples of 5 from 0 to 50}
ii. B = {integers}
iii. C ={numbers that can be written using only the digits 0 and 1}
iv. D = {digits of the number 25265}
v. E = {positive integers which are not prime}
For free distribution.
2. Write each of the following sets in terms of their elements and then write all
pairs of equal sets and all pairs of equivalent sets.
P = {positive multiples of 3 below 10}
Q = {letters of the word “net”}
R = {odd numbers between 0 and 10}
S = {digits of the number 3693}
T = {vowels in the English alphabet}
v = {letters of the word “ten”}
3. Write 3 examples of finite sets.
4. Write 3 examples of infinite sets.
5. Write three sets which are equivalent to the set {2, 3}.
22.2 The universal set and subsets
Subsets
When two sets A and B are considered, if all the elements in set B are also in set A,
then set B is known as a subset of set A.
As an example, let us consider the two sets given below which are expressed in
terms of their elements.
A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
B = {2, 4, 6}
Since all the elements in set B are in set A, set B is a subset of set A. This is denoted
by B ∩ A or A ∩ B, and is read as " B is a subset of A".
Now let us consider another set C. If C = {1, 2, 7}, then not every element in C
belongs to A. Therefore C is not a subset of A. This is denoted by C ∩ A.
Example 1
P = {multiples of 6 between 0 and 20}
Q = {multiples of 3 between 0 and 20}
Write the elements of each of the above sets and select the subset.
P = {6, 12, 18}
For free distribution.
Q = {3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18}
As all the elements of P are in Q, P is a subset of Q.
Example 2
Write all the subsets of the set X = {1, 2}.
It is evident that {1} and {2} are two subsets. Observe that {1, 2} is also a subset.
In fact, if two sets A and B are equal, then A is a subset of B and B is a subset of A.
Furthermore, the null set is considered to be a subset of every set.
Since the null set and the set itself are subsets of the given set, { } and {1, 2} are
subsets of the above set X.
Accordingly, the above set X has 4 subsets which are { },{1},{2},{1, 2}.
Example 3
Write all the subsets of the set Y = {3, 5, 7}.
{ }, {3}, {5}, {7}, {3, 5}, {3, 7}, {5, 7}, {3, 5, 7}
There are 8 subsets.
Universal sets
In a study conducted on the students of your school, several subsets may come
under consideration.
The following can be given as examples.
{Students in grade 9}
{Female students}
{Students sitting for the G.C.E (O/L) examination this year}
The elements of all the above sets are contained in the set of all students of the
school. This set can be considered as the universal set relevant to the above study.
Let us consider another example.
When we consider the sets of even numbers, odd numbers, triangular numbers and
prime numbers, we see that they are all subsets of the set of integers. Therefore the
set of integers can be considered as the universal set.
A universal set is a set which contains all the elements under consideration.
Universal sets are denoted by ε.
For free distribution.
As another example, suppose that the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are written on the
6 sides of a cubic die. By rolling this die once, the score that can be obtained is one
of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.Therefore, we obtain {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} as the set
of possible outcomes. This is the universal set of all possible outcomes that can be
obtained when a die is rolled once.
This can be expressed as ε = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. A few subsets of this universal set
are given below.
A = {odd numbers}
B = {values greater than 4} B = {5, 6}
C = {even prime numbers} C = {2}
A = {1, 3, 5}
Example 4
Write a universal set for A; A = {2, 4, 6, 8}
ε = {numbers between 1 and 10}
Exercise 22.2
1. Write 8 subsets of the set A = {2, 5, 8, 10, 13}.
2. Determine whether each of the following statements is true or not.
i. {1, 2, 3 } ∩ {numbers divisible by 5}
ii. {4, 9, 16 } ∩ {square numbers}
iii. {cylinder} ∩ {polygons}
iv. {red} ∩ {colours of the rainbow}
v. {solution of 2x − 1 = 7} ∩ {even numbers}
3. Write a universal set for the set A; A = {a, e, i, o, u}
4. For each of the following parts, name a suitable universal set, such that the
given sets are subsets.
i. {5, 10, 15, 20, 25} , {10, 100, 100, ...}
ii. {countries with more than 90% literacy},{countries which are not bordered
by an ocean}
iii. {January, March, May, August}, {months with 31 days}
{months during which the members of your family celebrate their birthdays}
For free distribution.
22.3 Venn diagrams
You have learnt how to represent sets in a Venn diagram in earlier grades. In Venn
diagrams, sets are represented by closed figures.
The universal set is represented in a Venn diagram by a rectangle as shown below.
The subsets of a universal set are represented using round or oval shaped figures
(circles or ellipses)
We represent a subset A within the universal set as follows.
Example 1
ε = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
A = {2, 4, 6,}
Represent the above sets in a Venn diagram.
Two subsets of a universal set are generally represented as below.
Special instances of two subsets of a universal set are shown below.
For free distribution.
When the two sets
A and B have no
elements in common
When A and B have
common elements
When B is a subset
When A and B
are equal
You will learn more about these four instances and the corresponding regions under
the next section on the intersecton of sets, union of sets and disjoint sets.
22.4 Intersection of sets, union of sets and disjoint sets
Intersection of sets
When two or more sets are considered, the set consisting of the elements which are
common to all the sets is known as their intersection. When two sets A and B are
considered, their intersection is denoted by A∩B.
As an example, let us consider the pair of sets given below,
A ={1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}
B ={2, 5, 6, 7}
The set consisting of the elements common to both A and B is {2, 5, 7}.
Therefore, the intersection of the sets A and B is A∩B = {2, 5, 7}.
Example 1
M = {students of KannangaraVidyalaya who play cricket}
N = {students of KannagaraVidyalaya who play football}
Write the set M∩N in descriptive form.
M∩N = {students of KannangaraVidyalaya who play both cricket and football}
For free distribution.
Now let us consider how the intersection of two sets is represented in a Venn
diagram.
Suppose the two sets A and B have common elements.
That is, A and B have a non - empty intersection. There should be a region to
represent the set of elements common to both these sets. The Venn diagram depicting
this is given below.
The shaded region in the figure is common to both the sets A and B. Therefore the
elements that are common to these two sets can be included here.
Let us consider how to represent two sets with a non-empty intersection in a Venn
diagram, through the following example.
Example 2
Write the following two sets by listing their elements and then find their intersection.
Represent all the elements in a Venn diagram.
P ={prime numbers between 0 and 10}
Q ={odd numbers between 0 and 15}
P ={2, 3, 5, 7}
Q ={1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13}
∴ P∩Q = {3, 5, 7}
The intersecton of two sets under different conditions are given below.
A∩B when B∩A
(iii)
A∩B when A = B
A∩B = B when B∩A
A∩B = A = B when A = B
For free distribution.
Let us consider how two sets which do not have common elements represented in
a Venn diagram.
Disjoint sets
If two sets have no elements in common, then they are known as disjoint sets. In
other words, if two sets A and B are such that A∩B = O, then A and B are disjoint
sets.
Disjoint sets can be represented in a Venn diagram as shown below.
As an example, let us consider the two sets shown below.
A ={2, 4, 6, 8}
B ={1, 3, 5, 7}
Since A∩B = O, A and B are disjoint sets.
A∩B = O
Union of sets
When two or more sets are considered, the set which consists of all the elements
in these sets is known as the union of these sets. When two sets A and B are
considered, their union is denoted by A∩B.
As an example, let us consider the pair of sets given below.
A ={1, 3, 5, 7, 8}
B ={2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8}
The union of the sets A and B is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}.
Accordingly, the union of the sets A and B is A∩B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
For free distribution.
Example 1
P = {prime numbers between 0 and 10}
P = {odd numbers between 0 and 10}
Write these sets in terms of their elements and write P∩Q also in terms of its
elements. Furthermore, express the union in terms of a common characteristic of
its elements.
P ={2, 3, 5, 7}
Q ={1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
P∩Q ={1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9}
The union expressed in terms of a common characteristic;
P∩Q ={numbers between 0 and 10 which are either prime or odd}
Example 2
X = {students in KannangaraVidyalaya who play cricket}
Y = {students in KannangaraVidyalaya who play football}
X∩Y={students in Kannangara Vidyalaya who play either cricket or football or
both}
Now, let us see how to represent the union of sets in a Venn diagram.
A∩B when B ∩A
A∩B = A
(iii)
A∩B when A = B
A∩B =
A∩B = A =B when A = B
For free distribution.

v. Express A∩B in terms of its elements.

22.5 Complement of a set
Let us consider a subset A of a universal set. The set of elements in the universal set
which do not belong to the set A is known as the complement of A.
Consider the following example.
For free distribution.
If we take,
ε = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} and A = {2, 4, 6},
then the set consisting of all the elements in the universal set which are not in set A
is {1, 3, 5, 7}.
This set is the complement of the set A. The complement of the set A is denoted by
A'. Accordingly,
we can write, A' = {1, 3, 5, 7}.
Example 1
By considering the given universal set (ε) and its subset B, write the set B' in terms
of its elements.
ε ={5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35}
B ={10, 20, 30 }
B = {5, 15, 25, 35}
Example 2
If ε = {birds}and
P = {birds that make nests}, then write P in descriptive form.
P ={birds that do not make nests}
Now let us see how to represent the complement of a set in a Venn diagram.
If A is a subset of a universal set, then A' is represented in a Venn diagram as
follows.
A is the set of elements which belong to ε but not to A. Therefore the whole region
in the Venn diagram which does not belong to A, belongs to A .

The area of a parallelogram
A quadrilateral with opposite sides parallel to each other is called a parallelogram.
We learnt in grade 8 that the opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal. Accordingly,
in the parallelogram PQRS,
PQ SR and PS QR'
PQ = SR and PS = QR
23.1 The base and height of a parallelogram
Any side of the parallelogram given in the figure can be considered as the base. How
the height of the parallelogram corresponding to each base is defined is explained
below.
Suppose AB is considered as the base of the parallelogram. AB and DC (the side
opposite AB) are parallel to each other. According to the figure, the perpendicular
distance between these two sides is XY. Therefore, XY is the perpendicular height
corresponding to the base AB. When BC is considered as the base, the perpendicular
distance between the parallel sides BC and AD according to the figure is PQ.
Therefore, PQ is the perpendicular height corresponding to the base BC.

Through the following activity, let us understand how to construct a formula for the
area of a parallelogram.
Activity 1
Step 1: In your exercise book, draw a rectangle which is equal in size to that
given in the figure. Let us consider its length to be a units and its width
to be h units.
h units
a units
Step 2: Draw another rectangle with the same measurements on another square
ruled paper and cut it out.
Step 3: Take that rectangle and cut off the shaded portion as shown below.

Step 4: Create a parallelogram by pasting the triangular portion that was cut off
in your exercise book, as shown in the figure. Name it ABPQ.
Step 5: Find the area of the rectangle drawn initially, in terms of a and h.
Understand that the area of the parallelogram and the area of the initial rectangle
are equal to each other.
Area of parallelogram ABPQ = Area of rectangle ABCD
= a × h square units
For free distribution.
Observe that h is the perpendicular height corresponding to the base AB.
According to these facts, a formula for the area of a parallelogram can be given as
below.
Area of a parallelogram = Length of the base × Perpendicular height
corresponding to the base
Let us now consider another method by which the areas of a parallelogram can be
found.
The area of a parallelogram can be found by finding the areas of triangles as well.
Consider the parallelogram ABCD.
Suppose the length of the base AB is a units
and the corresponding height is h units. The
parallelogram ABCD is divided into two
triangles ABD and BCD by the diagonal DB.
The area of triangle ABD = 1
× a × h
The area of triangle BCD = 1
× DC × h
× a × h (Since AB = DC)
Area of parallelogram ABCD = Area of triangle ABD + Area of triangle BCD
× a × h
× a × h + 1
2 = 2ah
∴The area of the parallelogram ABCD is ah square units.
For free distribution.
Example 1

A quadrilateral with one pair of sides parallel is called a trapezium. Several figures

Let us develop a formula for the area of a trapezium.
Let us take the lengths of the parallel sides AB and
DC of the trapezium given in the figure as a

Let us find the area of the trapezium by adding the areas of the two triangles obtained
by drawing the diagonal AC of the trapezium.
Area of triangle ABC = 1

Area of trapezium ABCD = Area of triangle ABC + Area of triangle ACD
× AB × h + 1

If the area of the trapezium PQRS is 70 cm2, find the value
of h.
The area of the trapezium PQRS = 1

23.3 The area of a circle
We have learnt how to find the area of a lamina that takes the shape of a rectangle,
a square, a triangle, a parallelogram or a trapezium.
Now let us consider how the area of a circular shaped lamina can be found.
To do this, let us first engage in the activity given below.
Activity 2
Step 1 : Draw a circle of radius 6 cm on a sheet of paper.
Step 2 : Divide the circle into the maximum possible number of sectors (about
16) by drawing straight lines through the center.
Step 3 : Colour half the circle and number all the sectors consecutively as shown
in the figure.
Step 4 : Separate out all the sectors by cutting along the drawn lines.
For free distribution.
Step 5 : Paste the separated sectors such that a rectangular shape (approximately)
is obtained as shown in the figure. (Understand that the accuracy
increases as the number of sectors increases.)
Since paper is not wasted, the areas of the circle and the rectangle should be equal.
Find the area of the rectangle as shown below by considering the radius of the circle
as r.
The length of the rectangle that is obtained = circumference of the circle ×
= 2πr ×
The width of the rectangle that is obtained = r
The area of the rectangle = length × width
= πr × r
= πr2
∴ Therefore, the area of a circle of radius r = πr2
In calculations, we use 3.142 or
for the value of π.
Example 1
Find the area of a circular lamina of radius 14 cm.
14 cm
The area of the circular lamina = πr2
× 14 × 14
= 616
∴ Therefore, the area of the circular lamina is 616 cm2.
For free distribution.
Example 2
Calculate the radius of a circular lamina of area 154 cm2.
The area of the circular lamina = πr2
The area of the circular lamina is given as 154 cm2.
r2 = 154
Therefore, 22
r2 × 7 = 154 × 7
2 = 49
Therefore, r = 7 or r = − 7.
However, the radius cannot be a negative value.
Therefore, the radius of the circle is 7 cm.

Probability
By studying this lesson you will be able to;
• identify random experiments,
• write the sample space of a random experiment,
• identify the equally likely outcomes of a random experiment,
• find the probability of an event in a sample space when the outcomes are equally
likely.
24.1 Random experiment
Let us consider the experiment of an ordinary coin being tossed. When a coin is
tossed, we know that the outcome will be either “head turns up” or “tail turns up”.
That is, we know all the possible outcomes before the experiment is conducted.
However, we cannot say with certainly whether head will turn up or tail will turn
up. Furthermore, this experiment can be repeated any number of times under the
same conditions. Another feature is that we will not be able to identify a pattern in
the outcomes when the experiment is repeated. Experiments with the above features
are called random experiments.
Random experiments have the following common characteristics.
• The experiment can be repeated any number of times under the same conditions.
• All the possible outcomes of the experiment are known before the experiment is
carried out.
• The outcome of the experiment cannot be stated with certainty before the
experiment is carried out.
• When the experiment is repeated, a pattern cannot be recognized in the outcomes.
Let us consider another example.
Even though all the outcomes of the experiment of rolling an unbiased cubic die
with its faces numbered from 1 to 6 and recording the number on the face that turns
up are known, it is not possible before carrying out the experiment to state with
certainty which outcome will occur. Moreover, this experiment can be repeated any
number of times under the same conditions, but a pattern in the outcomes cannot be
expected. Therefore, rolling an unbiased cubic die and observing the outcome is a
random experiment.
For free distribution.
Exercise 24.1
1. For each of the following experiments, in the column to the right, mark —˜ if it
is a random experiment and —˜ if it is not a random experiment.
Experiment
Random/not random

numbered from 1 to 4, and recording the number on
the face which touches the table.
2. Drawing a bead from a bag which contains beads of
one color and recording its colour.
3. Throwing a ball at a target and observing whether it

4. Planting 5 radish seeds and recording the number of
seeds that germinate in 5 days.
5. Checking whether a door opens when a key picked

6. Tossing a ball in the air and observing whether it
falls to the ground.
7. Drawing out two cards from a box containing three
cards, each with one of the numbers 1, 3 and 5
written on it, and observing whether the sum of the
two numbers on the two cards that are drawn is an
odd number.
24.2 Sample Space
All the possible outcomes of a random experiment can be written as a set. This set
which consists of all the possible outcomes of a random experiment is called its
sample space. It is usually denoted by S.
For example,
in the experiment of tossing a coin and observing the side that turns up, the set of
all possible outcomes, that is, the sample space is S = {Head, Tail}. Here N (S) = 2.
Similarly, the sample space of the experiment of observing the number which turns
up when an unbiased cubic die with its faces numbered from 1 to 6 is rolled is
S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
Here N (S) = 6.
For free distribution.
Example 1
Write the sample space for the experiment of rolling an unbiased tetrahedral die
with its faces numbered from 1 to 4 and recording the number on the face which
touches the table.
S = ™1, 2, 3, 4š
Example 2
n(S) = 4
Write the sample space for the experiment of drawing a bead from a bag which
contains two black beads and three white beads marked B1, B2, W1, W2, W3
respectively, which are identical in all other aspects. What is the value of n(S)?
S = ™ B1, B2, W1, W2, W3 š
n(S) = 5
Example 3
There are two cards such that R is written on one side and Y is written on the other
side. The cards are tossed simultaniously and the letters turned up is recorded. Write
the sample space of this experiment.
Getting R on both cards is denoted by (R, R) and getting R on one card and Y on the
other is denoted as (R, Y) etc.. Accordingly,
S = ™(RR), (RY), (YR), (YY)š
Note: An event is a subset of the sample space of a random experiment.
Exercise 24.2
1. Write the sample space of each of the following experiments.
i. Randomly drawing a pen from a bag which contains one pen each of the
colors blue, red, black and green and recording the colour. (Assume that the
pens are identical in all aspects except the colour)
ii. Recording the number on the card that is drawn at random from a bag
containing eleven identical cards numbered 5 to 15.

For free distribution.
iv. A bag contains 4 milk flavoured toffees and 3 orange flavoured toffees of the
same size and shape. Randomly drawing a toffee and recording its flavour.
v. Recording the sides that turn up when a coin is tossed twice.
24.3 Equally likely outcomes
When the sample space of a random experiment is considered, if each outcome is
equally likely to occur, then that experiment is called an experiment with equally
likely outcomes. The outcomes of such an experiment are called equally likely
outcomes.
Let us consider a cubic die with its faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Let us assume
that the material it is made of is uniformly distributed throughout the die. Then it
is clear that due to symmetry, each face of the die has an equal chance of turning
up when the die is rolled. Similarly for a coin. Objects such as these which are
symmetrical and are made of a material which is uniformly distributed are called
unbiased or fair objects. Experiments such as these, of tossing a fair coin or rolling
an unbiased die are considered as important examples when it comes to explaining
the theory of probability.
Consider the experiment of rolling a cuboidal die with its faces marked, 1, 2, 3, 4,
5 and 6 and recording the number on the face that turns up. Here, the likelihood
of the different sides turning up may not be the same. Therefore such a die is not
considered to be a fair die. In such experiments, the outcomes are not equally likely.
Now let us consider another experiment.
It is clear that in the experiment of an unbiased cubic die with four faces painted
red and two faces painted blue being rolled and the colour of the face that turns
up being recorded, the chance of a red face turning up is greater than a blue face
turning up. Therefore, the outcomes of this experiments are not equally likely.
Exercise 24.3
1. For each of the following experiments, determine whether the outcomes are
equally likely or not.
i. The four faces of an unbiased tetrahedral die are painted in four different
colours, namely, red, blue, yellow and green. Recording the colour of the face

ground when a prism as shown in the figure, with its
sides marked with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 is rolled

v. Recording the colour of the card drawn randomly from a bag which contains
3 red cards and 4 blue cards which are identical in all other aspects.

fixed at the center of a circular disk points, when the disc

B, C, D, E, F, G and H as shown in the figure, is spun and
allowed to stop freely.
Recording the color on which the indicator (arrow) which
is fixed to the centre of the disc falls when it is spun and
allowed to stop freely. Here the disc is divided into unequal
sectors and shaded with different colours, and placed on a
horizon table top.
24.4 Probability of an event when the outcomes are equally likely
You have learnt that the probability of an outcome of a random experiment with
equally likely outcomes is given by the following.
Probability of a
selected outcome
total number of outcomes in the sample space of the random
experiment
Consider the experiment of rolling a fair die. Here the probability of a selected
outcome is 1
For example, the probability of getting 3 is 1
Now consider the event of getting an even number. Its probability can be calculated
as follows. Since there are three even numbers and three odd numbers, and the
For free distribution. outcomes of this experiment are equally likely, the probability of getting an even
number is 3
The probability of an event in the sample space of a random experiment with equally
likely outcomes is given by the following.
Probability of the
event
Number of elements in the event
Number of elements in the sample space
This can be written using symbols as follows.
If the number of elements in the sample space S is n (S), the number of elements in
the event A is n(A) and the probability of event A occurring is p(A), then
p (A) =
n (A)
n (S)
Now let us learn more by considering some examples.

is tossed once.

ii. If B is the event of getting an even number,

∴ p (B) =

∴ the probability of getting a number greater than 1 =

Angles of a Polygon
By studying this lesson you will be able to;
² solve geometrical problems related to the interior angles of a polygon,
² solve geometrical problems related to the exterior angles of a polygon,
² solve problems related to regular polygons.
A plane figure bounded by three or more straight line segments is known as a
polygon. The two main types of polygons are convex polygons and concave
polygons.
Convex Polygons
Concave Polygons
Some polygons have special names by which they are identified, which depend
on the number of sides they have. Accordingly, polygons which have 3, 4, 5 and 6
sides respectively are known as triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons and hexagons.
In previous grades you have learnt the following results on the sum of the interior
angles of a triangle and of a quadrilateral.
The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180o.
The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360o.
Do the following review exercise to further establish the above facts learnt on
polygons in previous grades.

25.1 The sum of the interior angles of a polygon
Let us first consider how to find the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral.
In the given figure, O is any point within the quadrilateral PQRS. By joining PO,
QO, RO and SO we obtain 4 triangles.
Since the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180o,
considering the triangle PQO we obtain, p + q + a = 180o,
considering the triangle QRO we obtain, r + s + b = 180o,
considering the triangle RSO we obtain, t + u + c = 180o,
considering the triangle SPO we obtain, v + w + d = 180o,
By adding these 4 equations we obtain,
(p + q + a) + (r + s + b) + (t + u + c ) + (v + w + d) = 180o 4
... (p + q + r + s + t + u + v + w) + (a + b + c + d) = 720o
Since a, b, c and d are angles around the point O, a + b + c + d = 360o .
... p + q + r + s + t + u + v + w
= 720o – 360o
= 360o
... the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360o'
Now, to obtain an expression in terms of n for the sum of the interior angles of a
polygon which has n sides, let us engage in the following activity.
For free distribution.

In the above activity, you must have obtained that when the number of sides is n,
the sum of the interior angles of the polygon is 180o n – 360o.
Let us write the expression 180o n – 360o as follows so that it is easier to remember.
180o n – 360o = 90o 2n – 90o 4
= 90o (2n – 4)

i. Consider the above table and find in terms of n, the number of triangles that
are formed by joining one vertex of an n-sided polygon to the other vertices
of the polygon.
ii. Show that the sum of the interior angles of a polygon of n sides is
180o (n – 2).
Note: Historically, mathematicians such as the Greek mathematician Euclid,
expressed the magnitudes of angles in terms of right angles. For example,
the magnitude of the angle on a straight line was said to be 2 right angles
and the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral was said to be 4 right
angles. Accordingly, we can say that the sum of the interior angles of a
polygon of n sides is 2n – 4 right angles. However, since we use degrees
to measure angles and are familiar with the fact that a right angle is 90o,
the sum of the interior angles of a polygon can be remembered as either
90o(2n – 4) or 180o(n – 2) or any other equivalent expression which is easy
to recall.
For free distribution.
Example 1
Find the sum of the interior angles of a nonagon.
Sum of the interior angles of a polygon of n sides = 180o (n – 2)
... the sum of the interior angles of a polygon of 9 sides = 180o (9 – 2)
= 180o 7
= 1260o
Example 2
Find the value of x based on the information in the figure.
Number of sides in the polygon = 7
... sum of the interior angles = 180o (7 – 2)
= 180o 5
= 900o
... 145o + 150o + 135o + xo + 130o + 140o + x = 900o
700o + 2x = 900o
2x = 900o – 700o
2x = 200o
x = 200o
= 100o
Example 3
The sum of the interior angles of a polygon is 1440°. Find the number of sides it
If the number of sides is n, the sum of the interior angles = 180o (n – 2)
... 180o (n – 2) = 1440o

180 = 8
n – 2 =
n – 2 = 8
n = 10

25.2 Sum of the exterior angles of a polygon
First, let us find the sum of the exterior angles of a triangle.
The side BC of the triangle ABC has been produced and point D has been marked
on the produced line. The angle ACD
, with the straight line segment CD and the
side AC as arms is an exterior angle of this triangle.
As indicated in the figure given below, by producing the side AC too we obtain an
exterior angle.
For free distribution.
Since vertically opposite angles are equal, this exterior angle is equal in magnitude
. Either of these two angles can be considered as the
to the exterior angle ACD
exterior angle drawn at the vertex C of the triangle. However, DCE
is not considered
as an exterior angle.
As done above, exterior angles can be drawn at the vertices A and B of the triangle
We can define the exterior angles of a quadrilateral similarly.
By producing the side SR of the quadrilateral PQRS up to A we obtain the exterior
angle QRA
and by producing the side QR up to B we obtain the exterior angle
. Since vertically opposite angles are equal, these two exterior angles are equal.
Furthermore, ARB
is not considered as an exterior angle.
We can define the exterior angles of any polygon similarly.
Now, through the following activity, let us determine a value for the sum of the
exterior angles of a polygon.
For free distribution.
Activity 3
Step 1: Draw a pentagon on a half sheet and name its exterior angles.
Step 2: Using a blade, cut out the exterior angles as laminas (in the form of
sectors of circles) and separate them. (By using the same radius when
drawing the sectors, the final outcome will be neat)
Step 3: On a sheet of paper, paste the laminas which were cut out, such that
their vertices meet at one point and such that they don’t overlap each
other.
Step 4: Carry out the above steps for a hexagon and a heptagon too.
Step 5: Write the common characteristic of the figures obtained by pasting
the exterior angles of the polygons and write what can be concluded
through this activity too.
You may have observed in the above activity that for each polygon, the exterior
angles cover the angle around a point. Accordingly, it can be concluded that the
sum of the exterior angles of a polygon is equal to the sum of the angles around a
point. As the sum of the angles around a point is 360°, the sum of the exterior angles
of the above polygons is also 360°.
For free distribution.
Now let us obtain an expression for the sum of the exterior angles of a polygon
which has n sides.
We know that the number of exterior angles and the number of interior angles of a
polygon with n sides is n.
At any vertex of a polygon,
the interior angle + the exterior angle = 180o.
... sum of n interior angles + sum of n exterior angles = 180o n'
But the sum of n interior angles = (2n – 4) right angles = 180°(n − 2). Therefore,
180o(n – 2) + sum of n exterior angles = 180on
... sum of n exterior angles = 180on – 180o(n – 2)
= 180on – 180on + 360o
= 360o
Sum of the exterior angles of a polygon = 360°
Example 1
Find the magnitude of the exterior angle indicated by x,
of the given pentagon.
Sum of the exterior angles = 360o
... x + 45o + 80o + 60o + 90o = 360o
x + 275o = 360o
x = 360o – 275o
x = 85o

i. Sum of the interior angles of the triangle EFG = 180o
... 80o + x + x = 180o
2x = 180o – 80o = 100o
x = 100o
x = 50o
ii. Sum of the exterior angles of the hexagon ABCDEG = 360o
... 70o + 80o + 3y + 2y + x + x = 360o
70o + 80o + 5y + 50o + 50o= 360o
5y = 360o – 250o
y = 110o
y = 22o
Example 3
The exterior angles of a quadrilateral are in the ratio 2 : 2 : 3 : 3. Find the magnitude
of each exterior angle.
Sum of the exterior angles = 360o
Ratio of the 4 angles = 2 : 2 : 3 : 3
... the smaller angles = 360x
10 = 72x
The larger angles = 360o
10 = 108o
∴ the exterior angles are 72o" 72o" 108o and 108o'

5. The exterior angles of a dodecagon are equal. Find the magnitude of any one
of these exterior angles.
6. The magnitude of an exterior angle of a polygon whose exterior angles are
equal is 18°. Find the number of sides the polygon has.
25.3 Regular Polygons
When all the sides of a polygon are equal in length and all the interior angles are
equal in magnitude, the polygon is known as a regular polygon.
All the sides of the pentagon ABCDE in the figure are equal.
All the interior angles are also equal. Therefore it is a regular
pentagon.
For free distribution.
All the sides of the pentagon PQRST are equal. However, all
the interior angles are not equal. Therefore, the pentagon
PQRST is not regular.
All the interior angles of the rectangle ABCD are equal.
However, all the sides are not equal. Therefore, it is not
a regular polygon.
Some regular polygons have special names. A regular triangle is called an
equilateral triangle. A regular quadrilateral is called a square.
Example 1
Find the magnitude of an exterior angle of a regular hexagon and thereby find the
magnitude of an interior angle.
Sum of the six exterior angles = 360o
... the magnitude of an exterior angle = 360o
exterior angle + interior angle = 180o
... 60° + interior angle = 180o
... interior angle = 180o – 60o
= 60o
= 120o
Example 2

i. the magnitude of an exterior angle.

Scale Diagrams
By studying this lesson you will be able to;
² identify bearings,
² draw a scale diagram of locations in a horizontal plane when bearings and distances
are given, and find unknown quantities using the scale diagram.
27.1 Bearing
Bearing is a measurement that is used to indicate a direction in a horizontal plane.
The bearing of the point B from the point A is the angle that the direction AB makes
with the direction of North when measured from A in a clockwise direction. The
following figures illustrate the bearing of B from A for different locations of A and
B. Observe that the bearing is given in three digits.
The bearing of B from A = 008
The bearing of B from A = 062o
The bearing of B from A = 135o
The bearing of B from A = 300
For free distribution.
Since a bearing is always less than 360°, the maximum number of digits it can have
is three. Therefore the norm is to always write bearings with three digits. If the
angle is one of 1o, 2o, ..., 9o, then the bearing is written as 001o, 002o, ..., 009o and if
the angle is one of 10o, 11o, ..., 99o, then it is written as 010o, 011o, ..., 099o.
Accordingly bearing is,
i. measured starting from the North,
ii. measured in a clockwise direction,
iii. written with three digits.
Since the North can be easily identified using a compass, bearings are used widely
in sea and air travel.
Let us broaden our knowledge on bearings by studying the examples given below.
Example 1
i. Indicate the four main directions (cardinal directions) in terms of bearings.
ii. Indicate the four sub-directions (intermediate directions) in terms of bearings.

Example 2
The bearing of B from A is 065o. Illustrate this information in a rough sketch and
find the bearing of A from B.
Since the bearing of B from A is 065o, the angle drawn from the direction of North
at A to the directionof AB in the clockwise direction is 65o.
Now, to find the bearing of A from B, a line needs to be drawn in the direction of
North from B, and the angle that is formed when this line is rotated in a clockwise
direction about B from the direction of North to the direction of BA needs to be
found.
The bearing of A from B
The lines drawn at A and B in the direction of North are parallel. The pair of allied
angles formed by the transversal AB intersecting these lines are supplementary.
Using this fact, the value 115o has been found. The required bearing is indicated in
the figure given above.
As the sum of the angles around a point is 360o "
the bearing of A from B = 360o
= 245o

ii. determine the bearing of A from B,
iii. determine the bearing of B from C.

example that we want to describe the location of B with respect to location A
and mark the direction of North on the tabletop.
² Place the clinometer on the tabletop such that the "0" on the clinometer is
towards the North.
² Rotate the straw until the location B is observed through the straw and measure
the clockwise angle of rotation from the direction of North. By writing it using
three digits, the bearing of B is obtained.
² By measuring the distance from A to B using a measuring tape, the position of
B can be described in terms of the distance and bearing from A.

Scale 1 : 1000

From Eapalathotuwa
Plan 2010
Scale 1 : 3300000
In every scale diagram, the scale to which the diagram is drawn is given, and the
direction of North is marked. It is very important to understand what is meant by
the scale (ratio) given in the scale diagram. For example, a scale of 1 : 500 000
means that a distance of 500 000 cm is represented by 1 cm in the scale diagram. In
500 000
th of
other words, the distance between two points on the scale diagram is
the actual distance between the two points. Moreover, since 500 000 cm is equal to
5 km, the actual distance represented by 1 cm in the scale diagram is 5 km.
Now let us learn how to draw scale diagrams by considering some examples.
Example 1
The vertices of a triangular floor area are A, B and C. The positions of the vertices
with respect to a point P located in this area is given below.
With respect to P,
For free distribution.
² A is located 30 m away on a bearing of 000o
² B is located 40 m away on a bearing of 120o
² C is located 45 m away on a bearing of 220o
Draw a scale diagram of the floor area using this information and find its perimeter.
Step 1: Mark the direction of North at the top right hand corner of the sheet of
paper.
Step 2: Draw a rough sketch as shown, based on the
information that is given.
Step 3: To represent the distances 30 m, 40 m and 45 m, select the scale of 1 cm
representing 10 m, that is, the scale of 1:1000.(Here, the scale should be
selected according to the size of the sheet of paper. Moreover, by selecting
a value such as 1000, anyone who is examining the scale diagram can
easily get an idea of the actual distances represented in it.)
Step 4: For each distance that is to be represented in the scale diagram, calculate
the corresponding length using the selected scale.
PA = 3000 ×
PB = 4000 ×
PC = 4500 ×
cm = 3 cm
cm = 4 cm,
cm = 4.5 cm
Step 5: Using a straight edge with a cm scale and a protractor, draw the scale
diagram with a pencil as shown below.
² First draw the line segment AP of length 3cm upwards.
² Draw the line segment PB of length 4 cm which makes an angle of 120
clockwise with PA.
² Draw the line segment PC of length 4.5 cm which makes an angle of 100o
clockwisewith PB.
For free distribution.
² Draw the line segments AB, BC and AC.
4.5 cm
Step 6: Measure the lengths of AB, BC and AC. You will see that AB = 6 cm,
AC = 7.1 cm and BC = 6.5 cm. Therefore the perimeter of the scale
diagram is 6 + 7.1 + 6.5 = 19.6 cm.
Step 7: Using the scale 1 cm
Perimeter of the floor = 10 × 19.6 = 196 m
10 m, calculate the actual length.
Example 2
A ship journeying from harbour P approaches harbour Q after travelling 100 km
on a bearing of 048o. It then travels 125 km on a bearing of 110
and approaches
harbour R. Draw a scale diagram and describe the position of R with respect to P.
Step 1: Based on the information given, draw a rough sketch as shown below.
100 k m
125 km
Step 2: Mark a point P on a sheet of paper and mark the direction of North upwards.
For free distribution.
² Since the bearing of Q from P is 048o, the angle that PQ makes with the direction
of North at P is 48o in the clockwise direction.
² Since the bearing of R from Q is 110o, the angle that QR makes with the direction
of North at Q is 110o in the clockwise direction.
Since the direction of North at P and the direction of North at Q are parallel, the
angle formed between the direction of North at Q and PQ is 132
Therefore, PQR
(allied angles)
= 360o − ( 132o + 110o)
= 360o − 242o
= 118o
Step 3: Select the scale of 1 cm representing 25 km, that is, 1: 2 500 000 to represent
the distances 100 km and 125 km in the scale diagram. (If there is space
on the sheet of paper, the scale of 1:1 250 000 can also be used).
Step 4: According to the selected scale, calculate the lengths of by which PQ and
QR are to be represented in the scale diagram.
cm = 4 cm, QR =
cm = 5 cm
(When drawing scale diagrams, the magnitudes of the angles do not change.)
Step 5: Draw the scale diagram using a straight edge, a protractor and a pencil,
based on the above measurements.
Step 6: When PR is measured, we obtain PR = 7.7 cm. When NPR
we obtain NPR
= 82o.
Step 7: Using the scale, calculate the actual length of PR.
Actual length of PR = 7.7 × 25 km
= 192.5 km
is measured,
For free distribution.
Step 8: The position of R can be described as follows.
R is situated 192.5 km from P on a bearing of 082o.

distribution,

In Grade 8 you learnt how to find the mode, median and mean of given raw data.
Do the following review exercise to recall what was learnt.

28.1 Ungrouped frequency distribution
To extract the information we require from a given set of raw data, we need to first
organize the data in a suitable way. For example, to find a representative value
such as the median of a set of raw data, the data needs to be arranged in ascending
or descending order.
When there are only a few values, they can easily be arranged in ascending or
descending order. However when the number of data is large, arranging them
in order and extracting information is not that easy. In such instances it is more
appropriate to use tables.
Let us consider such an instance.
The marks obtained in a test by the students of a certain class are given below.
42, 70, 68, 68, 56, 62, 74, 74. 74, 56, 62, 85, 91, 91, 74, 74, 56, 68, 68, 68, 74
This information can be tabulated as follows.
Note: This table can be easily and accurately constructed by using tally marks.

//// /
The frequencies are shown in the third column of this table.
Let us first consider what is meant by frequency.
For free distribution.
In the above data set, the value 42 occurs once, the value 56 occurs three time, etc.
The frequency of a value is the number of times that value occurs in the data set.
Accordingly, if we consider the above data set,
the frequency of 42 is 1,
the frequency of 56 is 3,
the frequency of 62 is 2, etc.
An ungrouped frequency distribution is a table containing the values of a data set
and their respective frequencies.
The following is an ungrouped frequency distribution prepared using the above
data set.

Students
(Frequency)
The mode of the data in an ungrouped frequency distribution
You have learnt in Grade 8 that the mode of a data set is the value that is repeated
the most in that data set. The largest value in the frequency column of the above
table is 6. The value corresponding to the frequency 6 is 74. Therefore the mode of
the above data set is 74.
The median of the data in an ungrouped frequency distribution
You have learnt that the median of a data set is the value that occurs in the middle
when the data is arranged in ascending or descending order.
There are 21 data in the above example. Therefore, when the data is arranged in
ascending or descending order, the value that occurs in the middle is the 11th value.
Now we need to find out what the 11th value is.
For free distribution.
Let us consider how this is done.
Observe from the above table that,
the 1st value is 42,
the 2nd value is 56,
the 3rd value is also 56,
the 6th value is 62.
Accordingly, the 11th value can be found by considering the sums of the values in
the frequency column as shown below.
Let us write the sums of the values in the frequency column by the side of the
frequency table.
Marks
Frequency
Sum of the frequencies
3 + 1 = 4
2 + 3 + 1 = 6
5 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 11
It can easily be seen by considering the sums of the frequencies in the frequency
column that the value in the 11th position is 68.
When there is a large number of data, arranging it in ascending or descending order
and identifying the middle value may not be very easy. The following method can
be used to identify the middle position (the position of the median).
Note: When the total number of data is an odd number, the middle position is
obtained from number of data + 1
The number of data in the above data set = 21
When the data is arranged in ascending order,
For free distribution.
the position where the median is located =
21 + 1
The value in the 11th position is 68. Therefore, the median of the data set is 68; that
is, the median of the marks is 68.
The mean of the data in an ungrouped frequency distribution
You have learnt in Grade 8 that to find the mean of a data set, the sum of all the data
values needs to be divided by the number of data values.
Let us see how the mean of the data in an ungrouped frequency distribution is found
by considering the above example.
As indicated previously, the value 42 occurs once, the value 56 occurs 3 times, etc.
To find the mean, the sum of all the values has to be found.
Let us use a table of the following form to find this sum.
Marks
Frequency
42 × 1 = 42
56× 3 = 168
62 × 2 = 124
68 × 5 = 340
70 × 1 = 70
74 × 6 = 444
85 × 1 = 85
91 × 2 = 182
21 1455
The sum of the data values = 1455
The mean of the data set =
= 69.29
∴the mean of the marks that the students obtained is 69 to the nearest whole
number.

There are 36 values in this data set. Since 36 is an even number, when this data set
is arranged in ascending or descending order, we obtain two middle values. In such
a case, the median of the data set is the average of the middle two values.
Let us first find the positions of the middle two values.
Note: When the total number of data is even, the positions of the middle two values
are obtained from number of data

b. The positions of the middle two values = 36

Therefore the middle two values are in the 18th and 19th positions.

The value in the 19th position = 24
∴ the median of the data set =

28.2 Grouped frequency distributions
In this section we will identify what a grouped frequency distribution is, the need
for grouped frequency distributions and how they are constructed.
To do this, let us consider the following example.
The marks obtained by a group of students in a certain test is given below.
The highest mark obtained is 83 and the lowest mark obtained is 21.
Therefore the range = 83 – 21 = 62.
For free distribution.
Since the range is large and there are many distinct data values, if we try to prepare
an ungrouped frequency distribution, we will end up with a fairly long table. In
such instances we consider the range of the data set and prepare a table of intervals
such that each data value belongs to exactly one of the intervals. These intervals
are called class intervals. A frequency distribution prepared using class intervals is
called a grouped frequency distribution.
The following is an example of a grouped frequency distribution.
Class Interval Frequency
10 - 19
20 - 29
30 - 39
40 - 49
This distribution has four class intervals.
Any data value which is equal to one of 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19
belongs to the class interval 10 – 19.
Since there are 10 values in the class interval 10 – 19, the class size (or class
width) is considered to be 10. The class sizes of the other class intervals are defined
similarly.
The frequency corresponding to the class interval 10 – 19 is 3. This means that the
data set has only 3 values belonging to this class interval.
Now let us consider how a grouped frequency distribution is prepared.
When preparing a grouped frequency distribution, we need to first decide on either
the size of the class intervals or the number of class intervals we want to have.
When we have decided on the size of the class intervals, the number of class
intervals can be obtained as follows.
• Find the range of the data set.
• Divide the range by the size of a class interval.
• The number of class intervals is the nearest whole number greater or equal to
the above obtained value.
For free distribution.
Consider the following example which was discussed earlier.
The marks obtained by a group of 30 students in a certain test are given below.
Suppose we want to separate this data set into class intervals of size 10.
Let us first find the number of class intervals.
The largest value of this data set = 83
The smallest value of this data set = 21
The range = 83 – 21
Since we want the size of the class intervals to be 10,
the number of class intervals = 62
= 6.2
7 (when rounded off to the nearest whole number
greater than the obtained value)
Accordingly, if we take the class size to be 10, we obtain a grouped frequency
distribution with 7 class intervals.
Since the smallest value in the data set is 21, let us prepare the frequency distribution
starting with the value 20. The first class interval will then consist of the ten integers
20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29. The next class interval will consist of the
next 10 integers and so on.
Accordingly, we obtain the following class intervals.
20 - 29
30 - 39
40 - 49
50 - 59
60 - 69
70 - 79
80 - 89
For free distribution.
Note: Although we commenced the first class interval from 20, we could have
started with the value 21 too (or some other suitable value). If we started
with 21, the class intervals would have been 21 – 30, 31 – 40, 41 – 50, etc.
Now, let us find the number of values that fall into each class interval by using tally
marks.
Class Interval
(Marks)
20 - 29
30 - 39
40 - 49
50 - 59
60 - 69
70 - 79
80 - 89
Tally Marks
Frequency
//// ///
//// ////
Note: It is not necessary to include the tally marks column in a frequency
distribution.
When we have decided on the number of class intervals, we can find the size of the
class intervals (class size) as follows.
• Find the range of the data set by subtracting the smallest value of the data set
from the largest value.
• Divide the range by the number of class intervals. (In general, the number of
class intervals is taken to be less than 10.)
• Round off the value that is obtained to the nearest whole number greater or
equal to it and take this value to be the size of the class intervals.
Let us consider how to construct a grouped frequency distribution with 5 class
intervals using the above data set. Let us first find the size of the class intervals.
For free distribution. The largest value of this data set = 83
The smallest value of this data set = 21
The range = 83 – 21
Since we require 5 class intervals,
the size of each class interval =
= 12.4
13 (nearest whole number greater than the obtained
value)
Accordingly, we prepare a grouped frequency distribution with 5 class intervals of
size 13.
Class Interval
Frequency
20 - 32
33 - 45
46 - 58
59 - 71
72 - 84
As shown above, we can construct grouped frequency distributions according to
our requirements, based on the given data set.
Consider the first grouped frequency distribution we constructed. We took 20 - 29
as the first class interval, 30 – 39 as the second class interval, etc. We were able to
do this because there were no values between 29 and 30 or between 39 and 40, etc.
Observe that this feature is seen in the second grouped frequency distribution we
constructed too.
However, if we have a data set consisting of values which are lengths or times or
masses, it is necessary to start the second class interval with the value that the first
class interval ends, to start the third class interval with the value that the second
class interval ends, and so on.
For free distribution.
Let us now consider such an example.
The masses of 20 students in a class are given below to the nearest kilogramme.
Let us construct a grouped frequency distribution with 4 class intervals of size 3
each.
Let us take the first class interval as 30 – 33, the next class interval as 33 – 36, etc.
30 - 33
33 - 36
36 - 39
39 - 42
Here, the second class interval commences with the same value that the first class
interval ends. The reason is because the data set consists of masses and masses
need not be integral values. For example, we may have students whose masses are
33.2 kg, 33.5 kg, 33.8 kg, etc., which are between 33 kg and 34 kg, or 36.5 kg,
36.9 kg, etc., which are between 36 kg and 37 kg etc. Therefore, in such situations,
each class interval needs to commence with the same value that the previous class
interval ends (except for the first class interval).
Here, the first class interval ends with 33 and the second class interval commences
with the same value 33. A question arises as to which class interval the value 33
belongs. The value 33 can be taken to belong to either one of these two intervals.
However, it is important to state the convention that is being used.
In this lesson we will consider the class intervals to be as follows.
Here,
the values greater than 30 but less than or equal to 33 belong to the class interval
30 -33,
the values greater than 33 but less than or equal to 36 belong to the class interval
33 – 36,
the values greater than 36 but less than or equal to 39 belong to the class interval
36 – 39, and
the values greater than 39 but less than or equal to 42 belong to the class interval
39 – 42.
For free distribution.
The grouped frequency distribution prepared according to this convention is given
below.
Class Interval
Frequency
30 - 33
33 - 36
36 - 39
39 - 42
Note: When constructing a grouped frequency distribution, it should be
remembered that the class intervals need to be selected by taking the
nature of the data into consideration.

28.3 Finding the modal class and median class from a grouped
frequency distribution
We learnt how to construct a grouped frequency distribution in the previous section.
Now let us consider how the modal class and the median class can be found from a
grouped frequency distribution.
When we are given a grouped frequency distribution, we will not be able to identify
the mode and the median as the raw data is not available to us. In such situations
we consider the modal class and the median class.
The modal class is the class interval with the highest frequency. The median class
is the class interval to which the median belongs.
Example 1
A grouped frequency distribution prepared with the marks obtained by a group of
students in a certain test is given below.
From this distribution, find
i. the modal class
ii. the median class.
For free distribution.

21 - 30
31 - 40
41 - 50

61 - 70
Frequency
Sum of the frequencies
i. Since the highest frequency is 11, the modal class is 51 – 60.
ii. The position of the median of the data set =
35 + 1
The median class is the class interval to which the 18th value belongs. Therefore,
the median class is 41 - 50.
Example 2
A grouped frequency distribution prepared using the ages of the employees of a
certain establishment is given below.
Find,
i. the modal class
ii. the median class.
20 - 27

34 - 41
41 - 58
48 - 55
Frequency
Sum of the frequencies
i. The highest frequency = 11
∴ the modal class = 34 − 41
The positions of the middle two values =
2 and
2 + 1
= 14 and 15
For free distribution.
The class interval that contains the 14th value = 34 − 41
The class interval that contains the 15th value = 34 − 41
∴ the median class 34 - 41'
