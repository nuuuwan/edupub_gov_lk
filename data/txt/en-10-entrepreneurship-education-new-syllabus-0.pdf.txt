1.1 Concept of Entrepreneurship
Entrepreneurship can be explained as the manner in which people see,think, and
act rationally about different incidents in the environment.Entrepreneurship is a
practical concept.Therefore,it is somewhat difficult to describe in words.It has a
long history similar to the origin of mankind.
Read the following story well to understand the concept of entrepreneurship.
The Story of Sunimal
My dear sons and daughters, Earlier I have related the stories of the heroes who
lived in the past. But today I'm going to relate you a story of a hero who still lives.
His name is Sunimal. He was one of my students in this school and a good child
like you. He was very talented in his studies. But he always thought differently
to that of others. He always questioned about what he saw and about things that
took place.
One day I questioned all the children about their ambition. Even though other
children mentioned several lucrative jobs, Sunimal said some thing different. " I
can't say that exactly now, teacher. I will do something different to that of others
" said Sunimal. In one particular year, each class made vesak lanterns. Sunimal
made a beautiful lantern using coconut husks. Next year, he made a small vesak
pandal which consumes less electricity using electric bulbs. Another day, he made
a rotating machine to remove cobwebs using batteries, wire, pipes and a motor.
One day his mother said " Sunimal is very lazy to do home work. But his room
is fully loaded with wires and parts of old radios and T.Vs. He assembles and re
fixes them" I told his mother" he got sufficient marks for the subjects at school
and he would come to a good position."
Later, he made a machine using a motor for digging the earth and a machine to
mow grass. Later on,he left this school and joined another to do his Advanced
Level Examination. Do you know his present position? He is non other than
the owner of " Shakthi Builders" over there. Now he is 30 years old. Above fifty
employees work under him in his business. He has already won the local market.
He leads a decent life serving his school and the society. He who tried to create
different things at school, has gained an advanced technological competency
even to produce backhoe machines, mowers and tree cutting machines. He has
made his teachers and parents proud. Isn't he a hero of our time? "

You might have heard similar stories like this through print media. Furthermore,you
might have seen or heard about such personalities on electronic media like television.
Let's try to understand the following characteristics of entrepreneurship from
the character of Sunimal.
V Try to make a change while being vigilant on the current things
V Possess a hopeful future dream
V Try to initiate new ideas and concepts
V Continue to work on such initiatives
V Lay a firm foundation for a successsful business
V Lead a decent life while contributing positively for the betterment of the
society
If we summarize the above characteristics, Sunimal can be identified as an
exemplary entrepreneur.
Experts and researchers have expressed various ideas and concepts on
entrepreneurship.
Accordingly, entrepreneurship is,
c A mentality that motivates people to change the future
c It is a way of logical thinking and acting
c It is a collection of attitudes, behaviours and skills of persons
c It is related to human mind (A mentality)

mind (mentality) and act or behave accordingly. It is to
think differently. It is to create innovations identifying the
opportunities in the environment. It is to take risks.

view.
Entrepreneurship is the ability to identify a suitable business idea and convert it into
a practicable business enterprise. Creativity, innovation and ability to take risks are
important factors in the course of changing a business idea into a business. In this
process, there may be success or failure in the business.Simply it can be identified
as a risk.When an idea is put into practice, it is important to act according to a plan
with objectives. What ever challenges or pitfalls there are in achieving objectives,
the efforts should not be given up. You may confront obstacles and difficulties in
achieving objectives, but the effort should never be given up.

1.3 Specific Importance of Entrepreneurship
You have collected a lot of information on entrepreneurship by now. You have
learnt that the ability of a person to convert ideas into activities is known as
entrepreneurship. Such ideas are developed as innovations by entrepreneurs. Their
ideas are creative. Innovations refer to the activity of producing new goods and
services. Various resources are required to produce goods and services.
These resources are divided into 4 main factors of production as follows.
Y Land
Y Labour
Y Capital
Y Entrepreneurship
Let's study each factor of production in brief.
All the natural resources including the
raw materials required for production are
known as land.
Example :-
Raw materials, land,
forests and soil
The physical and psychological energy
used for production is known as labour.
Example :-
The labour of an engineer
The labour of a carpenter
engaged in the production
of furniture
All the man made resources required for
the production are called capital.
Example :-
Buildings
Machines
Equipment

A production does not take place only with the factors like land, labour and capital.
Therefore, the entrepreneurship is required to produce goods and services and to
market them by blending these factors according to the requirement. The decision
maker is the entrepreneur. He makes the decisions, on the type of goods and services
to be produced, the amount and how the production factors are to be blended etc.
Thus,when compared with other factors of production, you can understand the
specific importance of entrepreneurship.
Entrepreneurs are essential to convert resources into goods and services that are
required to fulf il human needs.

Let's see what creativity means
Creativity can be defined as the ability to develop new
ideas and discover new ways to solve problems
and issues using available opportunities.
Look at your environment carefully. How many issues and opportunities are there
for you?
Figure 1.3
Example :-
There are issues such as heaviness of the school bag,uncomfortable
chairs, taking the breakfast, rain, mosquitoes. There is a solution
too, for every issue. They are solutions which come to your mind. If
you put those ideas into practice, you can create new products.

Factors that obstruct creativity
You will have to face various barriers when finding solutions in a creative manner.
Several such barriers are shown below.
i. Relying firmly on beliefs and attitudes
ii. Thinking that there is only one solution for a particular issue
iii. Anticipating instant results
iv. Not acting on logical basis
v. Thinking that there are barriers to be practical
vi. Following rules, regulations and traditions ignorantly
vii. Fear of mistakes and criticisms
Let us examine the barriers mentioned above in brief.
i. Relying firmly on beliefs and attitudes
Most of the people rely too much on their beliefs and try to take decisions on what
they say and do. They think negatively before doing something and fear that it is
impossible to complete the task.
Example :-
Believing that it is impossible for women to do certain jobs.
ii. Thinking that there is only one solution.
Some people have the habit of thinking that there is only one solution for any issue.
Actually, it is difficult to find an issue which has only one solution.
Example :-
There are various solutions for preventing the inconveniences
caused by mosquitoes.
iii. Anticipating instant results.
Some anticipate instant results for what they do. But the result of creativity may
take a long time than expected. The seed of ideas originates in the minds of people
and takes time to grow in to a strong tree.
Example :-
It took a long time to succeed the journey to the moon

iv. Not acting on logical basis
It is a barrier to creativity when people try to find solution on traditions. A lot of
new products can be created with logical thinking.
Example :-
In the past, it was assumed that going to the bank for transactions
was compulsory but it is not so today.
v. Thinking that there are barriers to be practical
Some people tend to think that certain things are not practical and they are
discouraged to proceed, because of this.
Example :-
Airplanes were invented by abandoning the concept that it was not
possible to fly any object which is heavier than the wind.
vi. Following rules, regulations and traditions ignorantly
There are various norms and traditions in the society. Some people misunderstand
such norms and traditions and form their own limits. This is a barrier to the creativity
of people.
Example :-
Take three meals a day
Sleep at night
Keep the shops open only during the day time
vii. Fear of mistakes and criticism
The creative ideas of the entrepreneurs have succeeded not by implementing them
in haste.
There are lots of mistakes, failures and criticisms behind the success of the
entrepreneurs. The entrepreneurs consider failures as experiences.
Example :-
If Thomas Alva Edison had feared the mistakes and criticisms, we
will not be able to see the electric bulb which had failed 999 times.

in the environment.
ii. Accepting failures
The result of creativity may be a success or a
failure. But you must have the ability to accept
the failures. Furthermore you must not be in a
hurry to achieve the results.

Curiosity is the main cause of new discoveries.
People make new inventions and creations
based on curiosity.

Activity 05
Sanoma Hotel is situated in a main city. It supplies high quality food and drinks
required by hotels and restaurants. Often it is full of customers. Everyday, there is
a long queue in the evening to buy food. As the discharge of left overs and waste
water is harmful to the environment, a bio gas unit has been produced. It provides
the necessary electricity to the hotel. Therefore the owner can earn a good profit by
selling the goods and services at a reasonable price.
(1) Read the above description well and state the creative idea and innovation
of the owner of the hotel.
(2) What are the benefits obtained by the entrepreneur?
(3) List 10 new goods and services you know.
Activity 06
Write 05 examples of ways by which new products can be created.
03. Taking risks
There is a risk when an entrepreneur creates a new product. The new product may
succeed or fail in the market. There is a similar risk when a new business is started.
There is a probability of success or failure of the business. It is a financial risk. We
can't exactly say whether we would get a sufficient profit for the money invested in
the business. The main reason for the risk is uncertainty.
Example :-
You will get the money and the interest for the cash deposited in a
bank which is approved by the Central Bank. But if you invest your
money in a place which cannot be trusted, you may not even get the
money that you have invested.
The relationship between the risk and the profit can be shown as follows.
High risks High profit
Low risks low profit

Entrepreneurs do not like to take high risks expecting a high profit as the gamblers
do. At the same time entrepreneurs would not like to get a low profit by not taking
a risk. Here the entrepreneurs evaluate the risk and take only the bearable risk.
04. Future vision
Future vision is the dream that
is expected to be realized in the
future. It is important that we all
have a vision. As a student you
should have a vision too. Try to
remember the story of Sunimal
which you have already studied.
His vision was to do something
different. Accordingly, by forming
different objectives and goals, you
can achieve success in the future.
Figure 1.6
An entrepreneur is a person who always tries to make a change with a creative
mind.At present, he would see his future position and the nature of the business.
His vision is to make a positive change in the society through his own success and
the success of his business.
All the activities are directed on the basis of the vision of the individual and the
business.
05. Sensitivity towards the environment and identifying
opportunities.
Entrepreneurs are always mindful of their environment. Therefore they are aware
of the changes in the environment and able to respond to them, appropriately.
Example :-
Women are employed in various jobs. Identifying the business
opportunities that have been created due to their busy life.

06. Being optimistic
An entrepreneur thinks and does everything
with a positive attitude. He always thinks
positively. He is not backward and does
not have a negative mind at all. He sees a
pleasant dream about the future. He accepts
unsuccessful failures and challenges in a
positive way. Many people would see this as
half empty but the one who thinks positively
sees it as half full.
Figure 1.7
07. Possess the confidence that success depends on his
own ability.
An entrepreneur works with self confidence. He would not wait until luck comes
to him but believes thoroughly that his hardwork brings him success. He has the
prior preparation to face any type of challenge. He believes that his successes and
failures entirely depend on his amount of commitment. He believes that his destiny
rests on him. He would not assign his success and failures to any unseen power.
Air pilot Jesica Cock can be sighted as a recent example. She says,
" I was born handless. But
having no regret about that,
I concentrated to learn what
I could do with my two legs. I
involved with commitment in
training of piloting aeroplanes.
At the end, I was successful in
achieving my aim of becoming
a pilot "

08. Tendency towards achieving difficult objectives
An entrepreneur would work realistically to achieve his objectives. His objectives
are clear. He would act directly to achieve his objectives. He wouldn't be
disappointed on his failures or shortcomings. He would not be sad. There may be
failures, pitfalls, drawbacks and sadness behind the success of any entrepreneur. It
is a special quality of an entrepreneur because he accepts it as normal and takes as
experience and acts with interest to achieve any difficult objective.
Read the statement of the famous scientist Thomas Alva Edison. Realize how
entrepreneurs act to achieve difficult objectives.
" I have not failed. But I've found 999 ways that a light bulb will not work "
Thomes A. Edison
''I have not failed,
I 've just found 999
ways that a light bulb will not
work''
Thomas A. Edison.
Figure 1.9
09. Independent
An entrepreneur is a person with self control. He always likes to have an independent
opinion. He prefers to be his own master. An entrepreneur expects to work on his
own and takes decisions. He respects the opinions of others but when it comes to
taking decisions, he does not rely on others. He has the ability to decide and control
his own destination.

10. Flexibility
This means the ability to adapt to the
environmental changes. Entrepreneurs
are ready to adapt to the environmental
changes. He adjusts his path according
to the changes in the environment.
You may have seen some people who
follow strict policies. They don't like
to change their decisions, manners,
opinions and perceptions. Some still
live in the past. They fail to face the
upcoming challenges forgetting what
had happened in the past.
If entrepreneurs act strictly in this

way from my childhood. Even though I was rearing ornamental fish as my
hobby, neighbours used to buy fish from me. I bought more ornamental fish from
the income I received and produced more and more fish. I made fish tanks too.
Sasini :- About your education?
Samith :- After I passed the G. C. E. Advanced Level examination, I worked in a
private firm. At the same time I thought of expanding the business. I
bought ornamental fish in bulk from breeding centres. I followed a course
in aqua culture to improve my knowledge. That course of study helped me
a lot to expand my business.
Sasini :- If you say something about your business ?
Samith :- In the meantime, I had to change my residence to southern region to which
I got a transfer. I realized that there was a good demand for ornamental fish in
the area. But there is no suitable business places available in the area.
There was a high demand for ornamental fish tanks. So I started selling
fish tanks with ornamental fish in a building rented in the city. That is how
“ Ruhunu Aquariums” was formed.
Sasini :- It is a good example for the new generation. Who else helped you apart
from your parents and sisters in this endeavour?
Samith :- I received knowledge and financial assistance from various government
institutions.
Sasini :- You are involved in another business while working. How do you find time for this.?
Samith :- I am not a lazy person . My employees also work very hard with dedication.
After work I help in the household work and involve in production
activities during my spare time. All this is done according to my own plan.
Sasini :- As a person who conquered life and lot of challenges can you tell us
about your plan for the future?
