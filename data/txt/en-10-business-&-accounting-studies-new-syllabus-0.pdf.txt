1.1 Basic Concepts about Businesses
When the social existence of a human develops, individual needs also widened
gradually. When the needs and wants were diversified, it was difficult to produce all
their needs and wants by themselves. As a remedy to this problem, people started to
produce a large quantity of goods that they could produce the best, with the skills
and resources they had. Therefore, an excess of goods was created. Then people
exchanged their excess goods with others to obtain other goods they wanted. This
system of exchanging goods was known as the 'Barter System'.
Even today, no one produces all what he or she wants. The farmer produces rice; the
carpenter makes furniture; the teacher teaches. This individual is either a producer
or a consumer in different instances. Such producers and consumers fulfill their
needs and wants through businesses. Therefore, businesses are given immense
importance in the modern society.
Business Concept
Man needs goods and services from birth to death. These needs and wants are
fulfilled by the businesses. Businessmen manufacture and distribute various
goods and services according to the human needs and wants. The way businesses
manufacture and distribute goods and services and the way man fulfills his needs
and wants have become different and complex today.
A business is an economic activity which manufactures or provides different goods
and services in order to fulfill human needs. Most of the firms are profit oriented
whereas some firms are not profit oriented. Especially, most of the businesses in the
government sector are driven by the social welfare motive. Even though a majority
of private sector businesses are driven by the profit motive, some firms are also
driven by the welfare motive.
A majority of production activities carried out manually in the past are now carried
out using new technology. Most of the businesses do their transactions through
electronic media. Therefore, today, any business activity such as ordering goods,
paying money and advertising etc can be performed rapidly and easily through
electronic media. Due to the accelerating growth in information and communication
technology, the world has become a global village through electronic media. Any
individual in any country is now consuming different goods produced in different
countries in order to fulfill their needs and wants. The following activity will
facilitate you to understand the extent to which your daily life has been connected
to the global market today.

Business Objectives
As a consumer your objective is to obtain
a quality product at a reasonable price to
satisfy a need. Similarly, consumers and
other different stakeholders of businesses
have specific objectives to be fulfilled. Every
business has a specific objective or set of
objectives to be achieved, because the parties
such as owners of a business, its managers,
employees, customers, government and
community expect different returns from a
business.

It is required to consider the scale of a business when selecting a type of business
organization. Determining the scale of a business depends on several factors. The
financial strength, skills and experiences and various relationships of the owner are
some of the major factors. In addition, the quantity of goods and services produced
by the business, market share of the respective product will also be considered
when deciding the scale of the business. Accordingly, there are two major types of
businesses that can be identified based on the scale.
Y Small scale businesses
Y Large scale businesses
Small scale businesses
Businesses are generally started as small scale businesses. Most of the small scale
businesses are sole proprietorships. The ease of starting with less capital, with less
legal influences are some reasons for selecting sole proprietorships.

by the businessman, experiences obtained by working in other businesses,
network of relationships that stimulate businesses and with the infrastructure
facilities and other incentives provided by the government.

management activities
Management is a process of planning, organising, leading and controlling the
resources of a business in order to achieve the objectives of a business.
A sole proprietorship will be managed by its owner. He can take all the decisions
of the business independently. In addition, he will be the owner, leader as well as
the manager of the business. As the owner, he has the freedom to take decisions
regarding the sources of a business.
If a business is expected to be managed by a group of individuals, a partnership or
an incorporated company would be the appropriate type. Here, decisions can be
taken with the consent of all partners or the directors of the board.
3.3 Registration of a sole proprietorship
If a sole proprietorship is conducted in a different name other than the full name of
its owner, it is mandatory to register the name of the business.

personality for the business.

4.1 Accounting
Accounting can be explained as a process of providing information required by the
interested parties of a business for their decision making. Financial information is
very important in decision making in a business. Accounting that mainly provides
financial information is called as Financial Accounting.
4.2 Objectives and need of Accounting
As mentioned above, Accounting is needed to provide useful information to
interested parties of a business for their decision making. Further, the business
activities also impact various other parties. All these parties including owners and
debt holders are named as interested parties (stakeholders) of a business. Owners,
debt holders, investors, customers, suppliers, employees and the government are
usually considered as key interested parties among other parties. Each party takes
decisions in various nature and for that they require information. Accordingly,
providing information for decesion making is the main objective of accounting.
Based on this main objective, there are various other objectives and few of such
objectives are given below.
To know whether the business has earned an adequate profit
To know whether the financial position of the business is sound
To fulfill legal requirements (presentation of financial reports is a
mandatory requirement by law for some organisations)
To minimize disadvantages arising through ommission and commission
of transactions, and to organize financial activities
In order to fulfill above objectives, accounting provides various types of reports to
the interested parties. These reports are generally termed as Financial Statements.
These financial statements are based on business transactions.
For free distribution
4.3 Business transactions
When a business carries out its activities, it requires to exchange resources with
various parties. For example, when a business purchases goods on cash basis, cash
and goods are exchanged between the business and the supplier. Accordingly, a
transaction can be identified as an exchange of resources between a business and
other parties.
In a business, there can be various types of transactions. Among those transactions,
the transactions of which their value can be measured in terms of money, are
considered in accounting.
Examples :-
Sales of goods for Rs 100 000
Monthly salary payment of Rs 50 000
Obtain a bank loan of to Rs 300 000
Electricity payment of Rs 5 000
In addition, to the exchange of resources mentioned above, some events that had
occurred in businesses are also considered in accounting.
Examples :-
Damage of trade stocks - Rs. 10 000
A trade receivable that becomes a bad debt - Rs. 3 000
These events are also considered as transactions in a broader sense in accounting.
Most of the transactions that occur in a business are associated with purchases
and sales of goods and providing services. Such transactions could be made either
on cash or credit basis. If the value of the transaction is settled at the point of the
transaction, it will be considered as a transaction on cash basis. On the other hand,
if the settlement is made later, it will be considered as a transaction on credit basis.
4.4 Assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses, that
arise from various transactions
As a result of transactions following accounting elements arise.
Assets
Liabilities
Equity
Income and Expenses.
For free distribution
Assets
The resources that are generated as a result of a past transaction are simply called
assets.
Examples :-
Purchase of a machine by a business
Purchase of a motor vehicle by a business
In order to recognize an asset in accounting reports, its cost/value should be able
to be measured reliably. Assets generate future economic benefits to the business.
Examples :-
If a machine that had been purchased by a business is used to
manufacture and sell goods, the cash that flows to the business in
future from that machine.
The profits that are generated by the future sale of purchased stocks.
If any item does not generate future economic benefits, that item cannot be
considered as an asset. Further, the item should be controlled by the business. This
means, the business should be able to use that asset according to the discretion of
the business and to take decisions on the asset. For example, the above mentioned
machine and the stock should be able to be used by the business according to the
discretion of the business. A building on a rental basis cannot be considered as an
asset as it is not controllable by the business.
The following characteristics are observed of an asset.
Arose as a result of a past transaction
Controlled by the business
Inflow of future economic benefit to the business
Accordingly,
an asset could be defined as follows.
An asset is a resource controlled by the business as a result of a past transaction
and from which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the business.

Current Assets
Non-current Assets
Current Assets
The assets that are expected to be used, sold or converted into cash within a short
time period as 12 months in the ordinary activities of a business are classified as
current assets.
Examples :-
Stocks to be resold, Trade receivable that needs to be
recovered within 12 months.
Non-current Assets
All the assets that cannot be considered as current assets are considered as
non-current assets.
Examples :-
Land and buildings, machinery, furniture, equipment, motor vehicles.
Liabilities
Payables of a business that had arose as a result of past transactions could be
simply considered as liabilities.
Examples :-
A loan obtained from a bank
The business is bound to repay these liabilities in future. Therefore, these are
considered as current obligations.When these liabilities are settled, the resources
which generate future economic benefits (assets) will flow out from the business.
Further, in order to show a liability in the accounts, its amount should be able to be
measured reliably.

Examples :-
Bank loans, Trade creditors
Liabilities also can be categorised into two types as follows.
Current Liabilities
Non-current Liabilities
Current Liabilities
The liabilities that should be settled within a short period of time as within 12
months are classified as current liabilities. These are also termed as short-term
liabilities.
Examples :-
Trade creditors that arise when goods are purchased on credit for
resale, accrued electricity expense.
Non-current Liabilities
All of the liabilities that cannot be considered as current liabilities are
classified as non-current liabilities.
Example :-
The portion of a bank loan that needs to be settled after one year.
For free distribution
Equity
If the business has liabilities, a part of its assets has to be used to settle those
liabilities. After the settlement of such liabilities the assets that remain belongs to
the owners of the business.
The value of assets that belongs to owners of the business is termed as equity.
Example :-
Let us assume that a business has Rs. 500 000 worth of assets and a
bank loan amounting to Rs. 200 000. Rs. 200 000 out of Rs. 500 000
of assets has to be used to settle the bank loan and therefore, the
remaining of assets worth of Rs. 300 000 belongs to the owners.
Equity
Assets
Rs 500 000
Rs 300 000
Liabilities
Rs 200 000
In a sole proprietorship, the capital invested represents the equity.
Income and Expenses
Profit of a business is the difference between income and expenses.
Accordingly,
Profit =
Income - Expenses
Profit belongs to the owners of the business. Therefore, profit must be added to the
equity. Profit can be calculated separately and thereby it can be added to the equity.
Alternatively, income could be added to the equity and expenses could be deducted
from the equity. In other words, equity is increased by income and decreased by
expenses.
As mentioned above, income belongs to the owners. Therefore, it should be added
to the equity. As a result, equity increase. However, an increase of equity does not
occur only from receipt of income. When owners bring additional capital to the
business it causes to increase the equity. This increase in equity is not considered
as income.
Therefore, income can be defined as an increase in equity except due to the increases
from capital introductions by owners.
For free distribution
Examples :-
K Sales
K Interest received
K Rent received
K Commission received
As income belongs to the owners, expenses should also be born by the owners.
Therefore, expenses should be deducted from the equity and it causes to reduce the
equity. However, a decrease of equity does not occur only from expenses. When
owners take goods or cash out of the business for their private use (which is termed
as drawings), equity decreases.
Therefore, expenses can be defined as a reduction in equity except due to
drawings.
Examples :-
K Salaries and wages
K Insurance expenses
K Cost of goods sold
K Interest expenses
The difference between income and expenses is identified as the profit or loss. If
it is a profit, it belongs to owners and if it is a loss, owners have to bear that as
well. Therefore, profit or loss should be ultimately adjusted to the equity. Then,
what remain are assets, liabilities and equity. The relationship among these assets,
liabilities and equity could be shown in an equation. This equation is named as
the Accounting Equation. You can learn about the accounting equation in the next
chapter.

For free distribution
5.1 Accounting equation
The assets and the ownership of those assets of a business are shown in accounting
records of that business. All assets should belong to some party of the business.
Therefore, assets of a business should be equal to the total ownership of those assets. To
show this relationship, an equation is used, which is called as the Accounting Equation.
5.2 Construction of accounting equation
If all assets are financed by the owner of the business, the accounting equation can
be presented as follows.
Assets
Equity
Example :-
Amal started a business investing Rs.500 000 in cash. Here, assets
(cash) of the business is equal to Rs. 500 000 and this total amount
belongs to the owner, Amal. Accordingly,
Assets
Cash 500 000
Equity
Capital 500 000
When a business expands, the resources invested by owners would not be adequate.
Therefore, the business will have to obtain resources from external parties. When
the business borrows money, liabilities arise. When there are liabilities in the
business, a part of its assets belong to debt holders. Remaining of the assets belongs
to owners. In such a situation, accounting equation can be built as follows.
Assets =
Equity
Liabilities
Example :-
With reference to the above example, if Amal had obtained a bank
loan of Rs. 300 000, assets of Amal's business are increased by
Rs. 300 000 (cash). On the other hand, it increases liabilities
(bank loan) of the business by Rs. 300 000.
Accordingly, the accounting equation including the second transaction is now
depicted as,
Assets
Cash 800 000
Equity
= Capital 500 000
+ Liabilities
+ Bank loan 300 000
For free distribution
5.3 How do business transactions affect the accounting equation
The value of assets, liabilities and equity are changed due to business transactions.
Accordingly, the accounting equation changes due to the business transactions. Let
us understand these changes using the following examples.
Example 1 :-
Owner invested Rs. 800 000 as capital.
Asset
Cash 800 000
Equity
= Capital 800 000
Liabilities
Example 2 :-
Purchased furniture for Rs. 100 000.
The accounting equation changes as follows,
Assets
Furniture + Cash
Balance at the - + 800 000 =
beginning
Equity
Capital
800 000

6.1 Dual impact of business transactions
Many transactions occur daily in a business. As a result of these transactions,
the values of assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses are changed. In
accounting, these changes are identified as a dual impact of a transaction. As
explained earlier, each transaction causes change to two items of the accounting
equation. This is termed as the dual impact of a transaction.
Examples :-
Investing Capital
Purchase of furniture Asset (furniture ) increases Asset (cash) decrease
Payment of Salary
Asset (cash) decreases
Asset (cash) increases
Equity decreases
Equity increases
Because of this dual impact of each transaction, the value of each transaction
should be written in two places. This means there should be two entries for each
transaction. However, when the business expands, a large number of transactions
could take place. In such a case, recording those transactions in an accounting
equation may not be practical. Even though we could record those transactions
in the accounting equation, it is very difficult to obtain information clearly whenever
necessary. Therefore, the dual impact of transactions are usually recorded in
accounts according to the double entry system.
6.2 Double entry system
As mentioned above, there is a dual impact of each transaction to the accounting
equation and this dual impact should be recorded in accounts. When recording the
dual impact of a transaction, the same amount has to be recorded in two separate
accounts. Each account has a debit and a credit side. If a value of a transaction
is debited to a particular account, that value also should be credited to another
account. The accounting system, which records the same amount in debit and credit
sides of accounts is called as the double entry system.
6.3 Account
An account is a commonly accepted structure that is used to record the change
(increase or decrease) of an asset, an equity, a liability, an income or an expense for
a time period. An account can be prepared as follows.

(3) and (7) - The ledger folio (page number) of the account that is used to record
the other entry of the transaction.
(4) and (8) - The value of the transaction.
6.4 Types of accounts
We already discussed that assets, equity, liabilities, income and expenses arise due
to business transactions. Accounts are used to record the changes of assets, equity,
liabilities, income and expenses due to transactions. All these accounts can be
classified into five types.
Asset accounts
Examples :- Building account, Debtors account,
Cash account
Liability accounts
Examples :- Bank loan account, Creditors
account, Electricity expense
payable account
Equity accounts
Examples :- Capital account, Drawings account
Income accounts
Examples :- Sales account, Sales commission
income account, Interest income
account
Expenses accounts
Examples :- Salary expense account, Insurance charges
account, Electricity expense account

When recording business transactions in accounts, the value of a transaction should
be either recorded in the debit side or the credit side of the relevant account. Let us
consider how to record such transactions in accounts.
For free distribution
6.5 Recording transactions in accounts
Accounts are debited or credited to show the increase or decrease of assets, equity,
liabilities, income or expenses due to transactions. However, debiting an account
does not always mean an increase. To show an increase, some accounts are debited
and also to show a decrease some accounts are debited. This is same with crediting
an account. This creates a problem. The problem is to decide what is debited or what
is credited to show this changes. There are some generally accepted principles in
accounting which address this problem. These principles are called as the principles
of Double Entry. There are five principles for the five types of accounts. They are
shown in the following table.

The Ledger
A separate account has to be maintained for
each type of asset. Accordingly, there can be
many asset accounts in a business such as
motor vehicle account, furniture account, cash
account, etc. Similarly, there can be many
accounts for each type of equity, liability,
income and expenses in a business. A collection
of all accounts is called as the ledger. Therefore,
recording business transactions in accounts is
also named as recording business transactions
in the ledger.

7.1 Introduction to prime entry books
There may be issues in recording the business transactions in the ledger accounts
directly as they take place' Hence, before the transactions are recorded in ledger
accounts, they should be recorded in a separate set of books known as ''the prime
entry books.''
The prime entry books are the books in which the transactions of a business are
recorded at first, according to the order in which each transaction had occurred by
using a generally accepted method before recording them in the ledger accounts.
Prime entry books are also named as journals, day books, and subsidiary books.
It is not suitable to record all the transactions in a single prime entry book. Hence,
the transactions have to be classified and recorded based on their nature and other
common characteristics. Accordingly, the transactions which are similar in nature
and occur recurrently should be recorded in different prime entry books.
The following table shows various types of transactions and the relevant prime
entry books in which those transactions should be recorded.

7.2 Necessity of prime entry books
The recording of transactions in prime entry books is necessary due to the
following reasons.
Y Similar types of transactions of a period need to be classified and
recorded.
Y Posting transactions to the ledger becomes systematical and convenient
after recording them in the prime entry book.
Y Responsibility of preparing each prime entry book can be assigned
distinctly to various individuals and accordingly, the business could
minimize possible errors and frauds.
Y It is easy to maintain the ledger because the totals of prime entry books
are posted to the ledger, which minimizes the number of entries posted.
Y Minimizes the occurrence of accounting errors and it is easy to find out
such errors.
Information of the transactions is obtained from source documents to record
them in the prime entry books. Therefore, it is important to understand the
relationship between the prime entry books and the source documents.
7.3 The source documents
As and when transactions take place in a business, the documents prepared by
including all the details of such transactions and authorized by a person-in-charge
are known as source documents.
Each source document prepared by a business is assigned a serial number. Source
documents are used as a basis for recording the transactions in the prime entry
books of a business.
Source documents include the following details.
Y Name and address of the business
Y Serial number
Y The date on which the transaction had taken place
Y The details of the other party that is connected to the transaction
Y Description of the transaction
Y The monetary value of the transaction
Y Signature of the officer who is responsible for the transaction

The receipts and payments of cash by the business are recorded in the cash book
using receipts and payment vouchers respectively as source documents.
Receipts
When a business receives cash the business would issue a document called a 'receipt'
to the party who gave money to the business, as evidence for such a receipt.
A serial number in consecutive order is printed on it. Further, this receipt is issued
with the details such as date of cash receipt, the reason why it was received, the
amount received and the signature of the cashier. This is also known as the cash
receipt or cash memo. Receipt is the written evidence of cash received by the
business. A duplicate of the receipt should be received by the accounts branch and
it should be used as a source document to record the receipt of cash in the cash
book. Receipts can be prepared in different formats according to the nature and
requirement of the business. There is no specific format for a receipt. A business
could use a receipt that has a general format as indicated below. Please refer them.

Dual function of the cash book
Cash book functions as a prime entry book as business records the receipts and
payments of cash at first in the cash book in a sequential order using the receipts
and payment vouchers as source documents.
Cash book also functions as a ledger account as it has both the debit and the credit
sides. Therefore, cash book performs two functions.
Y Performs the function as a prime entry book
Y Performs the function as a ledger account
Recording of cash transactions
Cash is an asset of the business. The receipt of cash increases assets and the payment
of cash decreases assets. Therefore, the double entry principle for asset accounts
should be applied for recording cash transactions in the cash book.
Cash received - Cash book debit [the rule, the increase of asset - debited]
Payment of cash - Cash book credit [the rule, the decrease of asset - credited]
Accordingly, all the cash receipts should be debited and all the cash payments
should be credited in the cash book.
Since the cash book functions as a ledger account, when the business receives cash,
the debit entry of the double entry for that transaction entered in the cash book.
Only the credit entry of the relevant account has to be posted in the ledger. Simi-
larly, the payment of cash is credited in the cash book and the credit entry of the
double entry entered in the cash book. Only the debit entry of the relevant account
has to be posted in the ledger.
Accordingly,
Y The values that are debited in the cash book should be credited to the
relevant accounts in the ledger
Y The values that are credited in the cash book should be debited to the
relevant accounts in the ledger

Balancing off the accounts
The value of transactions are debited and credited in the accounts according to
the principle of double entry. At the end of the period, the difference of the total
values of debit and credit entries in accounts should be calculated. This difference
is known as the balance of the account. Balancing off of an account is required to
calculate the balance of that account.
Example :-
The total receipt of cash is Rs. 50 000. The total payment of cash
is Rs. 33 000. Then the balance of cash is Rs. 17 000. This is
considered to be the balance of the cash book.

Discounts
A discount can be explained in brief as the deduction of value from the value of a
transaction (i.e. listed price) when it takes place. Discounts can be classified into
two main categories as trade discounts and cash discounts. Discounts are further
classified as discount received and discount allowed.

Trade Discounts
Figure 8.1 - Discounts
Most businesses sell goods deducting a certain amount from the listed price. The
deduction which was made from the listed price is called as trade discount. This
deduction is a trade discount allowed from the point of view of the seller and a trade
discount received from the buyer's point of view.
The value to be recorded in the sales or the purchase accounts should be the net
value after deducting the trade discount. Therefore, trade discounts are not recorded
in accounts.
Example :-
Listed price of goods
Trade discount to be deducted
According to that,
the value of trade discount: 20 000 x 10
= Rs. 20 000
= 10%
= Rs. 2 000
Net value paid after the trade discount
= Rs. 18 000
This Rs. 18 000 should only be recorded in the accounts.

Cash discounts
Cash discounts come in to being when amounts are received from debtors and
paid to creditors.
There are certain instances where a condition is included in the invoice to encourage
the customers to settle their outstanding balances such that a percentage from
the outstanding balance would be deducted from the amount due if that amount
is paid within a specific period of time set by the business. This amount which is
deducted from the amount due is called a cash discount.
Cash discounts can be classified into two,
Y Discounts allowed
Y Discounts received
Discounts allowed
The deduction made on the amount receivable from the debtors, if such amount
is settled within a time allowed by the business, is called a discount allowed. It is
an expense from the point of view of the business.
Accordingly, since discounts allowed are generated when cash is received from
debtors, it is easy to record the discount allowed in the cash book. A separate
column for discounts allowed is drawn in the debit side of the cash book and
discounts allowed are recorded in it.
For free distribution
Discounts received
Discount received is the amount deducted by the creditors from the amount payable
to them if it is paid by the business within the time allowed by the creditors. It is an
income in the point of view of the business.
Discounts received are created when creditors are paid. Therefore it is easy to record
the discount received in the cash book. Discounts received are recorded in the discount
received column, which is separately drawn in the credit side of the cash book.
These discount columns are considered as memorandum columns. These columns
serve only the purpose of a prime entry book. Since discount columns do not serve the
purpose of a ledger account, mere recording a value in them do not complete even one
entry of the double entry. Therefore the double entries for these items in the discount
columns should be entered in the ledger accounts separately.
Recording of discounts in the accounts
The total of the debit side discount column in the cash book should be debited in
discount allowed account which is opened in the ledger. Debiting of discount allowed
account conforms to the double entry principle on increase of an expense. Credit
entries should be made in each of the debtors accounts. This is done because the
decrease of asset is credited in that account as per the rules of double entry.
Accordingly, the double entry for discount allowed is,
Discount allowed account
Debtors' accounts
The total of credit side discount column in the cash book is credited in the discount
received account opened in the ledger. Discount received is an income and increase
of income is credited according to the double entry rule for income. Debit entries
for these should be made in each of the creditor's account. This is due to decrease
of liability should be debited in the liability account.
Therefore, the double entry for the discount received is as followers.

A business receives cash as well as cheques from the debtors. At the same time
cheques may also be received from cash sales. If the cheques so received are
not banked on the same day then they can be used as currency notes. Therefore,
cheques received should be recorded in the cash book similar to recording of
receipts of cash. There will be discounts allowed when cheques are received from
debtors. These discounts are recorded in the discount allowed column of the cash
book'

8.2 Petty Cash Book
Out of the payments made by a business, some of the payments are of small in
amount and would occur frequently.
Examples :-
Payment of cleaning expenses of Rs. 150
Payment of postal charges of Rs. 60
Accordingly, postal charges. cleaning expenses, travelling expenses, entertainment
expenses and stationery expenses are some examples for the day to day expenses
of small values.
The petty cash book is the prime entry book in which the payments of cash
with small values that occur frequently are recorded. Petty cash book also
functions as a ledger account. Therefore, it also has a dual role like cash book.
The responsibility of maintaining a petty cash book is assigned to a petty cashier,
who is under the main cashier. A voucher has to be prepared for each and every
petty cash payment. It is known as the petty cash voucher. It is the source document
for the payments to be recorded in the petty cash book.
Petty cash imprest
For purpose of carrying the petty cash payments with a control, a specific amount of
cash is given to the petty cashier by the main cashier to make petty cash payments,
which is known as the petty cash imprest. It is the duty of the petty cashier to make
petty cash payments out of this petty cash imprest as well as and to maintain the
petty cash book.
Reimbursement of petty cash imprest
The petty cashier has to request again cash from the main cashier before the petty
cash imprest is over. The petty cashier should be given the amount equivalent to the
amount of payments made at that time and with that the imprest will be reimbursed.
This is known as reimbursement of the petty cash imprest.
Example :-
The petty cash imprest of the business of Lihini was Rs. 2 000. The
following payments were made out of this imprest received.
Stationery expenses
Cleaning expenses
Entertainment expenses
Travelling expenses
Total petty cash expenses
1 600
For free distribution
Accordingly, total petty cash expenses was Rs. 1 600. When the petty cashier
requests again for cash from the main cashier, the main cashier will give the petty
cashier only Rs. 1600, which is the amount spent. This is reimbursement of the
petty cash imprest.
Then,
Petty cash balance in hand
Petty expenses reimbursed
Petty cash imprest

The petty cashier should submit a payment voucher that includes all petty cash
vouchers to date relevant to the petty cash payments to the main cashier for the
reimbursement.
Activity 04
Sarasi Co. Ltd. maintains a petty cash book under a petty cash imprest system for

voucher, total expenses during the month of January was Rs. 1 670.
Answer following questions using the above information.
01. How much is the petty cash imprest ?
02. How much will be the reimbursement made by the main cashier as at
31.01.20xx
03. If the petty cash imprest was decided to be increased by Rs. 500 on
01.02.20xx, then how much will be the value of reimbursement?
04. If the petty cash balance was Rs. 729 as at the 01.03.20xx. Then, how
much should to be reimbursed?

Preparation of petty cash book
Different columns are maintained to record similar types of payments, so that the
payments can be posted to the ledger easily. These columns are known as analysis
columns.
Examples :-
Stamp charges, postal charges, purchases of envelops and other
similar types of expenses could be identified and recorded in
the analysis column named as postal charges.
If any petty cash payments cannot be entered in any of the analysis columns, a
separate column known as the sundry expense column could be drawn for such
payments. Any other expenses, which cannot be included in any of the analysis
columns but need to be separately posted to the relevant ledger accounts are
recorded in the column named as the other ledger account column.
Examples :-
Cash paid to creditors, purchase of assets of small value, carriage inwards.

Like the cash book, the petty cash book also performs a dual function. Accordingly,
both the functions of a prime entry book and a ledger account is fulfilled by the
petty cash book.
For free distribution
As the receipt of petty cash imprest and the payment of
petty cash payments are first recorded in the petty cash
book, it performs the task of a book of prime entry.
Petty cash book also has both debit and credit sides, and
entries are recorded according to the principle of double entry
for assets. Therefore, it performs the function of a ledger account.
Petty cash transactions are recorded based on the following double entries.
When the petty cash imprest is received and the reimbursement is made,
Petty Cash book
Cash book
Debit
Credit
The payments credited in the petty cash book should be debited in the relevant
ledger accounts. The totals of each analysis column should be posted to the relevant
ledger accounts. Accordingly, the double entry is,
Relevant expense account
Petty Cash book
Debit
Credit
The values recorded in the other ledger account column should be separately debited
to the relevant ledger accounts.
When the petty cash book is balanced at the end of a time period, the total of the
debit side is transferred to in the total of the credit column and the difference should
be brought forward as the b/f balance.

9.1 Bank Account
Most businesses like to conduct cash transactions conveniently and securely by
opening a current account. The bank account and the cash book are considered as
asset accounts. Therefore, when the transactions are carried out through the bank
account, they should be recorded according to the double entry principle for assets.
Let us understand how the transactions that are conducted through bank current
account are recorded in a business.
01. Deposit of cash in the bank
A specified amount of cash has to be deposited to open a current account. In addition,
cash received by the business would be deposited in the current account. When a
business deposits cash in the current account, the balance in the current account
increases and the cash balance decreases.
The double entry for deposit of cash is as follows.
Bank account Dr.
Cash book Cr.
When depositing cash, a deposit slip has to be completed and submitted along with
cash to the bank. The bank returns a duplicate of the deposit slip to the business
(depositor) immediately. This document is used as a source document for the
recording of the cash deposit.
02. Deposit of cheques received by the business
Balance in the bank account of the business will increase when cheques are
deposited. As explained earlier, when cheques from debtors and cash sales are
received, they are first debited to the cash book.
When these cheques are deposited to the bank later, the double entry should be as
follows.
Bank account Dr.
Cash book Cr.
For free distribution
However, if the received cheques are deposited to the bank at the time of receipt,
instead of debiting to the cash book, they can be directly debited to the bank account
of the business.
Example :-
The cheque received from the sales amounting to Rs. 10 000 was
deposited to the bank account immediately.
Then the double entry is,
Bank account
Sales account
Dr. 10 000
Cr. 10 000
When received cheques are deposited, a cheque deposit slip should be completed
and submitted to the bank along with the cheques. A duplicate of the deposit slip
is given to the business (depositor) by the bank. This document is used as a source
document when the business records the deposited cheque in the bank account of
the business.
Observe the following cheque deposit slip
Figure 9.1 - A copy of a cheque Deposit Slip
For free distribution
03. Issuing of cheques
Payments can be made to creditors, purchases and expenses by issuing cheques.
When a cheque is issued, it is a common practice to complete the cheque and its
counterfoil, which is the remainder of the cheque leaf in the cheque book.
Observe the following cheque and its counter foil
Figure 9.2 - A copy of a cheque
The details of payments made by cheques are recorded in payment vouchers.
Accordingly, when payments are paid by cheques, the payment voucher is used as
the source document to record such transactions in the bank account of the business.
When payments are made by cheques, the balance in the bank account of the
business decreases.
Accordingly, The relevant double entry is as follows.
Expense account or the relevant payment account Dr.
Bank account
04. Dishonouring of cheques
There are situations where a bank refuses cheques due to cheques being written
disorderly, insufficient balance in the current account, signature on the cheque
is different from the specimen signature, etc. This is known as dishonouring of
cheques.
Accordingly, cheques deposited as well as cheques issued may be dishonoured by
the bank. A cheque return notification is sent by the bank to the business to inform
about dishonoured cheques.
For free distribution
Observe the following copy of the cheque return notification.
Figure 9.3 - A copy of a Cheque Return Notification
For free distribution Dishonouring of Deposited Cheques
When cheques are received from cash sales, debtors, etc. and when those cheques
are deposited in the bank, they are debited to the bank account of the business. This
is because the balance in the bank account is increased. However, when a cheque
is dishonored by the bank, in fact, the bank balance does not increase. Therefore,
when a deposited cheque is dishonored, the debit entry made in the bank account of
the business should be reversed. Here, the value of the dishonored cheque should
be cancelled from the bank account and should be recorded as a receivable from the
party who had given the cheque. Accordingly, the double entry for the dishonoured
deposited cheque should be recorded as follows
Debtors/Relevant account Dr.
Bank account
Example :-
A cheque received from a debtor for Rs. 8 000 and deposited in
the bank had been dishonoured by the bank. The double entry for
recording of this dishonoured cheque is as follows.
Debtor's account
Bank account
Dr. 8 000
Cr. 8 000
Dishonouring of issued cheques
It is already discussed that when cheques are issued, the relevant expense account
or other relevant account should be debited and the bank account should be
credited. When such an issued cheque is dishonoured by the bank, entries that were
originally recorded should be reversed. This is done by a reversal entry to the entry
that was recorded originally when the cheque was issued. Accordingly, when an
issued cheque is dishonoured it should be recorded as follows.
Bank account
Expense account/Relevant other account Cr.
Example :-
A cheque issued by the business to a creditor of Rs. 15 000 was
dishonoured when presented to the bank.
When this information is received, the double entry for this dishonored cheque is
as follows.

Bank overdraft
There are situations where banks allow their customers to issue cheques for more
than the existing balance in their current accounts. This facility is known as a bank
over draft. If the business issues cheques exceeding the existing bank balance, the
total of the credit side of the bank account of the business exceeds the total of the
debit side of the bank account. As a result, a credit balance appears in the bank
account. This credit balance of the bank account is known as bank overdraft, which
is considered as a liability of the business. Accordingly, when cheques are issued
in excess of the existing bank balance and when the bank makes payment on them,
the account holder becomes a debtor to the bank and that debit balance in the bank
is known as the bank overdraft.
Example :-
There was a favourable balance (debit balance) in the bank account
of Samadhi's business of Rs 12 000 as at 01.07.20xx. Following
transactions took place during the month of July.

As shown in the above example, the total of the credit side of the bank account is
Rs. 56 000 and the total of the debit side is Rs. 42 000. There is a deficit of Rs. 14 000 in
the debit side than the credit side. As a result, a credit balance of Rs. 14 000 appears
in the bank account. This is the bank overdraft. This is a liability as the business has
to pay it back to the bank.
Activity 02

9.2 Bank reconciliation statement
You have already studied how the transactions are recorded in the bank account
wich are carried out through the current account of a business. The favorable balance
of the bank account of a business is an asset to the business. Transactions should
be recorded in the bank account according to the double entry principle for assets.
The transactions which increase the balance in the bank account are debited and the
transactions which decrease the bank balance should be credited to the bank account.
Now let us study how transactions are recorded in the books of a commercial bank
which maintains a current account on behalf of a business. The bank also records in
its own books the transactions of the business operated through the current account
by a business. The account that is maintained by the bank of the business is treated
as a liability account of the bank. Therefore, the bank records the transactions of
the business according to the double entry principle for liabilities. Accordingly, the
transactions that increase the bank balance should be credited and the transactions
that decrease the bank balance should be debited.
Accordingly, let us study how a bank has recorded few bank transactions of a
business in its books. See the statement below.

The values which are debited in the bank account that is maintained by the business
are credited by the bank in the account maintained by the bank. The values which
are credited by the business in the bank account are debited by the bank in the
account. Finally, if there is a debit balance in the bank account maintained by the
business, there will be a credit balance in the bank account maintained by the bank
for the business.
For free distribution Bank Statement
Usually, banks send a statement called a bank statement to their current account
holders once a month. The bank statement shows the opening balance, items which
are debited and credited by the bank during the month and the closing balance.
At present, banks send a computer printout to the business that holds a current
account. The statement that is sent by the bank is known as the bank statement or
the statement of accounts.
Examine the following bank statement carefully.
Figure 9.4 - A copy of a bank statement
For free distribution The bank account of the business shows the cash at the bank when balancing off
its bank account. The bank statement sent by the bank shows the money at bank
of the business according to the books of the bank. If both parties had recorded all
transactions related to the current account, these two balances should be similar.
However, in practice, the bank account balance of the business and the balance in the
bank statement may differ. The reason for this difference is that certain transactions
which have been recorded in the bank account are not recorded in the bank statement
and certain other transactions recorded in the bank statement are not recorded in the
bank account of the business.
The reasons for the difference between the final balance of the bank
account and the final balance of the bank statement
01. The cheques issued but not presented to the bank for payment
When a business issues cheques, they are credited to the bank account. Then, the
balance of the bank account maintained by business decreases. There are instances
where some of these cheques issued by the business may have not been presented
to the bank for encashment even at the end of the period. These are known as the
cheques issued but not presented or as unpresented cheques. Since the bank has not
paid for these cheques, they are not recorded as payments in the bank statement.
Therefore, the balance of the bank account of the business should be less
than the balance in the bank statement.
02. The cheques deposited but not realised
When received cheques are deposited in the bank, the bank account of the business
should be debited. Then, the balance in the bank account increases. Some of these
cheques that were deposited may have not been realised by the end of the time period.
Realisation of cheques refers to the process that the amount mentioned in the cheque
has been collected and added to the current account in the bank. It would take few
days for the amount of the cheque to be collected and added to the balance in the
bank current account. Therefore, it is possible that the bank has not recorded the value
of the cheques deposited in the books of the bank even at the end of the relevant
time period. These cheques are identified as the cheques deposited but not realised.
Therefore, cheques deposited but not yet realized are not recorded as deposits in the
bank statement.
Therefore, the balance of the bank account of the business should be higher
than the balance in the bank statement.

03. Direct remittances
There are occasions when some customers deposit their dues directly to the current
account at the bank. Similarly receivables such as rent, interest and dividends, etc.,
are sometimes directly remitted to the current account. These are known as direct
remittances. A business realizes such direct remittances after the receipt of the bank
statement. Although, such direct deposits have been recorded as reciepts in the
bank statement they have not been recorded in the bank account of the business.
Therefore, the bank account balance of the business is less than the balance
in the bank statement.
04. Payments on standing orders
Standing orders refers to an order made to the bank in writing by the business to
pay certain regular amounts such as repayment of instalments of bank loans, leasing
instalments, insurance premiums and other similar payments from the cash in the
current account. The business gets to know of these payments, after recieving the
bank statement. The bank deducts (debits) the value from the current account after
payment of such standing orders. Although the payments on standing orders have
been deducted (debited) in the bank statement, these have not been added (credited)
in the bank account yet.
Therefore, the balance in the bank account of the business is higher than the
balance in the bank statement.
05. Bank charges and the charges on cheque book
The charges that a bank deducts from the current account for the services rendered
by the bank to the current account holder is known as bank charges. The amount
charged for the cheque books issued by a bank to the business is called charges
for cheque books. The business realizes know these charges after the receipt of
the bank statement. These charges have been debited in the bank statement as
payments. They have not been recorded in the bank account of the business by the
end of the time period.
Therefore, the balance of the bank account of the business should be higher
than the balance in the bank statement.
The final balance of the bank account of the business and the final balance in the
bank statement may differ due to the above stated reasons.
The reasons for the difference between these balances can be identified only after
the comparison of the bank account of the business and the bank statement sent by
the bank. Accordingly, the reasons for the difference should be identified first by
comparing the bank account and the bank statement.
For free distribution
For that,
Debit column of the bank account should be compared with the credit column
of the bank statement
Credit column of the bank account should be compared with the debit
column of the bank statement.
Therefore, each value in the bank account should be checked to see whether those
values have been included in the bank statement. The items which have been
recorded in both should be marked. The items remaining unmarked in both the bank
account and the bank statement are the items which have been recorded only in one
of the books. Those unmarked items are the reasons for the difference between the
two final balances. An understanding of this can be obtained through the following
exercise.

The Reasons for this difference are,
01. When the debit side of the bank account and the credit column
of the bank statement are compared,
Cheque deposited but not realised was (Cheque No. 58) Rs. 14 000.
A direct remittance to the current account in the bank by a debtor was
Rs. 11 000.
For free distribution
02. When the credit side of the bank account and the debit side of
the bank statement are compared.
Unpresented cheque to the bank (Cheque No. 114) was Rs. 16 000.
The payment on standing order for bank loan instalment not
recorded in the bank account was Rs. 18 000.
Bank charges not recorded in the bank account was Rs. 3 000.
To adjust and compare these reasons, two steps have to be followed. They are,
01. Adjusting the bank account balance of the business.
02. Preparation of bank reconciliation statement based on the adjusted
bank balance obtained under Step 1 above.
Adjusting the bank account balance of the business
Among the reasons that have caused a difference between the bank account balance
and the current account balance, there may be some errors or omissions in the bank
account of the business.
Due to these errors or ommissions, the bank account balance becomes incorrect.
Therefore, the bank account balance should be adjusted. This is known as adjusting
of the balance of the bank account of the business.
According to the above example, values of the following causes should be adjusted
in the bank account of the business.
01. Direct remittances (Debtors' remittance)
02. Standing order (Bank loan instalment)
03. Bank charges
The bank account balance should increase by the
receipt of the direct remittance. Therefore, the direct
remittance should be debited to the bank account of
the business.
Payment on the standing order and charges made by
the bank should decrease the bank balance. Therefore,
the payment on the standing order and charges should
be credited to the bank account of the business. We get
the adjusted balance of the bank account after these
adjustments.
Based on this example, the bank account of the business is adjusted as follows.

Preparation of the bank reconciliation statement using the adjusted balance of
the bank account
After adjusting the bank account, if the adjusted balance of the bank account is not
similar to the balance of the bank statement, following will be the main reasons for
the difference.
Y The values of the cheques which have been deposited but not realised
Y The values of the cheques which have been issued but not presented to the bank
for payment
However, the above two reasons are not errors or omissions and therefore, the
bank account balance is not adjusted. Therefore, a statement should be prepared
including the above two reasons to reconcile between the balance of the adjusted
bank account and balance of the bank statement. This statement is identified as
the bank reconciliation statement. By the preparation of the bank reconciliation
statement, the accuracy of the balances can be ensured.
Accordingly,
The bank account balance is less than the balance of the bank
statement due to the cheques which have been issued
but not presented to the bank for payment. Therefore, the
cheques which have not been presented to the bank should
be shown as an addition to the adjusted bank balance in the
bank reconciliation statement.
The bank account balance is higher than the balance of
the bank statement due to the cheques which have been
deposited but have not been realised within that period.
Therefore, the cheques deposited but not realised should
be shown as a deduction from the adjusted bank balance in
the bank reconciliation statement.
The balance we get after preparing the bank reconciliation statement including the
above two reasons should be the balance mentioned in the bank statement.
Let us see how the bank reconciliation statement is prepared using the adjusted
bank account balance based on the example given earlier.

Accordingly, if the bank balance of the business at the end of a certain time period
does not agree with the balance in the bank statement, following steps should be
followed to reconcile these balances.
Y See whether there is a difference between the balance of the bank account
and the balance of the bank statement.
Y Identify the reasons for the difference, comparing the bank account and

Y Adjusting the final balance of the bank account.
Y Preparation of the bank reconciliation statement using the adjusted bank

10.1 Purchases Journal
Businesses purchase goods with the objective of reselling. These goods are pur-
chased either on cash basis or on credit basis. Goods purchased on credit basis are
recorded in a separate record named as the Purchases Journal. This is also known
as the Purchases Day Book.
The purchases of trade goods on credit basis are initially recorded in the Purchase Journal.
Example :-
If a business buys and resells stationeries ,the purchase of stationeries
on the credit basis is recorded in the Purchases Journal.
If a business buys and resells automobiles, the purchase of auto
mobiles on credit basis is recorded in the Purchase Journal.
When purchasing goods on credit basis, the parties providing goods are known
as suppliers or trade creditors. The amount payable to creditors are liabilities of
a business. Suppliers, when providing goods on credit, prepare and send a source
document including information about supply. This source document is the ‘invoice’.
In the perspective of the purchasing business, it is the purchase invoice. The
information in the purchase invoice is required to be recorded in the Purchases
Journal at first. Thereafter, those transactions are posted into the ledger later.

The condition ‘5/30 net 60’ indicates that the purchaser should settle the credit
within 60 days and if he/she settles within 30 days, a 5% cash discount will be
given.
The trade discount is the reduction in the listed price of a good at the time of
purchasing on credit. This trade discount is deducted in the invoice and not
recorded in accounts. After deducting the trade discount the net purchase value of
an invoice will be recorded in the Purchase Journal.

10.2 Sales Journal
When a business sells trading goods on credit, such transactions are first recorded
in the Sales Journal.
When selling trading goods on credit, an invoice is issued to debtors. This document
is known as the sales invoice. The business retains a copy of the sales invoice. This
sales invoice is the source document for recording transactions in the Sales Journal.
The price mentioned in the invoice may also be reduced by a certain percentage
when selling on a credit basis. This reduction is the trade discount. The net value
after deducting this trade discount is recorded in the Sales Journal.
The transactions recorded in the Sales Journal are posted into the ledger periodically.
Example :-
The following invoices with net values are issued by
Amarasinghe’s Business which buys and sells consumer goods.

11.4 Preparation of the trial balance
For free distribution
11.1 Introduction to trial balance
When preparing ledger accounts based on the double entry principles, the value
of a transaction is recorded in the debit side of one account and in the credit side
of the other relevant account. As a result of this, after balancing off the ledger
accounts, there are debit and credit balances. If the transactions are recorded and
ledger accounts are balanced correctly the totals of debit and credit balances should
be equal. The list which is prepared at the end of the period by including all the
debit and credit balances of ledger accounts is called as the trial balance. The trial
balance is not an account. It is merely a list of balances and could be considered as
a summary of the ledger.
If the debit and credit entries have been recorded correctly in ledger accounts and
those accounts have been balanced correctly, the total of the debit column of the
trial balance should agree with the total of the credit column of the trial balance.
If the trial balance agrees, following two facts can be confirmed.
1. The values debited to the accounts are equal to the values credited to the accounts
2. Ledger accounts have been balanced correctly (i.e. there is mathematical accuracy).

For free distribution
12.1 The need to correct accounting errors
Accounting is expected to provide accurate information to stakeholders in making
decisions. However, errors may occur when business transactions are recorded in
prime entry books, posted to the ledger, balancing the ledger accounts as well as
when extracting accounting balances for the trial balance. If such errors had occurred
in the accounting process, correct information cannot be provided to the stakeholders
to make decisions. Therefore, such errors should be corrected before the financial
statements are prepared.
12.2 The occasions when accounting errors may occur
The occasions when accounting errors may occur is stated below.
01. When transactions are recorded in the prime entry books
Errors may occur when recording transactions in prime entry books.
Examples :-
A sales invoice of Rs. 20 000 of credit sales has not been recorded in
the sales journal.
A purchase invoice of Rs. 50 000 has been entered erroneously as
Rs. 5 000 in the purchases journal.
02. When the transactions are posted to the ledger from the prime
entry books
Errors may occur when transactions are posted to the ledger accounts.
Examples :-
The total of the purchases journal that amounts to Rs. 50 000 has
not been posted to the purchases account.
The total of the sales journal that amounts to Rs. 155 000 has been
entered erroneously as Rs. 150 000 in the sales account.
03. When balancing of ledger accounts
Errors may arise when balancing ledger accounts at the end of the period.
Examples :-
Total of the sales account has been totalled less by Rs. 10 000
Total of the rent account is overstated by Rs. 5 000
For free distribution
04. When the trial balance is prepared
Errors may occur in the preparation of the trial balance using the balances of the
ledger accounts.
Examples :-
The balance of the electricity bill account of Rs. 15 000 has not
been extracted to the trial balance.
The balance of the insurance account of Rs. 10 000 has been
entered as Rs. 1 000 in the trial balance.
Errors may occur in this way at different stages in the accounting process. There-
fore, as the first step, a business should identify such errors.
12.3 Identification of accounting errors
Transactions of a business are recorded according to the double entry principle.
Accordingly, every debit entry should have a corresponding credit entry. As a result,
the total of the debit column should be equal to the total of the credit column of the
trial balance prepared by the business.
If both the totals are not equal, it is an indication that errors have occurred in the
accounting process. However, even if the totals agree, still there might be errors.
Hence, the agreement of credit and debit balances in the trial balance only
confirms that similar value of debits have been recorded as credits and the accounts
are balanced.
Accordingly, accounting errors can be categorized in to two.
Y Errors that do not affect the agreement of the trial balance
Y Errors that affect the agreement of the trial balance
Accordingly, errors should be corrected using the general journal. Thereafter, the
erroneous ledger accounts need to be corrected.
Now, let us study how each of the errors mentioned above is corrected.
For free distribution
12.4 Errors that do not affect the agreement of trial balance
Some errors that occur in the accounting process might not affect the agreement of
the trial balance. Therefore, even if such errors had occurred, the total of the debit
column would be equal to the total of the credit column of the trial balance. These
errors are also known as "the errors that are not revealed by the trial balance."
Examples for such errors are stated below.
01. A complete ommission of a transaction from the books
If a particular transaction is not recorded in the prime entry book, such a transaction
would not be entered in the ledger accounts as well. These errors are known as
"errors of omission." The double entry of the omitted transaction should be entered
properly in the relevant ledger accounts to correct this error.
Example :-
An invoice of credit purchase Rs. 50 000 has been completely
omitted from the accounting books.
The above error is corrected as,

02. Recording incorrect value of a transaction in the prime entry
books
This refers to recording lesser or higher than the correct value of the transaction
in the prime entry books. Then, both the values entered as debit and credit entries
have the erroneous value. However, there is no impact on the agreement of the
trial balance because both the values recorded as debits and credits are the same.
Therefore, recording the difference between the correct and incorrect value that
was recorded is sufficient to correct the error.
For free distribution
Example :-
A credit sales invoice of Rs. 20 000 has been recorded as Rs. 2 000
in error in the sales journal.
Here, both the debtor's account and the sales account have been understated by
Rs. 18 000 (Rs. 20 000 - Rs. 2 000) and therefore, both accounts should be corrected
by recording Rs. 18 000. The journal entry to correct this error is as follows.

as Rs. 1 300 in the discount received column of the cash book.
Here, both creditors and the discount received accounts have been recorded less

03. Recording same transaction twice in the accounting books
Sometimes, a transaction might have been recorded twice in the prime entry books, and
accordingly, posted to ledger accounts twice. This error can be corrected by reversing
the additional entry with the value of the transaction in both of the relevant accounts.
Example :-
Purchase invoice of Rs. 10 000 on credit has been entered twice in
the books.

04. Recording the value of a transaction in an incorrect account instead
of the relevant account
There are occasions when the value of a transaction is recorded in an incorrect
account instead of the relevant account. However, there is no impact on the agreement
of the trial balance due to this error, as the same value had been recorded as both
debit and credit entries.
Example :-
Office equipments that had been purchased for the business use for
Rs. 200 000 is debited in the purchases account.
The purchases account shows the value of the goods bought for the purpose of resale
by the business. Here, the office equipment were purchased only for the business use,
and therefore, it should be debited to the asset account known as the office equipment
account.

Activity 01
An apprentice bookkeeper has prepared a trial balance on 31-12-20xx and says
that it is not necessary to check again the accounts as both the balances of debit
and credit columns of the trial balance agree, as well as the final accounts can be
prepared correctly.
Comment on the above statement.
Activity 02
Even though the totals of the trial balance prepared by a business as at 31-12-20xx
agree, the following errors were identified subsequently.
i. A purchase invoice of Rs. 20 000 has been completely omitted from the
books of accounts.
ii. A computer bought for office use to the cost of Rs. 40 000 has been
debited to the purchases account.
iii.Payment of electricity charges of Rs. 5 000 has been erroneously
debited to the Insurance charges account.
iv. Withdrawals of goods worth of Rs. 12 000 by the owner for his own
use has not been recorded in the books.
Required:
Write the necessary journal entries to correct of the above errors.
12.5 Accounting errors that affect the agreement of the
trial balance
A difference would arise between the total of debit and credit columns of a trial
balance due to certain errors that had occurred in the process of accounting. These
errors are known as the errors which affect the agreement of the trial balance. The
ledger accounts should be checked to identify what such errors are. However, it
would take a considerable amount of time to detect such errors. Therefore, such a
difference should be posted to a suspense account until those errors are identified
and corrected.
For free distribution
Suspense account
When there is a difference between the totals of debit and credit balances in the trial
balance, that difference should be recorded temporarily into an account called the
Suspense account until such errors are identified and corrected.
A suspense account is created in the following way.
i. Identify the difference between the totals of the debit and credit balances
of the trial balance.
ii. Insert that difference on the side where the deficit exists in the trial
balance and balance the trial balance.
iii. As the reason for this shortage is not known yet write the words
"Suspense account" in front of the difference in the trial balance.
iv. Then, record the value of the shortage in a separate Suspense account.
Accordingly, if a difference exists on the credit column of the trial balance, record
such difference on the credit side of the suspense account. On the other hand, if the
difference exists on the debit column of the trial balance insert such difference on
the debit side of the suspense account.
The trial balance as at 31st of December 20xx of Janaka's business is given below.
It has been balanced temporarily by writing Suspense account in front of the
difference of the trial balance.

Find the value of the difference and record it in a suspense account.
Correction of accounting errors that affect the agreement of trial
balance
The reason or reasons for the difference in the trial balance should be identified
after recording the difference in a suspense account. Therefore, certain entries have
to be made in the suspense account to correct the errors. The suspense account will
be eliminated from the books of accounts after the correction of all accounting errors
that affect the agreement of the trial balance. Therefore, when such errors are
corrected one of the double entries for the correction should be entered in the
suspense account.
Let us now consider the errors that are revealed by the trial balance and how such
errors are corrected.
01. Omission of one entry from books
Example :-
Payment of telephone charges of Rs. 15 000 has been recorded
only in the cash book.
For free distribution
Here, the relevant value is not debited to the telephone
charges account. Therefore, the telephone charges
account should be debited to correct this error. On the
other hand, the cash book is already credited correctly.
The total of the debit column of the trial balance is
less by Rs. 15 000 due to this error. As a result, a debit
balance of Rs. 15 000 appears in the suspense
account. Accordingly, the relevant general journal
entry to correct this error is shown below, credit entry
of Rs. 15 000 should be made to correct this in the
suspense account.

02. Making one of the double entries with the correct value and the other
entry with the incorrect value of a transaction.
Example :-
Cash sales for Rs. 54 000 has been debited in the cash book correctly
and has been credited incorrectly as Rs. 45 000 in the sales account.
Here, the sales account has been credited less of Rs. 9 000.
Due to crediting Rs. 9 000 less in the sales account, the
total of credit column of the trial balance is Rs. 9 000
less and a balance of Rs. 9 000 would appear in the
credit side of the suspense account. To correct the error,
the suspense account should be debited with Rs. 9 000
and the sales account should be credited Rs. 9 000. By
doing this, the suspense account will be removed.

03. Recording of the double entries of a transaction in the same side of
the accounts
Both the entries of a transaction may have been entered in the same side of the
accounts in error.
Example :-
Cash received from the debtors of Rs. 5 000 has been debited to both
the cash book and the debtor's account.
Due to the above error, each account has been debited
by Rs. 5 000. No account has been credited. Therefore,
the total of the credit column of the trial balance is
understated by Rs. 10 000. Therefore, the suspense
account has a credit balance of Rs. 10 000. Accordingly,
Rs. 10 000 should be debited to cancel the suspense
account. Rs. 5 000 should be credited to the debtor's
account to cancel the amount debited incorrectly. In
addition, Rs. 5 000 should be credited to the debtor's
account to correct the error. Accordingly, the debtors
account should be credited a total of Rs. 10 000 to
correct the error. The general journal entry is shown
below.

04. Errors which arise when balancing off the accounts
Example :-
The correct total of the purchases account of Rs. 25 000 has been
erroneously totalled posted as Rs. 5 000 in the purchases account.
The total of the debit column of the trial balance is
Rs. 20 000 less due to the shortage of Rs. 20 000 in
the purchase account. Therefore, the suspense
account has a debit balance of Rs. 20 000. Rs. 20 000
should be credited to the suspense account to cancel
this balance. The purchase account should be debited
by Rs. 20 000 to correct the purchase account as it is
understated by Rs. 20 000.

05. Errors that arise when preparing the trial balance
Although all ledger accounts are correct, there is the possibility of errors to occur
when preparing the trial balance.
Following errors may occur when preparing the trial balance,
Y Certain accounts balances have not been extracted to the trial balance
Y Entering incorrect values of account balances in the trial balance
Y Entering value of account balances to the incorrect column of the trial balance
Errors that occur when the trial balance is prepared have a special feature in correc-
tion when compared with other errors. Here, no error has occurred in the relevant
ledger accounts. The errors had occurred only in the trial balance. Therefore, correction
of ledger accounts is not required. Nevertheless, the difference in the totals of the
trial balance have to be recorded in the suspense account.

Example :-
The balance in the building rent expense account of Rs. 10 000 has
not been extracted to the trial balance.
Here, as there is no impact on the building rent
expense account, it is not necessary to correct it.
However, the suspense account has a debit balance
due to the debit column of the trial balance being
understated by Rs. 10 000. Therefore, the error of
understatement can be cancelled by crediting Rs.
10 000 to the suspense account and entering the
building rent expense account to the trial balance.

The following accounting errors have been identified,
01. The balance of the electricity bill account of Rs. 16 000 has not been extracted
to the trial balance.
02. The balance of the interest income account of Rs. 10 000 has been entered in
the debit column of the trial balance.
03. Repayment of bank loan of Rs. 30 000 has been recorded only in the cash book.
04. The balance of the purchases account of Rs. 130 000 has been entered in the
trial balance as Rs. 150 000 in error.
05. The drawings account has been balanced erroneously as Rs. 34 000, instead of
the correct value of Rs. 43 000.
The correction of above errors of Kasuni's business can be explained as follows.
01. The total of debit column of the trial balance has been understated by Rs. 16 000
due to not entering the balance of the electricity bill account. Therefore,
Rs. 16 000 should be included in the debit column of the trial balance and
credited to the suspense account.
For free distribution
02. Interest income account is an income account and should be shown on the
credit column of the trial balance. Therefore, the credit column total of the
trial balance is in short of Rs. 20 000 because of entering the interest income
account balance of Rs. 10 000 in the debt column of the trial balance. Accordingly,
Rs. 20 000 should be entered in the credit column of the trial balance and the
suspense account should be debited with this value.
03. When the part of the bank loan is repaid, the bank loan account should be debited.
However, the bank loan account is not debited with repayment of Rs. 30 000.
Accordingly, the bank loan account is overstated by Rs. 30 000. Further, as a
result, the credit column of the trial balance is overstated by Rs. 30 000 and is
therefore included in the suspense account. Therefore, to correct this error,
the bank loan account should be debited and the suspense account should be
credited with Rs. 30 000.
04. The total of the debit column of the trial balance is overstated by Rs. 20 000
due to entering the purchase account balance as Rs. 150 000 instead of the
correct value of Rs. 130 000. This error has to be corrected.
05. The total of the debit column of the trial balance has been understated by
Rs. 9 000 due to the understatement in the drawings account by Rs. 9 000.
Therefore, Rs. 9 000 should be credited to the suspense account and debited
to the drawings account.
