13.1 Classification of organisms
It is believed that life originated on earth about 3.6 billion years ago. It is accepted
that the life originated as unicellular organisms and thereafter complex multicellular
organisms were evolved gradually. Today about 8.7 million species are living on
earth. There is a great diversity among these organisms. Once these organisms are
grouped, it is easy to study them and to use them for different purposes.
In figure 13.1 fifteen species of organisms are given. Let's do activity 13.1 to group
these organisms.
Activity 13.1
y Identify the species of organisms in Fig. 13.1
y Group the organisms using appropriate criteria
y Compare your grouping with other students in the class

You may have grouped the above organisms on the basis of different criteria.
Grouping of organisms into different levels based on their common
characteristics is known as classification.
• Significance of classification of organisms
There are various uses of classification of organisms. Let us examine as to what
they are,
² Easy to study about organisms
² Ability to identify specific distinguishable characteristics of a given organism
² Ability to get an idea about the whole biosphere by studying about few selected
organisms, without studying each and every organism
Identification of organisms with economical uses to human
² Ability to reveal the relationship between different groups of organisms
²
Methods of classification of organisms
Aristotle in 4th B.C. introduced the first scientific classification of organisms.
Carolus Linnaeus in 18th A.D. introduced a successful classification. All organisms
on earth including human is classified into two methods. They are,
y Artificial classification
y Natural classification
Artificial classification
In artificial classification, features such as the presence or absence of locomotive
appendages of organisms and habitats etc are considered. It does not depict the
evolutionary relationships among organisms. Examples for artificial classification
are as follows.
Plants can be grouped as ornamental plants, herbal plants and poisonous plants.
Animals can be grouped as animals with wings and without wings.
There are many weaknesses in artificial classification.
Under the criteria of presence of wings in the above example birds and insects both
are included into a single group. But they belong to two groups when considering
evolutionary relationships.
Natural classification
A natural classification depicts the evolutionary relationships among living
organisms. In natural classification, morphological, physiological. cytological and
molecular biological features of organisms are considered. The natural classification
possesses below features.
² Explains the natural relationships among organisms of the same species
² Explains the evolutionary relationships among different organisms
E.g. Locomotive appendages - Fins of fish, Feathers of birds, Legs of human
In a natural classification, organisms are grouped into taxonomic levels in a
hierarchy of categories.

Three Domain system of classification
The most appropriate system to classify organisms is the natural classification.
Different scientists have introduced different classification methods from past. One
of them is the five kingdom classification system introduced by Robert Whittaker in
1969. Modern classification is the classification introduced by Carl Woese in 1990
with three domains. The 3 domains are,

The organisms belong to this domain are prokaryotes (without an organized
nucleus). They have the ability to live in extreme environmental conditions like,
volcanoes, deserts, hot springs, ocean beds, high saline environments and polar ice
caps. They are not sensitive to most antibiotics.That is they cannot be destroyed
with antibiotics.

Domain Bacteria
The organisms belong to this domain are also prokaryotes. (without an organized
nucleus) They are sensitive to antibiotics and sometimes are pathogenic. They can
be found every where in the environment. They are the most abundant group of
organisms. Bacteria and Cyanobacteria belong to this domain.

13.2 Nomenclature of organisms
In each language, an object is named using words. Different names are used to
identify organisms. But these names vary according to the language, country and
region. The evolutionary relationships are not depicted in those names. Therefore
scientists wanted to avoid this situation and to name them using a common name.

Binomial nomenclature
A successful nomenclature was introduced by a Swedish natural scientist called
Carolus Linnaeus in 1753. As it contains two epithets for an organism, it is known
as binomial nomenclature.
The methodology to name an organism is regulated by International Commission
on Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN) and International Commission on Zoological
Nomenclature (ICZN).
The standards of binomial nomenclature
y
y The scientific name of a species or species name is composed of two epithets.
y The first epithet is generic name and the second epithet is the specific epithet.
y The species name is given in Latin or Greek.
y The first letter of generic epithet is capital and the other letters are simple.
y When hand written it should be underlined and when printed it should be
italicized.

Continuity of life 14
Biology
14.1 Reproduction
The life process that gives rise to a new generation from an existing generation is
referred to as reproduction. Reproduction is a characteristic feature of organisms. It
is essential to maintain the continuity of life. Reproduction is of two types,
²
²
Asexual Reproduction
Sexual Reproduction
² Asexual reproduction
Reproduction that occurs by spores or vegetative parts from a matured organism is
known as asexual reproduction.
² Sexual reproduction
Reproduction that occurs due to fusion of two gametes produced in sexual structures
of male and female organisms is known as sexual reproduction. Structures that are
adapted for sexual reproduction can be found in evolutionary advanced organisms.
In plants, the structure that is specially formed for sexual reproduction is flower.
In animals, there are male and female reproductive systems.
Differences between sexual reproduction and asexual reproduction are given in the
table below.
Table 14.1- Differences between sexual and asexual reproduction
Asexual reproduction
² Contributes only one parental
organism
Sexual reproduction
² Contribute two organisms which
are referred to as maternal and
paternal
² Gives rise to offsprings which are
² Gives rise to offsprings with
more or less like maternal organism

² Bulbils
Special reproductive structure formed by a modification of a vegetative bud or a
flower bud is known as a bulbil.
E.g. :- Pine apple, Jute, Hondala
² Underground Stems
Stems of plants which grow under the soil are known as underground stems.
Vegetative propagation, storage of food and spending dormant period in adverse
climatic conditions are some functions of underground stems. Underground stems
are categorized into four types according to the external features.
They are;
(I)
(II)
Rhizome - E.g. :- Ginger, Turmeric, Cannas, Araththa
Corm - E.g. :- Big rooted Taro yam(Habarala/Nersshembu), Cocoyam

Activity 14.1
² Observe the plants in your home garden or in school and identify that are
propagated by vegetative parts.
² Tabulate those plants and their methods of propagation.
Artificial vegetative propagation
Production of plants vegetatively by man is known as artificial vegetative
propagation. This can be done in several ways.
² Rooting of stem cuttings
² Layering
² Grafting
² Tissue culture
29
For free distribution
Rooting of stem cuttings
New plants can be obtained by planting stem cuttings of a mother plant. It is more
appropriate to select twigs from a healthy plant that do not bear tender leaves,
flowers or fruits at that time. This method is widely used for some plants like Rose,
Shoe flowers, Ixora, Bougainvillea and Croton.
Assignment 14.1
² Find out and record various agro-chemicals in the market that are used to
promote rooting of twigs.
² Prepare a list of plants that cannot be propagated by stem cuttings.
²
Investigate the features of a twig that should be selected for quick rooting.
Layering
Initiate rooting while it is still attached to the mother plant is known as layering.
Layering is of two types.
1. Ground layering
2. Aerial layering
² Ground Layering
Rooting is initiated from a branch of the plant closer to the ground level by this
method. First a small cut is made on the underside of the selected twig. Then the
twig is bent and burried under the soil. After few weeks, the twig will develop
roots. Then the twig is separated from the mother plant and is planted.
e.g. :- Jasmin, Lemon
² Aerial Layering
This method is used for the twigs which are high above the ground. A ring of bark
of the twig is removed. A mixture of compost and coir dust is placed round that
place and tied with a strip of polythene. After few weeks the twig will develop
roots. Then the twig is separated from mother plant and is planted.
e.g. :- Pomegranate, Lemon
Ground layering
Aerial layering

Following are some advantages of layering.
² Plants that do not produce seeds can be propagated successfully.
² Several number of plants can be produced easily.
Activity 14.2
Identify a plant in your home garden, which is suitable for ground layering.
Follow the process of ground layering properly. After about two weeks, uproot
twig and observe how roots are developed.
Grafting (twig or bud)
Connecting a twig or a bud of a plant to a plant of same or closely related species is
known as grafting. Two parts of the plants grafted are mentioned below.
^1& Stock
The rooted part of the plant is known as stock. Following are the characteristics that
should be shown by a stock.
”
”
”
^2& Scion
Bearing a strong root system.
Having a uniform growth.
Withstanding environmental changes and diseases.
The twig or the bud taken from another plant and grafted to a stock is known as
scion. Following are the characteristics that should be shown by a scion.
” Should be a variety of good characteristics
”
Should be free from pests and diseases
In the process of grafting, stock and scion are fused together by their cambium.
Therefore grafting can be done only on the dicotyledonous plants, which have
cambium tissues. Grafting can be done in two ways as follows.
1' Bud grafting
2' Twig grafting
² Bud grafting
Selecting a plant bud as the scion and grafting it to a stock is known as bud grafting
It is done as follows.
² Cutting a live bud (which is located above the leaf scar) using a
grafting knife.
² Making a cut on the stock and insert the bud into the cut.
² Wrapping the place from bottom to top using polythene strips.
² After few days, when the bud is about to emerge, remove the wrap and
re-wrap keeping the bud open.
² Cutting the stem of the stock about 15 cm above, from the bud after
about three weeks.

Figure 14.3 – Steps of bud grafting
There are several types of bud grafting according to the shape of the cut on the
stock.
E.g. :- T-bud H-bud V-bud
² Twig grafting
In this method, a twig of a plant is taken as the scion. Procedure of grafting is given
below.
² Selecting a twig of a fruit-bearing plant (It is more suitable to select a
twig which has no tender leaves, flowers or fruits).
² Cutting the twig without damaging the cut.
² Fixing the twig to the stock, so that the cambium are contacted.
² Wrapping the place from bottom to top using polythene strips.
² Removing the wrap when the twig is observed to be growing.

According to the shapes of the cuts of the edges of stock and scion several types of
twig grafting can be done.
E.g. :- Arch grafting, Peg grafting
Activity 14.3
Try to perform a twig grafting or a bud grafting with the assistance of your
teacher. If a grafting knife is not available for this, use any other sharp knife.
Following are some advantages of grafting and budding.
” Production of offsprings with characteristics of the scion
” Obtaining of disease resistant plants with strong root systems
” Propagation of plants that do not produce seeds successfully
Disadvantages
” Having a short life span
” Not successful with every plant
” Reduce wood value of the trees
Tissue culture
New offsprings, which are identical to the parental plant, can be produced by
cultivating any vegetative tissue of a plant in a culture medium under controlled
conditions. Offsprings thus obtained are called a clone.
Genetically identical clones can be obtained by tissue culture. Generally, tissues are
taken from apical buds, lateral buds or root tips for this purpose.
Sucrose, mineral salts, vitamins and plant growth substances are included in
the culture medium used for tissue culture. Agar is used to solidify the medium.
Sterilized conditions and controlling of temperature and light should be practised
for the success of tissue culture.
Following are the principle steps followed in tissue culture
^1& Introducing the part of vegetative tissue, obtained from mother plant,
into the culture medium.
^2& Allowing new roots and buds to be developed from the tissue called
callus, which is grown from the vegetative tissue introduced.
^3& Separating the plantlets and placing them in test tubes or flasks to grow
further.
^4& Gradually let the new plantlets to get adapted to natural conditions to be
cultivated in the field.

Sexual reproduction of plants
²
Seeds are produced by fusion of gametes produced in sexual structures in matured
plants. These seeds can grow into new plants.
Flower
The structure that bears sexual parts of a plant is the flower. Parts of a flower are
arranged in whorls on the receptacle, which is located at the tip of the flower stalk
or pedicel. There are four principle parts of a flower, which are given below.

Calyx
Calyx is comprised of several sepals. This is the outer-most part of a flower. Calyx
is the whorl of sepals located on the receptacle at the tip of the flower stalk (pedicel).
This is green in colour. This protects the flower parts, when the flower is in bud
stage.
35
For free distribution
Corolla
Corolla is comprised of a whorl of petals, and is located inner to the calyx. This
is white or colourful. Corolla protects the inner flower parts in the bud stage and
attracts insects for pollination, when the flower blooms.
Androecium/Stamen
Androecium is the male reproductive structure of a flower. This is comprised of a
filament and an anther. There are pollen sacs in the anther which contain pollen.
When matured anther bursts and pollen release. Pollen are the male gamete cells
of plants.
Gynoecium/Pistil
Gynoecium is the female reproductive structure of a flower. This is comprised of
three parts, named stigma, style and ovary. Ovules are located in the ovary. Ovules
are the female gamete cells of a flower.
Activity 14.4
• Collect some flowers. Observe and identify their parts using a hand lens.
•
Invert a shoe flower and cut longitudinally across the stalk and draw a
labelled diagram.
² Bisexual flowers
Flowers that consist of both male and female parts are referred to as bisexual
flowers.
E.g.: Shoe flower, Passionfruit, Chilli, Kathurumurunga /Agathi
² Unisexual flowers
Flowers that consist of either male or female parts are referred to as unisexual
flowers. They are of two types.
^1& Staminate flowers :- The flowers that have only androecium or stamen.
E.g. :- Sterile flowers of Pumpkin, apical flowers of Corn
^2& Pistilate flowers :- The flowers that have only gynoecium or pistil.
E.g. :- Fruit bearing flowers of Pumpkin, fruit bearing flowers of Corn
² Monoecious plants
Plants that bear both staminate (male) flowers and pistilate (female) flowers are
called monoecious plants.
E.g. :- Pumpkin, Corn, Coconut, Bitter gourd
² Dioecious plants
When staminate flowers and pistilate flowers are born separately on two plants,
they are called dioecious plants.
E.g. :- Papaw, Vallisneria

Pollination
The process of depositing matured pollen of a flower on the stigma of the flower of
the same species is known as pollination. Pollination occurs in two ways.
^1& Self-pollination
^2& Cross-pollination
Self-pollination
The process of depositing matured
pollen of a flower on the stigma of
the same flower is termed as self-
pollination.
Cross - pollination

Agents of pollination
Factors that contribute the pollination of flowers are known as agents of pollination.
There are three principle agents of pollination.
1.Animals
2.Wind
3.Water
Animals
Flowers pollinated by animals are referred to as zoophilous flowers. Among the
animals, insects contribute much for pollination. Flowers have adaptations to attract
insects for the process of pollintation.
” Flowers having a fragrance
” Flowers being large
” Colourful flowers
” Having nectaries
” Pollen being sticky
” Stigma being sticky
” Stamens and stigma are located in such a way, that they are easily contacted
with animals

Wind
Flowers pollinated by wind are referred to as aerophilous or anemophilous
flowers. Such flowers usually locate separately as staminate and pistilate flowers.
Aerophilous flowers show following adaptations for successful pollination.
♦ Flowers are born at the apex of the plant
♦ Large amount of pollen are produced
♦ Pollen are very small and light
♦ Stigma is branched
♦ Flowers are in inflorescences
Examples for flowers pollinated by wind are Paddy, Corn, Grass and Coconut

Flowers pollinated by water are referred to as hydrophilous flowers. Such flowers
usually locate separately as staminate and pistilate flowers. When matured, staminate
flower separates from the plant and floats in water. While floating it contacts with
a pistillate flower and pollination takes place. Example for a flower pollinated by
water is Vallisneria.

• Pollen are deposited on stigma of the same flower or in another flower of the
same species.
• When a pollen grain is deposited on the stigma, it is stimulated by the sugar
solution on the stigma and germinates.
• Pollen tube grows through the style towards an ovule in the ovary.
• The male gamete in the pollen cell fuses with the ovum in the ovary and this
phenomenon is known as fertilization.
41
For free distribution
Production of fruits and seeds
After fertilization zygote develops to form an embryo. The flower undergoes several
changes after fertilization.
• Ovary develops to form the fruit.
• Wall of the ovary becomes the pericarp.
• Fertilized ovule develops to a seed, and wall of the ovule becomes the testa
or the seed coat.
• Normally sepals, petals, stamens and stigma are worn out. But in some
flowers, sepals become fleshy and are attached to the pericarp after
fertilization.
E.g. :- Guava, Brinjal, Mangosteen, Rose apple
Process of developing fruits without fertilization is known as parthenocarpy.
Artificial growth substances are used to develop fruits in that manner. Such fruits
are seedless.
E.g. :- Grapes, Orange, Apple
Dispersal of fruits & seeds
Spreading away of the fruits and seeds from the mother plant is referred to as
dispersal of fruits and seeds. Plants fulfil their following requirements by that
process.
• Competition for essential requirements is minimized
• New habitats are found
• Diversity is increased
• Protection from pests and agents of diseases
Methods of dispersal of fruits and seeds
There are four principle methods of dispersal of fruits and seeds, as mentioned
below.
• By animals
• By water
• By wind
• By explosive mechanism

Germination of seeds
Activation of the embryo in a seed and its development to form a seedling is known
as seed germination. Following factors are essential for seed germination.
1) Viability of seed
2) Air (Oxygen)
3) Water or moisture
4) Optimum temperature
When a seed is germinating, water activates the enzymes in the cotyledons, and
stored complex food is digested to simple nutrients. The nutrients help to develop
the radical and the plumule.
Dormancy of seeds
Sometimes seeds do not germinate, though the essential factors for germination
are fulfilled. This condition is known as dormancy.
Seeds show dormancy as an adaptation for adverse environmental conditions.
Following factors affect the dormancy of seeds.
1) Embryo being not matured
2)
Impermeability of testa for water or oxygen
Various methods are practised to remove the dormancy of seeds before germinating
them. Some of them are mentioned below.
1) Storing seeds for some period of time
2) Burning the villi on the seed coat or testa E.g. - Teak seeds
3) Removing the seed coat E.g. - Orange seeds
4) Keeping the seeds in hot water E.g. - Lead tree (Ipil Ipil)
5) Gently cracking the seed coat E.g. - Nelli/Nellikai seeds

Puberty (Adolescence)
Sexual maturity or attaining adolescence is referred to as puberty. Secondary sexual
characteristcs which differentiate males and females begin to appear from the
puberty
² Secondary sexual characteristics
Features that appear in male and female from puberty are known as secondary
sexual characteristics.
Secondary sexual characteristics of males
These changes start to appear between the age of 13-16 years. The action of
Testosterone hormone is responsible for this.
• Pubertal hair grows on face, chest, under arm pits and in genital areas.
• Shoulders grow wide.
• Larynx enlarges and voice becomes deep.
• Bones and muscles grow faster and the growth of body is accelerated.
• Testes start to produce sperms.
• Genitals start to grow larger.
Secondary sexual characteristics of female
These changes start to appear between the age of 10-14 years. The action of
Oestrogen and Progesterone are responsible for this.
• Pubertal hair grows on arm-pits and on genital areas.
• Pubic region widens.
• Mammary glands start to grow.
• Fat deposits in the hypodermis and body becomes fat.
• Bones and muscles grow fast and the growth of body is accelerated.
• Releasing of ova from ovaries (menstrual cycle) starts.

testes sac. Sperms are produced in these structures. A testes is comprised of about
250 testical lobules. There are about 1000 convoluted tubules which are called
seminiferous tubules in them. Sperm mother cells are produced in seminferous
tubules.
² Pair of epididymis
All the vas efferens in a testes emerge out of the testes and are opened to a single
convoluted tube called epididymis. Sperms are temporarily stored in it.
² Pair of vas deferens
The tube that brings sperms from epididymis is called vas deferens. The other end
of it is joined to the tube coming from seminal vesicles.
² Pair of seminal vesicles, prostrate gland and pair of cowper's glands
These are the glands associated with male reproductive system. These glands secrete
a white fluid. This secretion is released into the urethra. This fluid is important to
provide nutrition to the sperms and their transportation. Sperms and this white fluid
is collectively known as seminal fluid or semen.
² Penis
This is the muscular organ which is important in ejection of semen into female
reproductive system. This becomes rigid when blood supply is increased. Urethra
opens out through penis. The tip of the penis is called glans penis and it is covered
by prepuce or foreskin.

Functions of male reproductive system
Production of sperms begins when a male attains his puberty. Sperms are formed
from the sperm mother cells which are in the seminiferous tubules. When sperms
are temporarily stored in epididymis. During the copulation, sperms pass through
vas deferens and are collected to the urethra. At the same time, the secretion of the
prostrate gland and Cowper's glands are also mixed with sperms. The secretion
mixed with sperms is called seminal fluid or semen. There are millions of sperms in
one milliliter (1 ml) of semen.

Process of generating sperms is very sensitive
to temperature. The temperature in the testes
should be lower than body temperature for
the production of healthy sperms. That is the
reason for testes to be in a sac called scrotum
out side the body. Matured sperm is motile and
consists of three parts named head, body and
tail.

Female reproductive system
Main parts of the female reproductive system
² Ovary
There is a pair of ovaries close to the lateral walls of pelvic area in the abdominal
cavity. In a cross section of an ovary, there are two zones known as cortex and
medulla. Ova are produced in follicles. Each ovary contains primary follicles and
various stages of production of ova such as graafian follicles, corpus luteum and
corpus albicans. Production of ova starts at the birth of a female.
² Fallopian tube
Ovum that comes out of the ovary enters into long muscular tube called fallopian
tube. The end of this tube, which is close to the ovary is funnel-like and has finger-
like projections called fimbria. These are important in transferring the ovum into
fallopian tube.
² Uterus
This is a hollow structure positioned in pelvic area. There are three zones in uterus
named as fundus, body and cervix. Two follopian tubes are connected to the zone
called fundus. The other end of uterus is cervix.
² Vagina or Endocervical canal
Vagina starts from the cervix and opens to the exterior from the opening called
vulva.

Functions of female reproductive system
Production of ova in females initiate since foetal stage. At birth each ovary contains
200 000 - 400 000 primary follicles. Nearing puberty, one of the primary follicles
develops to form a multicellular structure called graafian follicle. It reaches the
peripheral area of the ovary.
When matured, graafian follicle bursts to release the ovum which is directed
towards the fallopian tube by fimbria. Then the ovum passes through the fallopian
tube towards the uterus.

Activities of female reproductive system
² Developing ova which are the female reproductive cells
² Facilitate the developing of foetus
² Production of hormones Oestrogen and Progesterone
² Menstrual cycle
The cyclic process associated with the reproductive systems of sexually matured
females as known as menstrual cycle. It takes appoximately 28 days for one
menstrual cycle.
Here the pair of ovaries releases the egg cells or ova alternatively. The whole
process of menstrual cycle takes place associated with two locations.
1. Changes that take place in the ovary
2. Changes that take place in the uterus
Changes that take place in the ovary
Development and release of ova, which are the female reproductive cells, is the
function of ovary. Changes that occur in the ovary can be divided into two stages.

Figure 14.27 - Changes in the ovary during menstrual cycle
• Follicular Phase
This is the initial phase. Under the influence of Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH),
secreted by pituitary, a primary follicle in the ovary develops to form a graafian
follicle, which is ready to release an ovum. This takes about 14 days. During this
phase, ovary secrets Oestrogen.
52
For free distribution
• Luteal Phase
This is the final phase. When graafian follicle is matured, it bursts and the ovum
inside it, is released from the ovary into the fallopian tube, under the influence
of Lutenising Hormone (LH), secreted by pituitary gland. If fertilization does not
occur, when the ovum is passing forward through fallopian tube, the remaining part
of graafian folicle changes to form corpus luteum and finally to corpus albicans and
fades off. This whole process occurs during luteal phase and it takes about 14 days,
During this phase ovary secrets progesterone.
Changes that take place in uterus
If an ovum is fertilized, the embryo develops in the uterus. If an ovum is not
fertilized, changes that occur in uterus are divided into three phases.

• Menstrual phase
This is the initial phase. If fertilization does not take place, level of Progesterone
decreases. This causes the degradation of the wall of uterus and it is expelled out
from the body through vagina with blood. This is referred to as menstrual flow and
occurs for about four days.
53
For free distribution
• Proliferation phase
This is the second phase. Degraded wall of uterus starts to re-build because of the
influence of Oestrogen. New cell layer and blood capillaries grow on the inner wall
of the uterus. It takes about 10 days for this.
• Secretory phase
This is the final phase. Uterine wall thicknes and blood supply also increase. Glands
on the uterine wall are activated and it becomes secretory. This happens because
of the influence of hormone Progesterone. It takes about 14 days for this. Body
temperature also increases slightly during this period.

² Fertilization and Implantation
During the copulation, seminal fluid (semen) is released into the vagina. Sperm
cells in semen, swimming in the fluid, pass through uterus towards the upper
part of fallopian tube. Then one of the sperms fuses with the ovum passing down
towards uterus. Here nucleic matter of the ovum and the sperm fuses together. This
phenomenon is called fertilization.
Figure 14.30 - Fertilization of a sperm and an ovum
54
For free distribution
Fertilized ovum is referred to as zygote. While it is rolling towards uterus, it divides
to increase the number of cells. Then it is known as morula. Morula disintegrates the
tissues of uterine wall, sinks and deposits in the wall. This is known as implantation
or interplantation.

² Development of foetus
After implantation, foetal development occurs with the division of cells. In about
six weeks, protective membranes called embryonic membranes develop. There is a
fluid in them. Foetus is sunk in this fluid. The place that the embryonic membranes
connect with uterine wall is known as placenta. Material exchange from mother to
foetus and foetus to mother occurs through umbilical cord. Umbilical cord is the
tissue in placental mammals, through which nutrients and oxygen are exchanged
between the mother and the foetus. Though nutrients, oxygen and agents of diseases
(some disease causing microoganisms like virus) transfer from mother to foetus,
blood exchange does not occur through umbilical cord. Removal of excretory
products and carbondixoide also occurs through umbilical cord. Principle changes
in foetal development with time are given in the table below.

² Child birth or Parturition
When it is close to child birth, head of the foetus in uterus, turns towards vagina.
After completion of development for about 280 days, foetus is pushed outside
through vagina by the contraction of muscles of uterus. This process is known
as child birth or parturition. Further contraction of uterine wall, disconnects the
placenta and associated tissues.
After parturition the umbilical cord that connected placenta and foetus is cut and
tied.
Assignment 14.4
• List out the materials that pass from mother to foetus through umbilical cord.
• List out the materials that pass from foetus to mother through placenta.
Hormonal co-ordination
Human reproduction process is completely regulated by hormones. This can be seen
in both males and females. Here several hormones such as FSH, LH, Testosterone,
Oestrogen, Progesterone, secreted by several endocrine glands are important.

14.4 Sexually transmitted diseases
Diseases transmit from one person to another, mainly because of a sexual contact and
sexual secretions are known as sexually transmitted diseases.These are transmitted
due to blood transmission too. Symptoms of such diseases can usually be found on
sex organs. About 20 of such diseases are identified so far. Some of them, which are
common, are discussed below.
• Gonorrhoea
This is transmitted by a bacterium called Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Secretions from
sex organs, pain, blockage of fallopian tube are some of its symptoms. This disease
can be cured and if not treated it will result in blindness and lameness.
• Syphilis
This is transmitted by a bacterium called Treponema pallidum. After about three
months of infection, painless blisters appear on sex organs.They are automatically
cured. After about six months, fever and pain in throat appears. If treated in early
stages this disease can be cured. Pathogens can exist in blood for a long time and
can spread to other organs also.
• Herpes
This is transmitted by a virus called Herpes simplex. Highly painful blisters on sex
organs are the symptoms. This inactivates the nervous system and is deep-rooted.
Though it is not fatal, it has no permanent treatment.
• Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)
This is transmitted by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Symptoms may
appear in about 2- 15 years after infection. This may be fatal and cannot be cured.
AIDS is transmitted by sexual secretions and blood. To keep off from this disease,
risk activities and vectors should be avoided.
It is possible to avoid sexually transmitted diseases by being responsible during
sexual activities.

Summary
² Reproduction of organisms is of two types. They are sexual reproduction
and asexual reproduction.
² Sexual reproduction is the reproduction, associated with sexual structures
and sexual processes.
² The principle method of asexual reproduction in plants is the vegetative
propagation by aerial or underground parts.
² Natural vegetative propagation of plants occur by roots, leaves, suckers,
runners, bulbils and underground stems
² Artificial vegetative propagation of plants is carried out by methods like
stem cuttings, layering, grafting and tissue culture
² Flower, which is the sexual structure of plants, consists of calyx, corolla,
androecium and gynoecium.
² Animals, wind and water contribute, for pollination of flowers. Flowers
have special adaptations for pollination by each agent.
² After pollination, flowers produce fruits and seeds. Animals, wind, water,
and explosive mechanism contribute for dispersal of fruits and seeds.
² Sexual maturity of man is referred to as puberty. Secondary sexual
characteristics appear at this stage.
² Male reproductive system produces sperms and female reproductive system
produces ova for sexual reproduction.
² Embryo is developed by the zygote which results in the process of
fertilization of a sperm and an ovum.
² The cyclic process that is associated with the reproductive system of sexually
matured females is menstrual cycle.
² Gonorrhoea, Syphilis, Herpes and AIDS are some of the diseases that are
sexually trasmitted.

Hydrostatic pressure
and its applications
Physics

15.1 Pressure
Let us review what you have previously learnt about the pressure experienced by
surfaces due to solid objects.
Pressure is the force acting on a unit area.
Pressure =
Perpendicular force applied (F)
area (A)
F
A
The unit of pressure is Newtons per square meter (Nm-2).
As a tribute to the French scientist Blaise Pascal, this unit
has been named as the Pascal (Pa).
1 N m-2 = 1 Pa
Since pressure has only a magnitude, it is a scalar.
Example 1
A cubic shaped box is placed on a table. If the weight of the box is 400 N and the
area of the bottom of the box is 0.2 m2, find the pressure exerted on the surface of
the table under the box.

The pressure exerted by a pile of soil distributed over an area of 8 m2 of the ground
is 150 Pa. What is the force exerted on the ground due to the pile of soil?
Pressure =
Force
Area
Force = Pressure × area
= 150 N m-2 × 8 m2
= 1200 N
15.2 Hydrostatic pressure
Pressure is exerted not only by solids, liquids also exert pressure. When we place a
solid object on a table, a pressure is exerted on the table because the force acting on
the table due to the weight of the object spreads over the total contact area between
the object and the table.
Similarly, a pressure is exerted on the bottom of a container because, the force
acting on the bottom of the container due to the weight of the liquid spreads over
the bottom surface of the container. The pressure is exerted by the liquid not only
on the bottom of the vessel. The vertical walls of the vessel will also experience the
pressure. Apart from this, there are many more characteristics of pressure due to
liquids (hydrostatic pressure). Let us investigate these characteristics of hydrostatic
pressure.
If you make some holes in a polythene bag,
fill it with water and hold it as shown in Figure
15.1, what would you observe? You will
observe that water exits through all the holes.
Each of these holes exist at a different side of
the bag. Water exits from through every hole
because water pressure exists at the position
of every hole. From this experiment you will
observe that the water pressure acts in every
direction.

filled with water

For free distribution
Take a plastic bottle with a height of
about 25 cm, make several holes at
the same level near the bottom and fill
it with water. You will see water
exiting the bottle as shown in Figure
15.2. You will notice
the
horizontal distance traveled by water
coming out of every hole is the same.
This is because the pressure at the
same level of a liquid is the same.
that
Figure 15.2 – Set-up for comparing the hydrostatic
pressure at the same level
Now let us find out how the height of the
water column in a vessel affects the pressure.
Make a set of approximately equally spaced
holes from top to bottom of a plastic bottle
with a height of about 25 cm and fill it with
water. Hold the bottle at some height from
the ground level as shown in Figure 15.3 and
observe how the streams of water leave the
bottle.
Figure 15.3 - Variation of the
pressure with the height of the
liquid column
You will observe that the speed of the streams
of water coming from lower holes is greater
than the speed of water coming from upper
holes. Water exiting a hole has a higher speed when the pressure near that hole is
higher. Therefore, it can be concluded that the pressure in a liquid increases with
the depth of the liquid.
Let us engage in Activity 15.1 in order to find out how the pressure of a liquid
depends on the shape of the liquid column.

Find five transparent tubes
having various shapes as
shown by a, b, c, d and e in
Figure 15.4. Fix them to a

shown, and fill the system
with water. Record
the
vertical heights of the water
columns in each tube.
Tube

b
c

e
You will notice that the height of the liquid column of each of the tubes is the same.
It is clear from the above experiments that the pressure at the equal levels of a liquid
is the same. Therefore the pressure at the places where all the tubes are fixed to the
PVC tube is also equal. The height of the liquid column of each of the tube is being
the same, we can conclude that the pressure due to a liquid column depends only
on the height of the liquid column and not on the amount of liquid or the shape of
the liquid column.
According to our studies so far on pressure due to a liquid, the liquid pressure has
the following characteristics.
(i) The pressure at a certain point in a liquid depends on the height of the liquid
column above that point. Pressure increases with the height of the liquid
column.
(ii) The pressure at the same level of a liquid is the same.
(iii) At a given point in a liquid, the pressure is the same in all directions.
(iv) Liquid pressure depends on the vertical height of the liquid column. It does not
depend on the shape of the liquid column.
66
For free distribution
If the height of the liquid column is h and the density of the liquid is ρ, the weight
of the liquid column above a unit area of the bottom surface of the container is hρg.
mass of the liquid column = density × volume
= ρ × area of its base × height
= ρ × 1 × h = h ρ
weight of the liquid column = h ρ g
As we are concerned with the pressure on the base of the column, we divide the
force by the area. Since this weight spreads over a unit area, the liquid pressure at
the bottom is hρg. This result is true not only for the pressure at the bottom but for
any other depth of a container. If there is a liquid column of height h above any
point in a liquid as shown in Figure 15.5, then the liquid pressure P at that point is
given by,
P = h ρ g
h
ρ
Figure 15.5 - Pressure at a point
situated at a depth h in a liquid
When the unit of h is meters (m), the unit of ρ is
kg m-3 and the unit of g is m s-2, the unit of pressure (P)
exerted by the liquid column is N m-2. As mentioned
before, the commonly used unit of pressure, the
Pascal (Pa), is defined as 1 N m-2.
Example 1
At a certain location, the depth of a certain point in a lake is 1.5 m. Find the pressure

15.3 Transmission of pressure through liquids
Liquids do not get compressed by forces exerted on them. Therefore, the pressure
exerted at one point in a liquid can be transmitted to another point in the liquid.
A machine constructed to operate based on this principle is known as hydraulic
press. Figure 15.6 illustrates the working principle of a hydraulic press

It consists of a liquid volume trapped by two pistons A and B on either side of a
cylindrical liquid columns. Assume that the area of piston A is 10 cm2 and the area
of piston B is 200 cm2. If a force of 20 N is applied on piston A, the pressure it
exerts on the liquid,
P =

= 2 × 104 N m-2
= 20 000 N m-2
= 2 N cm-2
68
For free distribution
This pressure is transmitted to piston B through the liquid. Therefore, pressure at
piston B is also 2 N cm-2. That is, the fluid exerts a force of 2 N vertically upwards
on each 1 cm2 of piston B. Therefore the total force exerted on the total area of
200 cm2 of piston B is 400 N (2 x 200). It is possible to transmit a force of 400 N
to the larger piston from a total force of 20 N acting on the smaller piston because
it is possible to transmit pressure through the liquid. (Since the forces acting on
the pistons of liquid pressure machines are very high compared to the force due
to the weight of the liquid column, the force exerted by the liquid column is not
considered in calculations).
Hoists that lift vehicles in motor vehicle service stations are built based on the
principle of pressure transmission through fluids. Figure 15.7 shows the principle
of operation of one type of such hoists.

Figure 15.7 - A hoist used to lift vehicles
This hoist is constructed in such a way that the pressure generated in the oil through
the small force applied on the small piston is transmitted to the large piston through
the oil, transmitting a force equal to the weight of the vehicle placed on the large
piston. This force lifts the vehicle.
However, in order to lift a vehicle, the small piston must be moved by a large
distance. Because this is difficult, in actual hoists used in service stations, the small
piston is replaced by a compressor that pumps oil into the small cylinder.
A jack is used to lift one side of a vehicle when a wheel of the vehicle needs to be
detached. Out of the many types of jacks available, the type that is most frequently
used is the hydraulic jack. such a jack shown in the figure 15.8 . The hydraulic jack
also operates on the principle of pressure transmission.
69
For free distribution
Here also a force is applied on a small piston. The pressure caused in the oil by this
force is transmitted to the large piston through the oil, lifting one side of the vehicle.

Another instance where the principle of liquid pressure transmission is applied is

Figure 15.9 – Vehicle break system
In the break system of a vehicle, when the driver applies a force on the break-pedal, it
is transmitted to the piston in the master cylinder. This force exerts a pressure on
the oil inside the cylinder. This pressure is then transmitted through the oil to the
slave cylinder near the wheel. Then the brake-pads connected to the slave cylinder
are pressed to apply a pressure on the break-discs or break-drums. Since the
cross-sectional area of the slave cylinder is larger than that of the master cylinder,
the force applied on the break-pads by the slave cylinder is greater than the force
applied by the driver on the break-pedal.

Exercise 15.1
(1) The pressure exerted at the bottom of a container due to a liquid inside
it is 1500 Pa. What is meant by "the pressure is 1500 pa"?
(2) Find the pressure exerted by a mercury column of height 10 cm. (Density of
mercury is 13600 kg m-3).
(3) The depth of a pond is 1.5 m. Calculate the pressure caused by the water at the
bottom of the pond.
(4) The depth at a certain point in the sea is 1 km. Find the pressure exerted by
sea water at the bottom of the sea at that point. (Density of sea water is 1050
kg m-3.)
(5) A tank with a length 5 m, width 3 m and depth 2 m is filled with a liquid of
density 800 kg m-3.
(a) What is the pressure at the bottom of the tank due to the liquid ?
(b) What is the force acting on the bottom of the tank due to that pressure?
15.4 Pressure due to gases
Similar to solids and liquids, gases also exert pressure. There are two ways in
which a pressure can be produced by a gas. One is the pressure caused by the
weight of a column of gas, similar to the pressure caused by a column of liquid.
The atmospheric pressure is produced this way. The other way that a gas can give
rise to a pressure is when a compressed gas attempts to expand. From the activity
described below you can easily see that a compressed a gas causes a pressure.

● Pour water into a U-tube as shown in Figure 15.10(a). Then the water levels
in the two arms X and Y would become equal.
● Tie the opening of an air filled balloon with a piece of thread making sure that
it can be easily untied.
● Next, connect it to the arm X of the U-tube as shown in Figure 15.14(b) and
tie it with another piece of thread.
● Now slowly undo the knot on the balloon. After removing the knot, you will
be able to see that the water level in arm X goes down while the water level
in arm Y goes up. (Figure 15.10(c))
Since the pressure at all points on the same level of a liquid is the same, the
liquid levels that are equal before connecting the balloon show that the pressures
above the water levels of the two arms are equal.
By filling a balloon with air, we try to restrict a large amount of air inside a
limited volume. That is, we compress the air. When we connect the balloon
filled with compressed air to arm X, the water levels are no longer the same. The
higher water level in arm Y than the water level in arm X shows that the pressure
in arm X at the liquid surface is higher than the pressure in arm Y at the liquid
surface. The reason for the higher pressure in arm X is the additional pressure
exerted on the liquid by the compressed air in the balloon.
Atmospheric Pressure
Earth’s atmosphere extends to hundreds of kilometers above the surface of the earth.
Similar to the pressure produced at any point inside a container filled with water by
the water above that point, a pressure exists at any point in the atmosphere due to
the weight of the air above that point. This pressure is known as the atmospheric
pressure.
The atmospheric pressure was measured for the first time by the Italian scientist
Torricelli. The instrument he used for that purpose is shown in Figure 15.11.

Figure 15.11 – Mercury barometer
This instrument can be made of a glass tube, about one meter long, with one closed
end. The tube is filled with mercury, turned upside down while making sure that
no air enters the tube, and then immersed in a container of mercury as shown in
figure 15.11. When the tube is mounted in up-right position as shown in figure,
it would be possible to see that the mercury column in the tube drops by several
centimeters, leaving an empty space above the mercury column. The height of the
mercury column left inside the tube is about 76 cm.
Torricelli understood that all the mercury in the tube does not flow down to the
container because the atmospheric pressure keeps pushing on the mercury surface
exposed to the outside. However, the atmospheric pressure is sufficient to balance
the pressure of a mercury column with height of 76 cm. Therefore, the height of the
mercury column is a measure of the atmospheric pressure. Because no air can enter
the space above the mercury column, that space must be a vacuum.
We know that any two points at the same level of a liquid have the same pressure.
Accordingly, since the pressure on the mercury surface outside the tube is equal to
the atmospheric pressure, a point inside the tube at the same level should also have
the atmospheric pressure. By considering the height of the mercury column, the
pressure at the point inside the tube can be calculated using the formula P = hρg.
Therefore, the atmospheric pressure must be equal to hρg.
However, as a convenient unit for measuring pressure, the height of the mercury
column is often used. If the experiment is done at the sea level, the height of the
mercury column would be 76 cm. If the tube is immersed further into the container
with mercury, the height of the mercury column would remain at 76 cm. The space
above the column would be reduced in height. If we incline the tube, even though
the physical length of the mercury would increase, the vertical height of the mercury
column would remain at 76 cm.
73
For free distribution
While the atmospheric pressure at the sea level is 76 cm Hg, as we move up from
the sea level, the height of the air column decreases and the atmospheric pressure
decreases. For example, the atmospheric pressure at the top of Everest is about 25
cm Hg. In addition, the atmospheric pressure can change according to the weather.
The instrument constructed using mercury in order to measure the atmospheric
pressure is known as the mercury barometer.

In addition, there are barometers that do not contain a liquid. They are known as
aneroid barometers. Figure 15.12 shows an aneroid barometer without a liquid. It
has a cavity bounded by thin metallic walls in which air has been evacuated. When
the pressure outside barometer varies, the shape of the walls of the cavity also
varies. An indicator attached to the cavity walls rotates with the variations of the
shape of the walls. The pressure can be read out from an attached scale.
Applications of the atmospheric pressure in daily life
(I) Drinking with the use of a straw
When we drink using a straw, we suck the air
inside the straw and that air enters the mouth,
reducing the pressure inside the straw. The
pressure at the liquid surface outside the
straw is at the atmospheric pressure while the
pressure inside the straw is less than the

Figure 15.14 illustrates the use of the siphon
method to draw water from the tank A

situated at a lower level. Initially, the tube
has to be filled with water and one end
pressed with a finger so that water does not
flow out and then the tube should be
lowered down to of A. Thereafter, when
the finger is removed, water starts to flow
to tank B from tank A.

The pressure at the end of the tube in A
is equal to the sum of the pressures due to the water column in A above the
end of the tube and the atmospheric pressure. Since the end of the tube in B
is exposed to the atmosphere, the pressure there is equal to the atmospheric
pressure. Therefore, the higher pressure in tank A, pushes the water to the other
end of the tube at tank B which has a lower pressure.

15.4 Floatation
We know that when we put a stone into a vessel containing water, it would sink
while something like a piece of wood would float. Let us investigate what scientific
principles lie behind the reasons for some objects to sink in water while some
objects to float.
Upthrust
When we press an object that floats on water, such as a plank of wood on a water
surface, we experience a force exerted by the water acting upwards. Even for an
object that sinks in water, the weight that we feel when it is in water is less than
its weight in air. This is becuase water exerts an upward force on objects that are
immersed in water. This upward force is known as the upthrust. Not only water,
any fluid exerts an upthrust on objects that are immersed or upthrust exerts on
floating bodies too in that fluid.

• Now exert a downward force on the piece of metal as shown in Figure 15.16 (b).
Read the corresponding reading on the spring balance. It would be seen that
the spring balance reading has increased as a downward force has acted. then,
exert an upward force on the piece of metal as shown in Figure 15.16 (c) and
read the spring balance reading. It is obvious that the spring balance reading
would decrease as an additional force was exerted upwards. This shows clearly
that a downward force acting on the object would increase the spring balance
reading while an upward force would decrease the spring balance reading.
• Now immerse the object in water as shown in figure 15.16 (d) and read the
spring balance reading. You will observe that the spring balance reading has
decreased. According to the explanation given regarding the figure (c), the
spring balance reading decreases when an upward force is acting on the object.
Therefore, this confirms that an object immersed in a liquid (fluid) experiences
an upward thrust exerted by the liquid.

The conclusion that can be drawn from the results shown in the table above is that
when the object is partially or fully submerged in water, the upward thrust acting on
the object is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the object. This is known
as the Archimedes’ principle as it was first introduced by the scientist Archimedes.
Archimedes’ Principle
When an object is partially or completely submerged in a fluid, the upthrust
acting on it is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.
The figure 15.18 shows how three different objects A, B and C are submerged in
water.

Object A is partially submerged and floating while object B is fully submerged and

Can you think of the reason for this difference? Engage in the following activity in
order to understand it.
Activity 15.5
You will need three objects of different materials. One of them (A) should float
in water, partially submerged. Another one (B) should float on water, fully
submerged. Such an object could be obtained by filling an appropriate quantity

sink in water.
• Measure the weights of the three objects A, B and C.
• Now measure the apparent weights of the three objects while A is floating,
partially submerged, B is floating, fully submerged and C is sunk.

The results obtained from this activity are stated below.
The weight of the object that was partially submerged while floating and the weight
of the object that was fully submerged while floating are equal to the upthrust
exerted on the objects by water. The weight of the object that sank in water is
greater than the upthrust exerted on the object by water.
When a force acting vertically downwards is applied on the object A that was
partially submerged while floating, an additional force acting vertically upwards
can be experienced. This is because the upthrust is greater than the weight of
the object when the object is fully immersed in water giving rise to a resultant
force acting upwards. Therefore, when the external force was removed. the object
returns to the original position. That is, the object returns to the position where the
upthrust is equal to the weight of the object.
The conclusion that could be drawn from this is, that the weight of an object that is
partially or fully immersed in a fluid while floating is equal to the upthrust acting on
the object and the weight of an object that is fully sunk in the fluid is greater than
the upward thrust, the object sinks in the fluid.
That is,
If the upthrust acting on an object fully immersed in a fluid,
(a) is less than the weight of the object, the object sinks in the fluid.
(b) is equal the weight of the object, the object floats in the fluid while being fully
submerged in it.

(c) is greater than the weight of the object, the object floats while partially

Hydrometer
Glass stem

Scale
Hydrometers are used to measure the density of
liquids and solutions. It is made of glass. It has a
cylindrical stem and a bulb as shown in the diagram.
Mercury or lead shots are found inside the bulb to
enable it to float vertically in the liquid .The liquid or
the solution is taken to a vessel and the hydrometer is
put in to it. Then the density of the liquid or the
solution can be read directly by the scale given on the
hydrometer.
Lead shots
Hydrometer has been made in accordance with the
Archimedes' principle. The hydrometer immerses
in the liquid to a height so as to displace a weight
equal to the weight of the hydrometer. The volume
of the liquid or the solution displaced is equal to the
volume of the immersed part of the hydrometer. As
a small volume of the liquid is displaced in a high density liquid, the hydrometer is
immersed to only small depth. But when it is put in a low density liquid it immerses
more because more liquid should displace, to produce the upthrust required to
balance it.

• The pressure due to a liquid acts in every direction.
• The pressure due to a liquid increases as the depth (height of a column of
liquid) increases.
• The formula P = h ρ g is used to find the pressure due to a liquid column
where
h = height of the liquid column

16.2 Chemical Equations
A chemical equation is the symbolic representation of a chemical reaction using
chemical formulae. When writing chemical equations in the standard form, reactants
are written on the left hand side and the products on the right hand side. An arrow
indicates the direction of a reaction. For a reaction, there may be several reactants
as well as several products.
Reactants + Reactants
Products + Products
In such instances placing (+) mark between them is the accepted way. Moreover,
the reacting substances as well as the substances produced are indicated by their
chemical symbols and formulae. To write a chemical equation correctly, one should
know chemical symbols and formulae as well.
Now let us try to write the reaction between magnesium and oxygen in the form of
an equation.

According to the law of conservation of mass you have learnt, atoms are neither
created nor destroyed during a reaction, so the number of atoms of the respective
elements in the reactants should be equal to their number of atoms in the products.
Equating the number of atoms of reactants with those of the products is known as
balancing the equation.
Mg + O2
MgO
Follow the following steps to balance the above equation.
There are two oxygen atoms in the reactants. Products contain one oxygen atom. To
balance oxygen, magnesium oxide cannot be written as MgO2 because the formula
of magnesium oxide produced by the above reaction is MgO. Therefore, 2 is written
in front of MgO.
Mg + O2
2MgO
When writing ‘2 MgO’, two magnesium atoms are present in the products. But
there is only one magnesium atom on the reactant side. So, ‘2’ should come in front
of Mg. This gives the following equation.
2Mg + O2
This is the balanced chemical equation of the reaction between magnesium
2MgO
and oxygen.
Study carefully how the balanced chemical equation is written for the following
reaction also.
Reaction: Aluminium metal reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid forming aluminium
chloride and hydrogen.
Write the formulae of the reactants and products correctly on either side of the
arrow.
Al + HCl
AlCl3 + H2
Three chlorine atoms and two hydrogen atoms are present in the products. Since
the least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6, write 6 as the coefficient of hydrochloric
acid.
Al + 6HCl
AlCl3 + H2
Now there are 6 hydrogen atoms in the products, so write 3 as the coefficient of H2.
As there are six chlorine atoms in the reactants insert 2 as the coefficient of AlCl3.
Al + 6HCl

There are two aluminium atoms in the reactants. Hence write 2 as the coefficient

When words are used to write a given chemical reaction, we face lot of difficulties.
Understand this through the following examples.
Given below is the reaction between haematite (Fe2O3 ) and carbon monoxide.
Fe2O3 + 3CO
2Fe + 3CO2
Writing in words does not show the ratio of atoms of elements constituting
compounds. But when written as chemical formulae, the ratio of elements in the
compound can be definitely known. Then the equation can be balanced. Once
the balanced equation is found, the ratio of masses of the respective elements or
compounds that should be mixed to obtain the maxiumum amount of the produts
when performing the reaction practically can be calculated. So, writing equations
using chemical symbols and formulae not only makes the task easier but also helps
calculations.
By the above equation written using the symbols and formulae, following
information can be obtained.
» Knowing the relative atomic masses of the elements (Fe =56; O=16; C=12),
the relative molar masses can be obtained as Fe2 O3 = 160 g mol-1,
CO = 28 g mol-1and CO2 = 44 g mol-1.
Thus,
(a) three moles of carbon monoxide (CO) is required to react with one mole of
haematite (Fe2O3).
Hence, 28 x 3g (84 g) of carbon monoxide are required to react with
160 g of haematite.
(b) Two moles of iron are formed in the above reaction.
Thus, 56 x 2 g (112 g) of iron are formed in the above reaction.
(c) Three moles of carbon dioxide are formed in the above reaction.
So, 44 x 3 g (132 g) of carbon dioxide are formed in the above reaction.
16.3 Reactivity of Metals

iron rust fast. But jewellery made of gold do not tarnish even after a long period of

time. Have you inquired into the causes for this difference? You can have an answer
for this by studing how metals react with air, water and dilute acids.
Let us carry out Activity 16.3 to investigate how metals react with air.
Activity - 16.3
Requirements: A freshly cut piece of sodium, a cleaned magnesium ribbon
about 2 cm long
• Expose the freshly cut piece of sodium and the cleaned 2cm magnesium ribbon
to air.
• Observe well the cut surface of the piece of sodium and the magnesium ribbon.
• Record your observations.
It is seen that the lustrous nature of the surface of sodium metal diminishes . We
cannot see any noteworthy change in the magnesium ribbon. The reason for the
disappearance of the shiny nature of the piece of sodium is that it reacts fast with
the components in air. Magnesium does not react fast with the components in air.
When burnt in air, metals like sodium and magnesium react with oxygen to form
their oxides.
4Na + O2
2Mg + O2
2 Na2O
2MgO
When heated in air, the surface of metals like zinc (Zn), iron (Fe) and copper (Cu)
becomes dull. Prolonged heating turns them into the oxides.
2Zn + O2
2ZnO
Metals like silver (Ag), platinum (Pt) and gold (Au) are not converted to their
oxides. how strongly they are heated.
Based on these facts, it can be concluded that metals differ in their readiness of
reacting with oxygen.
² Reactions of Metals with Water
Some metals react with cold water, hot water and water vapour at different speeds.
Hence, it is clear that the reactively of metal towards water differ from one another.
To confirm this, let us do activities 16.4 and 16.5.
95
For free distribution
Chemistry
Activity - 16.4
Changes in Matter
Requirements: A trough, water, a piece of sodium metal, a red litmus paper
• Under the guidance of the teacher add a small piece of sodium (the size of a
seed of green gram) to the water in the trough.
• Record the observations.
The piece of sodium darts on the surface of water swiftly with a hissing sound.
The piece of sodium which is small catches fire if it stays motionless. The red
litmus paper in the trough turns blue. Sodium reacts violently with water liberating
hydrogen gas. Turning red litmus blue shows the formation of an alkaline (basic)
solution.
What happens here is that sodium reacts with cold water giving sodium hydroxide,
a basic solution and hydrogen.
2Na + 2H2O
2NaOH + H2
Activity - 16.5
Requirements: A beaker, water, a cleaned magnesium ribbon
• Put the cleaned magnesium ribbon into the beaker of water. Record the
observations.
• Heat the beaker of water with the burner. Record the observations.
Magnesium does not give any observable reaction with cold water. But when
reacting with hot water, liberation of gas bubbles can be seen.
Magnesium reacts with hot water giving magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen gas.
Mg + 2H2O
Mg(OH)2 + H2
Magnesium reacts fast with steam. The products of the reaction are magnesium
oxide and hydrogen gas.
Mg + H2O
MgO + H2
Aluminum and zinc do not react with cold water or hot water. On heating in steam,
they form the corresponding oxide and hydrogen gas.
Zn + H2O
ZnO + H2
Iron does not react with cold water or hot water. When heated in steam it gives the
metal oxide and hydrogen gas.

Pay your attention to the
sign in the above equation. It indicates
that the above reaction is reversible. That means the products can be formed
from the reactants and also the reactants can be formed from the products.
Metals like silver, platinum and gold do not react with cold water, hot water and
even with steam. Foregoing facts show that the reactivity of metals with water
varies with the metal.
² Reactions of Metals with Dilute Acids
Hydrochloric acid (HCl), nitric acid (HNO3) and sulphuric acid (H2SO4) are the
frequently used acids in the laboratory.
Let us engage in Activity 16.6 to study the reactions of metals with dilute
hydrochloric acid.
Activity - 16.6
Requirements: About 100 ml of dilute hydrochloric acid solution, identical test
tubes, the metals aluminum (Al), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), magnesium (Mg) and
iron (Fe)
Add 100 ml of dilute hydrochloric acid solution each to a few test tubes.
Add pieces of metals magnesium, aluminum, zinc, copper and iron with well
cleaned surfaces separately to the test tubes and observe. Compare the rate
of fizzing.
Gas bubbles evolve fast from the test tubes containing magnesium, aluminum
and zinc. Gas bubbles liberate slowly from the test tube containing iron. No gas
bubbles are set free from the test tube containing copper.
Mg + 2HCl
2Al + 6HCl
Zn + 2HCl
Fe + 2HCl
MgCl2 + H2
2AlCl3 + 3H2

HCl is called hydrogen chloride when it exits as a gas. When hydrogen chloride
gas is dissolved in water the solution is called hydrochloric acid.
This shows that the rate of reactions of metals with dilute acids differ according
to the type of the metal. It is seen that copper metal does not react with dilute
hydrochloric acid. Many metals react with dilute sulphuric acid also liberating
hydrogen gas.
Mg + H2SO4
MgSO4 + H2
However, reactions of metals with concentrated sulphuric acid and nitric acid may
give other gaseous products. Metals like potassium (K), sodium (Na) and calcium
(Ca) react violently with dilute acids. It may cause even an ignition with explosion.
Therefore those reactions must not be tried in the laboratory.
From the above it is seen that the reactivity of metals with acids varies with the
metal.
² Reactions of Metals with Solutions of Other Metallic Salts
Let us conduct activity 16.7 in order to explore how metals react with the solutions
of salts of metals. Copper sulphate (CuSO4) is a salt of the metal copper (Cu). An
aqueous solution of copper sulphate can be prepared by dissolving this salt in water.
Let us use the reaction of the metal zinc (Zn) with the copper sulphate solution in
this regard.
Activity - 16.7
Requirements :- A beaker, an aqueous solution of copper sulphate, cleaned
zinc metal
• Add copper sulphate solution to the beaker.
• Add a zinc granule to it.
• Record the observations.
Copper sulphate solution is blue in colour. It can be observed that the intensity of
the blue colour of the solution diminishes with the formation of a brown powder.
Here, the following single displacement reaction occurs.
CuSO4 + Zn
ZnSO4 + Cu
No reaction occurs when copper metal is added to the zinc sulphate solution.
ZnSO4 + Cu
No change is observed
98

Changes in Matter
Only a metal which is more reactive can displace another metal from an aqueous
solution of it. Accordingly, zinc is more reactive than copper, so it can displace
copper from a copper sulphate solution. But, copper cannot displace zinc from a
zinc sulphate solution. Thus, of zinc and copper, it can be inferred that zinc is the
more reactive metal.
16.4 Activity Series
The reactivity shown by metals with oxygen, water and, dilute acids is different
from one another. The activity series is built up on the basis of those observations
as well as other data. The series obtained by the arrangement of metals in the
descending order of their reactivity is referred to as the activity series. The
activity series is very important in the studies in chemistry.

• Uses of the Activity Series
• Activity series is useful to identify the precautions to be taken when storing
metals. The metals with high reactivity such as sodium (Na), potassium (K) and
calcium (Ca) should be stored in liquids such as kerosene and liquid paraffin.
Because of their high reactivity with air, they react with the components in air if
they are kept exposed to air.

Changes in Matter
• Activity series is useful to find methods that prevent corrosion of metals. Keeping
iron in contact with metals like zinc and magnesium that are more reactive than
iron to prevent rusting of iron is an example.
• Activity series helps select metals to make electrochemical cells.
• Activity series can be used to decide on the methods suitable for extracting metals.
Metals extraction involves the separation of the metal from a natural ore which
contains that metal. How the metals occur differs according to their reactivity.
• Reactive metals such as sodium (Na) and potassium (K) cannot be seen as native
metals in the natural environment. They are found as very stable ionic compounds
in the environment. In order to extract them, electrolysis, a robust method of
extracting metals has to be used. These metals are extracted by the electrolysis of
their fused (molten) chloride (to be discussed in Grade 11).
• The metals of moderate reactivity such as iron (Fe), tin (Sn), zinc (Zn) and lead
(Pb) are extracted by reducing their compounds by other elements or compounds.
• The metals of low reactivity such as Silver (Ag), gold (Au) and platinum (Pt)
occur in nature as the native metals mixed with other compounds. They are
extracted by the physical methods used to separate the mixtures.
Hence, strong extraction methods such as electrolysis are used to extract metals
at the top of the activity series. More simpler physical methods are used to extract
metals at the bottom of the activity series.
• Extraction of Iron
Now, let us pay attention to the extraction of iron, a metal which is very important
for the life of the human.

There are evidences in support of the fact that there had been a wealth of
knowledge about extraction of iron in Sri Lanka in the past. Archeological
excavations carried out recently in the Samanala wewa area have disclosed
that a furnace smelting iron ores had been operated with the aid of monsoonal
winds. A group of archeologists succeeded in reconstructing such a furnace
and producing iron by smelting the iron ore. Archeological records state that
steel for making the ceremonial sword of the Emperor of Arab had been
brought in from ‘Serendib’.

Iron is a metal placed somewhere in the middle of activity series. Iron is extracted
from the iron ore mined from the soil. The main component containing iron in the
iron ore is haematite (Fe2O3).
The structure used to extract iron is called the blast furnace. This is illustrated in
Fig. 16.1.
It is a special furnace about 60 m high. The raw materials are fed into the furnace
from the top while hot air is blown in from the bottom. Heating caused by hot air
brings about several reactions inside the furnace giving liquid iron. The temperature
range within the blast furnace is 1000 0C – 1900 0C.
The raw materials used namely iron ore (Fe2O3), limestone (CaCO3) and coke (C)
mixed in the correct proportion and powdered finely are charged from the top of
the furnace.

the new properties imparted of them and the uses of items made of those
alloys because of those properties.
3. Discuss with the teacher the advantage if any of the existence of the slag in
the blast furnace.
• Extraction of Gold
Gold (Au) is a metal that has longer historical relations with the human race than
even iron does. There are evidences for the utilization of gold to make coins, various
statues and documents. Now, let us see how this metal is extracted.
Gold, which is placed at the bottom of the activity series, does not react with any
active component of the atmosphere under normal conditions. Therefore it occurs
as the native metal in nature. But it is mixed with other impurities.
A certain amount of impurities can be removed by sifting the ore containing gold.
The density of gold is very high. Therefore, when the ore is powdered finely
and mixed into a drain of water, gold settles down first on the bottom. The metal
separated by such physical methods is purified further by various methods.
e x t r a k n o w l e d g e
F o r
Presently solvents that dissolve gold have been discovered. When the metal
with impurities is dissolved in these solvents, only gold dissolves. In order to
get the metal that has gone into the solution, it is displaced by another metal.

Since the density of hydrogen gas is less than that of the normal air, it moves up the
jar. Then the atmospheric air in the jar gets pushed down and removed. This method
of collecting a gas is called ‘downward displacement of air’.

tubing, test tubes, a trough of water, a burner, potassium permanganate.
• Under the directions of the teacher set the apparatus as shown in Fig. 16.4
in the laboratory and collect oxygen gas to a few test tubes.
• Do the following test to identify oxygen gas. Take a dry ekel. Light one
end of it. When the tip is glowing put out the flame. Take one test tube with
oxygen out of water and introduce the glowing splint into it as soon as you
open the mouth of the tube.
It is observed that the splint relights with a flame. By this oxygen gas can be
identified.
Uses of oxygen gas
• It is essential for the respiration of all organisms.
• When something burns, it reacts with oxygen. Thus, oxygen is essential
for combustion.
• It is used during underwater diving and space travel.
• It is used to generate the oxy-acetylene flame used for welding metals.
• Oxygen is used as a raw material in industries such as the production of

Carbon dioxide is a gas that contributed to the advent of life on Earth. This gas
brought the temperature of the Earth’s atmosphere to an optimal level for living
organisms and it also acts a raw material for photosynthesis, the process that meets
the food requirement of all living beings. Carbon dioxide occurs in a percentage as
small as 0.03% by volume in the atmosphere.
Physical properties of carbon dioxide gas

• Its relative molecular mass is 44.
• It neither burns, nor supports combustion.
• The gas is slightly soluble in water.

Fig. 16.6 - Collecting carbon dioxide gas by upward displacement of air
Since the density of carbon dioxide gas coming from the delivery tube is high, it reaches
to the bottom of the jar. When the gas fills the jar, air inside is displaced upwards.
Therefore this method of collecting a gas is known as ‘upward displacement of air.
Activity - 16.10
Requirement: a conical flask, a rubber stopper, a thistle funnel, glass tubing,
test tubes, a trough of water, dilute hydrochloric acid, calcium carbonate or egg
shells, a dry ekel, lime water, box of matches.
• Under the guidance of the science teacher, set the apparatus given in Fig. 16.5
and fill some test tubes with carbon dioxide gas.
• Light a dry ekel and introduce it with the flame into a test tube containing
carbon dioxide gas. The flame is immediately extinguished. The gas quickly
puts out the glow also.
• Dissolve a little slaked lime (Ca(OH)2) in about 50 ml of water carefully
are filter through a filter paper. Add about 5 ml of this solution to a test tube
containing carbon dioxide, stopper the tube tightly and shake well. Add the
same volume of lime water to a test tube with normal air, stopper and shake
well. Compare the colours of the solutions in the two test tubes.
You will see that lime water turns more milky in the test tube containing carbon
dioxide. Calcium hydroxide in lime water reacts with carbon dioxide in the test
tube as follows.

The lime water turns milky because the white calcium carbonate so formed is
suspended in water.
If more carbon dioxide is passed into the test tube containing the gas suspension,
the gas reacts with calcium carbonate forming water soluble calcium hydrogen
carbonate or calcium bicarbonate [(Ca(HCO3)2.]. Therefore the milkiness of the
solution disappears.
When carbon dioxide is cooled strongly under high pressure, the gas solidifies.
When heated the solid carbon dioxide directly turns into the gas without liquefying,
so it does not become a liquid like ice. Therefore solid carbon dioxide is known as
dry ice. Since the temperature of dry ice (-770C) is very much lower than that of ice,
it is used as a super coolant. Dry ice is largely used in food preservation. It is also
used to create artificial rains.
Uses of carbon dioxide
• Since carbon dioxide is a non-supporter of combustion it is used in
extinguishing fires.
• Since carbonic acid (H2CO3) formed when carbon dioxide dissolves in
water gives a taste, it is used in the production of soda water and fizzy drinks.
• Carbon monoxide gas, the reductant essential for extraction of iron is
produced by reacting carbon dioxide with coke.

without changing its composition such as melting of a solid, vaporization of a
liquid, condensation and solidification of a gas following cooling and freezing
of a liquid are physical changes.
• The changes that bring about the formation of new substances from the existing
substances are known as chemical changes.
• Chemical reactions are of four types-combination, decomposition, single
displacement and double displacement.
• A chemical changes can be represented by a balanced chemical equation.

• A structure called blast furnace and the raw materials hematite (Fe2O3), limestone
(CaCO3) and coke are used to extract iron.
• Gold occurs as the native (uncombined) metal in nature because its
reactivity is very low. Various physical methods are used to separate gold
mixed with impurities.

Rate of Reaction
• Surface area of reactants
Chemistry
A large log of wood can easily be burnt when it is split into small splints. Physicians
advise to chew food well for easy digestion. What is the reason for all this ?
When a solid reacts with a liquid or a gas, the reaction occurs only on the surface
of the solid. The reason for this is that the particles of reactants collide only on the
surface of the solid. Let us carry out assignment 17.2, for further clarification.
Assignment - 17.2

y Consider a cube of marble (CaCO3 ), of a side
2 cm, put into dilute hydrochloric acid
solution. Calculate the surface area of marble
that comes into contact with the acid.

y Suppose that marble cube is cut into 8 small cubes, a side of each is 1cm
in length.

c

1 cm
y Calculate the total surface area of the marble cubes touching the acid, if
those 8 small cubes are put into the acid solution.
Surface area of one side of the large cube = 2 cm X 2 cm = 4 cm2
= 4 cm2 X 6
= 24 cm2
Total area of 6 sides
= 1 cm X 1 cm = 1 cm2
= 1 cm2 X 6
= 6 cm2
= 6 cm2 X 8
= 48 cm2
Surface area of one side of a small cube
Total area of 6 sides of one small cube
The total surface area of 8 small cubes
Accordingly it is clear that the surface area increases, when a large cube is divided
into small cubes.
Let us carry out the activity 17.1 to find out, how surface area of reactants affects
the rate of a reaction.

High pressure condition

Fig. 17.1
Masses of reactants in the case of A and B are the same. But the pressure of the
reactants in B is higher than that of A, as the volume of B is reduced. Then the
rate of reaction in B is higher than that of A, because the number of collisions of
reactants per unit time is higher in B.
• Catalysts
Catalysts are the substances that increase the rate of a reaction, without being
chemically consumed during the reaction. Given below is an activity to find out
the effect of a catalyst on the rate of a chemical reaction.
2.5 ml HCl + water

Activity - 17.4
Requirement : Two test tubes, a solution of fresh hydrogen peroxide,
0.2 g of manganese dioxide
y Add equal volumes of fresh hydrogen peroxide solutions into the two test
tubes.
Let us carry out the activity 17.3 below, to find out how concentration of reactants
• Concentration of reactants
affects the rate of reactions.
Activity - 17.3
Requirement : Three pieces of cleaned magnesium ribbon of equal surface area,
three test tubes, dilute hydrochloric acid, water
² Take three test tubes and add 15 ml of water to each tube. Mark water level
of each tube with a rubber band and empty the water. Add 2.5 ml" 5.0 ml,
and 7.5 ml of dilute hydrochloric acid to the three test tubes, and fill water to
the rubber band mark of each tube.
² Introduce to each test tube a piece of magnesium ribbon and observe the
speed of fizzing.
5.0 ml HCl + water
piece of magnesium ribbon
It is observed that the speed of evolution of gas bubbles is higher when the
concentration of hydrochloric acid is high. So, it is clear that the rate of reaction
increases with the increase in concentration of hydrochloric acid.
When the concentration of reactants is increased, the number of particles of reactants
in a unit volume increases. Therefore the number of collisions of reactants per unit
time increases. This is why the rate of a reaction increases, when the concentration
of reactants is increased.
• Pressure of gaseous reactants
y Tip accurately weighed 0.2 g of manganese dioxide into one of the test tubes.
y Observe the speed of evolution of gas bubbles from the above test tubes.
2H2O (l) + O2(g)
2H2O2(aq)
y When the reaction is over, filter the solution with manganese dioxide, dry
the residue and weigh it.
The speed of evolution of gas bubbles is higher in the test tube with manganese
dioxide. Manganese dioxide has increased the rate of this reaction. Since the mass
of manganese dioxide remains the same, it has not been consumed during the
reaction. That is, manganese dioxide has acted as a catalyst for this reaction.
In addition to the substances that speed up reactions, there are substances that
reduce the rate of reactions. These are known as inhibitors.

18.1 Work
You have learnt before, that an object is said to have done work if its position or
shape changed under the action of a force applied on it. Let us investigate further
about work.
If we place an object on a horizontal plane as shown in Figure 18.1 and apply a
constant force of 1 N on it until it moves a distance of 1 m along the direction of the
force, the work done by the force is defined to be one Joule (1 J).

1 N
Figure 18.1 – Moving an object by 1 m under the action of a force of 1 N
If a constant force of 2 N acts on the object until it moves by 1 m in the direction of
the force, then the work done on the object is 2 J.

Similarly, if a constant force of 3 N acts on the object until it moves by 1 m in the
direction of the force as shown in Figure 18.3, then the work done on the object is
3 J.

in the direction of the force?
Work done = Magnitude of the × distance moved in the
direction of the force

= 7.5 N × 8 m

Example 2
The weight of an object is 40 N. What is the work done in lifting the object by a
vertical distance of 2 m?
Force that mast be applied vertically upwards to lift the 40 N weight = 40 N
Height to be lifted = 2 m
Work done = 40 N × 2 m
= 80 J

Force needed to lift the weight = 50 N

18.2 Energy
Energy is the ability to do work. The unit for measuring energy is the same unit
Joule that is used to measure the work done. We need energy to do various tasks.
There are different forms of energy that help us to do work.
Examples
Heat energy
Electric energy
Magnetic energy
Mechanical energy
Light energy
Sound energy
127
For free distribution
Out of these different forms of energy, we will discuss mechanical energy here.
There are two forms of mechanical energy and they are known as potential energy
and kinetic energy.
Kinetic energy
The energy possessed by an object due to its motion is known as kinetic energy.
As shown in Figure 18.4, project an object (A) with a certain velocity along a
horizontal floor so that it collides with a light trolley (B). After the collision, the
trolley would move some distance before coming to rest. Next, project the object
with a higher velocity. Now the trolley will move a longer distance before coming
to rest.
B
A
Figure 18.4 – Pushing an object with a velocity
In this case, part of the kinetic energy of the moving object is transferred to the
trolley setting the trolley in motion. When a higher initial velocity is given to the
object, more energy is transferred to the trolley and it moves a longer distance.
Similarly, push objects of various masses with the same velocity towards the trolley.
You will observe that the trolley would move further when knocked on by larger
masses.
From these results, it is clear that the kinetic energy depends on the two factors,
velocity and mass.
The following equation, which involves the two factors velocity and mass is used
to calculate the kinetic energy of a moving object.

When the unit of mass is kg, and the unit of velocity is m s-1, the unit of kinetic
energy is J (Joule).
Example 1
The mass of an object is 6 kg. Calculate its kinetic energy when it is moving at a
velocity of 4 m s-1.
Kinetic energy =

= 48 J
Example 2
Calculate the kinetic energy of an object of mass 4 kg at an instant that it is moving
with a velocity of 2 m s-1.
Kinetic energy =
mv2
=
× 4 × 22
= 8 J
Exercise 18.2
1) The mass of a dog is 10 kg. If its kinetic energy is
20 J at a certain instant, what would be the velocity
it is running at?
(2) The kinetic energy of an object of mass 500 g is 9 J when it is moving with a
certain velocity. Calculate the velocity of the object at that instant.
129
For free distribution
Potential energy
The energy stored in an object due to its position or due to a change in
its form is known as potential energy.
When we lift an object upwards by a certain distance, we perform work on the
object. That is, we expend some energy to bring the object to its new position. That
energy is stored in the object as potential energy.
Let us find the energy required to lift an object of mass 3 kg by a distance of 2 m as
shown in Figure 18.5 .
30N
m

3kg
30N
Figure 18.5 - Doing work against gravity
Weight of the 3 kg mass = 3 kg « 10 m s-2 = 30 N
Force required to lift the object = 30 N
Height that the object is lifted = 2 m
Work done on the object = 30 N × 2 m
= 60 J
Work done = mass of the object × gravitational acceleration × vertical distance
lifted
Work done = Weight of the object × vertical distance lifted
Weight of the object = mass of the object × gravitational acceleration
Since the work done is 60 J the energy stored in the object at a height of 2 m is 60
J. That is the potential energy of the object at a height of 2 m is 60 J.
130
For free distribution
Since work is done against gravitational attraction, this potential energy is
known as gravitational potential energy.
In the above example if we take, m as the mass of the object,
g as the acceleration due to gravity and
h as the vertical distance to the object, then
potential energy = mgh
The work done in lifting an object vertically upwards is stored in the object as
potential energy. This energy is converted back into kinetic energy when the object
is released. Let us do the following activity to show that the potential energy of an
object is greater when its vertical position is higher.
Activity 18'1
Figure 18.6 – Variation of the potential energy with height
² Spread some clay on the floor, to a thickness of about 3 cm.
² Release a fairly heavy weight from a vertical height of about 0.5 m from the clay
surface.
² Observe the depth of the depression caused on the clay surface at the point of
contact where the weight fell.
² Repeat the above procedure by releasing the weight from various heights, make
sure that the same part of the weight comes in contact with the clay surface each
time it falls.
² Each time observe the depth of the depression on the clay surface.
You will observe that the depth of the depression increases as the original height
of releasing the weight increases. The energy required to form a depression on the
131
For free distribution
clay surface was given by the falling weight. Your observations will confirm that
the energy of the weight increases as the height of the fall increases.
It will be clear to you from this activity that the potential energy stored in an object
increases in proportion to the height it is positioned.

Observe the depth of the depression formed on the clay surface as before.
Next fill about ½ of the plastic bottle with sand and release from the same
height as before.
Now fill the plastic bottle completely with sand and release it from the same
height.
You will observe that the depth of the depression on the clay surface increases with
the mass of the object. It will be clear to you that the potential energy of an object
increases with increasing mass.
When the length of a rubber band or a spring is increased by stretching it upon
applying a force, its shape changes and the work done by the displacement of the
force is stored in the rubber band or the spring. This potential energy is known as
elastic potential energy.

Suppose that the bicycle riding fast along a horizontal road had to climb up a
hill as shown in the figure 18.8. Even though the rider might not try to pedal the
bicycle now, it is possible for the bicycle to reach the hilltop due to the velocity he
had at first. However, his velocity would decrease as the bicycle moves upward.
Therefore, the kinetic energy of the bicycle would gradually decrease as it moves
up.
If he was able reach the hilltop in this manner, the rider would be able reach the
bottom of the hill without pedaling the bicycle. As he moves down the hill, his
velocity would increase gradually. In turn, the kinetic energy of the bicycle would
increase gradually.
Figure 18.8 - Riding a bicycle up of a hill
When the bicycle reached the bottom of the hill after riding along the flat road, it
had some kinetic energy. When it went up the hill, its kinetic energy decreased until
it reached a minimum value at the hilltop while its potential energy increased up to
a maximum value. When the bicycle started its decent after reaching the hilltop,
its potential energy begins to decrease while the kinetic energy begins to increase.
From this example, it would be clear to you that kinetic energy can transform into
potential energy and potential energy can transform back into kinetic energy.

gradually. However, as she reaches a higher vertical level at B, the potential energy
increases gradually. Therefore, as the child moves from point A to B, the kinetic
energy of the system gets converted into potential energy. At B the velocity is zero
and all the kinetic energy has transformed into potential energy. Thereafter, when
the child swings back to point A, the potential energy gets transformed back into
kinetic energy.

3. Sledge hammer
In breaking stones and cutting firewood, sledge-hammer is used. When cutting
wood, an iron wedge is inserted into the piece of wood to be cut and the
lifted sledge-hammer is released on to the wedge. The potential energy of the
sledge-hammer at the point of release transforms into kinetic energy whereby
it collides on the wedge with a large velocity. The kinetic energy of the sledge-
hammer gets transferred to the wedge which passes through the piece of wood,
separating it into pieces.

18.3 Power
The amount of work done in a unit time or the rate of doing work is known as
power.
If 600 Joules of work is done in 10 s,
rate of doing work or power = 600 J
10 S
= 60 J s-1
One Joule per second (1JS-1) is defined as a Watt (1W). Hence the power indicated

Current electricity
19.1 Static electricity and current electricity
Electricity is a very important form of energy to us. In the modern world, many
instruments are manufactured in a way that they could be operated using electricity.
House hold equipment such as Electric bulbs, electric irons and electric fans are
some of the examples. Electricity basically has two forms, static electricity and
current electricity.
You have learnt in grades 7 and 9 that static electricity consists of charges that
are deposited on the surfaces of insulators and that they do not flow. Now let us
investigate the behavior of static electricity.
Drinking
straw
Rub a drinking straw well with a
cotton material (Figure 19.1) and
bring it close to tiny bits of paper as
shown
in Figure 19.2. You will
observe that the bits of paper get
attracted to the straw rubbed with the
piece of cotton cloth. Also bring another straw that was not rubbed with a cotton
cloth close to tiny pieces of paper. You will notice that the bits of paper would not
be attracted to the straw.
Figure 19.1 – Rubbing a straw with a piece of
cotton cloth
Piece of cotton cloth
Rub a plastic rod, pen or a comb
against your hair and bring it near tiny
bits of paper or tiny pieces of rigifoam.
You will observe that these tiny pieces
being attracted to the items rubbed
with hair. Figure 19.2 shows little bits
of rigifoam being attracted to a rubbed
comb. Try the above with a plastic
rod that was not rubbed with hair. You
will observe that the rigifoam pieces do not get attracted to it.

For free distribution
When some objects are rubbed, they acquire a force to attract little pieces of paper,
dust and other light materials. Such objects acquire this attractive power through
the static electric charges generated by rubbing.
You have observed that objects such as a drinking straw or a comb attract tiny bits
of paper only after rubbing them and if the objects are not rubbed, they cannot
attract bits of paper.
How are static electric charges that give certain objects an attractive power
generated? All materials are composed of atoms. Atoms consist of tiny particles
known as electrons, protons and neutrons. Protons are ‘positively’ charged particles
while electrons are ‘negatively’ charged particles. Neutrons do not have a charge.
They are neutral.
Protons and neutrons are found in the centre of
an atom known as the nucleus (Figure 19.3).
Electrons are found rotating around the nucleus.
Only electrons can be removed from an atom
easily. If electrons are removed from the atoms
on the surface of an object after rubbing it with a
piece of cloth, positive charges are generated on
the surface of the object. That is, the surface is
positively (+) charged. If the object receives electrons from the piece of cloth after
being rubbed with the cloth, then the surface of the object acquires a negative
charge. That is, the surface gets negatively (-) charged.
Figure 19.3 – Subatomic particles
in an atom
Charges that are found stationary on an object in this manner are known as
electrostatic charges.
When such accumulated electrostatic charges begin to move, they give rise to an
electric current.
In order to find out how to generate an electric current from electrostatic charges let
us engage in Activity 1.

² Arrange the set-up by connecting the conducting wires to the neon bulb as
shown in Figure 19.4. Connect one terminal of the neon bulb to the earth
² Charge the PVC rod by rubbing with polythene.
² Touch the terminal of the neon bulb with the charged rod.
² Repeat the above steps several times and observe the lighting of the neon

Figure 19.4 – Lighting up of the neon bulb when the electrostatic charges

Electrostatic charges are stored on the surface of the PVC rod rubbed by polythene.
When it touches the conducting wires, the stored static charges begin to flow out via
the conducting wires. When these charges flow through the neon bulb, it lights up.
When static electric charges begin to flow in this manner, it is known as an electric
current.
A current of electric charges flowing through a conductor is known as an electric
current.

19.2 Electricity flowing through conductors
² Conductors
through
Materials that allow a current of electrons to
pass easily
it are known as
conductors. All metals conduct electricity
easily. All metals such as copper, aluminum
and iron are electric conductors. The
electrons in the outermost shell of metallic
atoms can be easily detached from the atom.
A large number of such detached electrons
from the outermost shell of metal atoms are
in random motion in the regions between
metal atoms as shown in Figure 19.5. These
electrons are known as free electrons
Free electrons
Metallic ions
Figure 19.5 – Free existence of electrons
in the outermost shell of metallic atoms
Figure 19.6 – Free electrons in a metal
The reason for electricity to flow easily through metals is the existence of free
electrons. Let us consider the process that takes place when the ends of such a
metallic conductor is connected to a dry cell as shown in Figure 19.7.

The negative terminal of a cell has the ability to repel electrons. Its positive terminal
has the ability to attract electrons. Therefore, whenever the positive and negative
143
For free distribution
terminals of a cell are connected by a conductor, electrons begin to flow from the
negative terminal of the cell to the positive terminal via the conductor. This flow of
electrons is possible because of the presence of free electrons in metals. That is, the
free electrons that are in random motion in a metal begin to move from the negative
terminal of the cell to the positive terminal along the same direction as a result of
connecting the electric cell.
The actual flow of electrons takes place from the negative to the positive terminals
of the cell via the conductor. However, conventionally the direction of the electric
current is considered to be in the opposite direction to that of the electron flow.
That is, when an electron current flows from the negative to the positive terminal,
a conventional electric current is said to flow from the positive to the negative
terminal. The directions of the electric current flow and the electron flow are
illustrated in Figures 19.8 and 19.9.

Exercise 19.1
Mark the currents flowing through the circuits given below by arrow heads.
19.3 Potential difference and the electromotive force
It is a well-known fact that the speed of water flow through pipe lines is larger for
water tanks positioned at higher locations. The reason for the higher flow speeds
with higher positions of the tank is the larger pressure difference between the water
tank and the place where the water is utilized.
The current flowing in an electric circuit is analogous to the water flow from a
water tank. Here, the source of electricity acts like the water tank and the pressure
difference between the two ends of a water carrying tube corresponds to the electric
pressure difference arising due to the electrons being pushed by the negative
terminal of the source of electricity through the conductor.
This electric pressure difference is known as the potential difference. The unit
used to measure the potential difference is the Volt (V). The force by which the
negative terminal of the electric source releases electrons to the external circuit is
known as the electromotive force. (EMF)
The electromotive force of a cell is equal to the potential difference between the
terminals of the cell when electricity is not drawn from the cell.
When an electric current is drawn from a cell, the current also passes through the
cell itself. The cell too has an electric resistance. Then a potential difference arises
across the resistance of the cell. When this potential difference is subtracted from
the electromotive force of the cell, the potential difference that provides an electric
current to the external circuit can be obtained.

Since the potential difference between two points in a circuit is measured in Volts,
it is also known as the voltage.
Figure 19'12 - A voltmeter
The instrument used to measure the voltage is the voltmeter. In order to measure

voltmeter should be connected across the two points as shown in the figure 19.13.

the voltage across the bulb. The ammeter is connected to the circuit to
measure the current passing through the bulb. Figure 19.14 (b) shows the
circuit diagrams corresponding to the above three possible connections.

In the first instance, the positive terminals of the two cells are connected to the two
terminals of the bulb. Therefore there is no potential difference across the bulb. As
there is no potential difference, there won’t be a current flow through the bulb. This
will be evident from your observations.
In the second connection, the negative terminals of the two cells are connected to the
terminals of the bulb. Here also there does not exist a potential difference across the
battery and there won’t be a current flow through the bulb.
In the third connection, the positive terminal of one cell and the negative terminal of
other cell are connected to the terminals of the bulb. Here, there will be a potential
difference across the bulb and a current flow through the bulb only in the third
connection.
From this activity we can conclude that in order for a current to flow through a
conductor, it is necessary for a potential difference to exist across it.
19.4 Relationship between the current flowing through
a conductor and the potential difference across the
conductor
When a potential difference is applied across a conductor, a current flows through it.
Let us now investigate whether there is a relationship between the current passing
through a conductor and the potential difference across the conductor.

² Close the switch (s) and quickly obtain the readings of the voltmeter and the
ammeter and turn off the switch. The reason for quickly turning off the switch
is to prevent the temperature of the nichrome coil from rising. It is essential
to maintain a constant temperature throughout the activity.
² After sometime adjust the rheostat, close the switch and take another set of
readings.
² Repeat the above steps to take at least five sets of readings.

Find the ratio Voltage (V)/Current (I) for each data set. You will observe a constant
value for the above ratio if the temperature of the coil was maintained at a constant
value.
This relationship was first discovered by the German scientist George Simon Ohm.
This law is known as Ohm’s law.
Ohm’s Law
When the temperature of a conductor remains constant,
the current (I) passing through the conductor is directly
proportional to the potential difference (V) across it.
That is, at constant temperature, I ∝ V
Therefore, V/I= constant
This constant is known as the electrical resistance of the
conductor.
The unit for measuring the resistance is the Ohm (Ω).

The unit for measuring the resistance is the Ohm (Ω).
If a current of one Ampere (1A) passes through a conductor for a potential difference
of one Volt (1V) across it, then its resistance is defined to be one Ohm (1Ω).
Ohm’s law can be expressed in the form of an equation as V=IR, where V is the
potential difference, I is the current and R is the resistance.
The instrument used to measure the resistance is known as the Ohm meter.

19.5 Factors affecting the resistance of a conductor
The resistance of a segment of a conductor depends on the following factors.
(i) Area of cross section of the segment of conductor
(ii) Length of the segment of conductor
(iii) Material composition of the conductor
Let us do Activity 4 in order to investigate the influence of each of the above factors
on resistance.

(c) What can you say from the readings for the wires 5, 6 and 7?
According to Activity 4, it will be clear that the current flowing in each of the above
instances are different. The reason for this is the differences in the resistances in
each instance. According to this activity, three main factors that affect the resistance
of a conductor can be stated.
That is"
(i) Area of cross-section of the conductor
(ii) Length of the conductor
(iii) Material of the conductor.
How each of them affects the resistance is mentioned below.
• The resistance decreases when the cross-sectional area is increased.
• The resistance increases when the length is increased.
• For wires having the same length and cross-sectional areas but made of different
metals, the currents flowing for the same potential difference are different. The
reason for this is the difference in the factor known as the “resistivity” which
depends on the material.
19.6 Resistors
In order to control the water flow through a tube, a tap can be used. What is done
here is the use of an obstacle to control the water flow. The electric current flowing
through a conductor can also be controlled in a similar manner. You may have
already understood what could be done in the case of a conductor. By increasing
the resistance of a circuit, the current flow through the circuit can be decreased. In
order to change the resistance of a circuit, many circuit components with various

resistances that could be connected to the circuit have been found. They are known
as resistors.

of resistance.
Types of resistors
Various types of resistors with various values for the resistances have been invented.
Let us consider a few such varieties.
1. Fixed value resistors
2. Variable resistors
3. Light dependent resistors
• Fixed value resistors
By depositing thin films of carbon on
insulators or by winding a material with a
high resistance materials like nichrome,
resistors having various values for the
resistance are fabricated. Their resistances
cannot be changed.

The value assigned to each color is given in Table 19.1. In order to find the coded
value of resistor, the number given by the first two color bands should be multiplied
by a power of ten. The power which ten should be raised to (index of the tenth
power) is given by the value of the third band. The index of this value is given in
column 1 of Table 19.1. In addition to this, the indices corresponding to gold and
silver are -1 and -2 respectively. That is, in order to represent the resistor values
for decimal valued resistances, gold and silver bands are used. The fourth band
marked apart from the other three indicates the range that the resistor value can
vary (tolerance interval). Table 19.2 shows the values assigned to the tolerance
color codes.

● Variable resistors
Resistors fabricated so as to allow a variation in the resistance as desired are known
as variable resistors. The resistor value can be varied manually or turning using
a screw in an by appropriate direction. There are many types of variable resistors
such as pre adjustment resistors, rheostats and volume control resistors.
Figure 19.27 (a) shows several variable resistors and Figure 19.27 (b) shows
symbols used for variable resistors.

Variable resistors are used to control the volume of radios, to adjust electronic
circuits and to vary currents in laboratory experiments.
● Light Dependent Resistors
Light dependent resistors (LDR) are fabricated using chemicals such as cadmium
sulfide. Value of the resistance depends on the intensity of light.
In the dark when the light intensity is low, these resistors have a high resistance. In
the presence of light, their resistance decreases. Light dependent resistors are used
in control circuits of instruments that need to operate based on the amount of light
falling on them.

19.7 Combination of resistors
Resistors are used to control the current passing through a circuit as desired. When
it is difficult to find a resistor with the required resistance, it is possible to use many
resistors to obtain the required value. There are two basic methods of combining
resistors.
1. Series combination of resistors
2. Parallel combination of resistors
Series combination of resistors
When the resistors are connected in such a way that the same current flows through
each of the resistors as shown in Figure 19.29, it is known as a series combination
of resistors. Figure 19.29 shows three resistors R1, R2 and R3 connected in a series
combination.

Figure 19.29 – A series combination of resistors in a circuit
If the current passing through the circuit is I, using V=IR,
Potential difference across the resistor V1 = I. R1
Potential difference across the resistor V2 = I. R2
Potential difference across the resistor V3 = I. R3
161
For free distribution
When resistors are connected in series, the sum of the potential differences across
the resistors is equal to the supply voltage difference.
Therefore,
V = IR = I.R1 + I.R2 + I.R3
R = R1+ R2+ R3 where R is the equivalent resistance.
The equivalent resistance is the resistance of a single resister that could be used
in place of all three resistors. In a series combination of resistors, the equivalent
resistance is equal to the sum of all the resistors.
Example 1
The figure shows a 10 Ω resistor and a 2 Ω resistor connected to a 6 V power supply.

= 10 Ω + 2 Ω
= 12 Ω
(ii) Apply V= IR in order to find the current passing through the circuit.

Parallel combination of resistors
A combination of resistors in which the total current is divided among the resistors
as shown in Figure 19.30 is known as a parallel combination of resistors.

In this circuit, the total current is divided among each of the resistors. That is, the
total current in the circuit is the sum of the currents passing through each of the
constituent resistors.
I = I1+I2+I3
Substituting for I in terms of V and R according to Ohm’s law,

Electric Shock
Electric shock occurs when the human body becomes part of a path through which
electrons can flow. A complete Circuit and a voltage difference are necessary for
current to flow.
Figure 19.31
Without two contact points on the body for
current to enter and exit, there is no hazard of
shock. These two points should also be of
different voltages. This is why birds can
safely rest on high-voltage power lines
without getting shocked: they make contact
with the circuit but the two points they touch
have the same voltage.
This might lend one to believe that it's
impossible to be shocked by electricity by
only touching a single wire. Like the birds.
Unfortunately, this is not correct. Unlike
birds. people are usually standing on the
ground when they contact a "live" wire. One
side of a power system will be intentionally
connected to earth ground, and so the preson
touching a single wire is actually making
contact between two points in the circuit the
wire earth ground.
Figure 19.32
Ohm's Law and Electrical Safety
"It's not voltage that kills, its current!'' is a common phrase heard in reference
to electrical safety. While there is an element of truth to this,there's more to
understand about shock hazards than this simple adage.If voltage presented no
danger, why do they display signs saying: DANGER -- HIGH VOLTAGE !?
The principle that " current kills" is essentially correct. However, electric current
doesn't just occur on its own, there must be voltage available to motivate electrons
166
For free distribution
to flow through a victim. A person's body also presents resistance to current,
which must be taken into account. Taking ohm's Law for voltage, current,and
resistance, and expressing it in terms of current for a given voltage and resistance,
we have this equation:
I =
V
R
Current =
Voltage
resistance
The amount of current through a body is equal to the amount of voltage applied
between two points on that body, divided by the electrical resistance offered by the
body between those two points. Obviously, more the voltage difference between
the two points, easier the current flow through any given amount of resistance.
Hence, high voltage implies high potential for a large amount of current to flow
through your body, which will injure or kill you.
Conversely, the more resistance a body offers to current, slower the electron flow
for any given amount of voltage. just how much voltage is dangerous depends on
how much total resistance is in the circuit to oppose the flow of electrons.
Body resistance is not a fixed quantity. It varies from person to person and from
time to time. There are so many variables in the human body affecting body
resistance. It varies depending on how contact is made with the skin: is it from
hand-to-hand, hand-to-foot, foot-to-foot, hand-to-elbow, etc.

Summary
• By rubbing certain materials on one another, electrons are exchanged
between them.
• An electric current is a flow of electric charges.
• The direction of the conventional current is from the positive terminal to
the negative terminal.
• The potential difference between the two terminals of a cell when a current
is not passing through it is known as the electromotive force of the cell.
• Ohm’s law states that the current passing through a conductor is proportional
to the potential difference across it when the temperature of the conductor
is constant.
• The property that obstructs the flow of current through a circuit is its
electrical resistance.

Inheritance
20.1 Diversity among organisms

Biology

You know that there are large numbers of plant and animal species in the biosphere.
One species can be identified separately from another species by observing their
external features. We get this ability as these species possess inherited features.
Inherited characters are the features that transmit from generation to generation.
Although there are common characteristics for a species all the organisms belong
to a single species are not similar.
y The body features of every human is not similar. There are many differences
among them (Fig - 20.1).

According to the observation of the above activity it is revealed that most of the
mother’s and father’s characteristics have passed to the next generations. But you
may have found new characteristics in your brother, sister or any other relative
which is not found in any relative. If you further study previous generations you
may find that particular characteristic in them. It is clear that inherited characteristics
may pass evading from one generation to the next.

seeds, tall/short plants).
Naturally self pollinating. When necessary, cross pollination is also possible
Ability to obtain offsprings by breeding and can continue the generations
He observed 7 contrasting characters and tested one character at a time
The procedure he followed for the tall and short character was as follows,
 Cultivation of pure breeding tall and short plants. These parental generation
was known as P
 Pollens of tall plants were deposited on stigma of short plants, and vice versa
 Obtain new seeds by cross-pollination and plant them to obtain the next
generation. All plants were tall and they are referred to as F1 generation
 Allow self-pollination to take place within F1 generation
 The resultant seeds were planted to obtain the F2 generation. The tall to short
plant ratio was 3 : 1.
174
For free distribution
It was a question to Mendel that, what has happened to short character in F1
generation. According to Mendel’s opinion, the tall character was dominant and
short was recessive.
The feature which was recessive in F1 generation reappear in F2 generation. It was
an important observation. As Mendel used a single pair of contrasting characters
at a time, it was known as Monohybrid cross.

It is clear that all above characters, are inherited in the same manner. One feature
is completely hidden in F1 generation and it reappears in F2 generation. This is the
recessive feature. In both generations all the plants were with the features of P
generation. No pea plants were with intermediate characters. Mendel assumed that
it was because two different factors determine a single characteristic. In genetics,
symbols are used to denote those factors. The standard is that the dominant factor
is denoted by a capital letter and the recessive by a simple letter.

When any two different objects combine randomly, the result will take place

randomly. Carryout below activity to identify the probability
(Probability means the ability of an incident to happen.)
Do you know ?
The probability of getting the head or the tail when tossing a coin is 1/2
The bead experiment is similar to relationships of probabilities using
two coins at a time. To find out Head – Head, Head – Tail, Tail – Head,
Tail – Tail probabilities, the probabilities obtained from each coin has to
be multiplied.
Then the probability is 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/4
When the same incident takes place in two ways (Eg. getting Head – Tail
and Tail – Head) is the total of separately taken probabilities.
That is 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2

20.3 Basic concepts of genetics
y Gene concepts about inheritance
Mendel said that the features of an organism is determined by a special particular
factors. The identified particular factor is named as genes later.
In gene concept, as a standard the dominant feature is denoted by a capital letter
and the recessive by a simple letter. We have already used these letters in Mendel
monohybrid cross.
If two genes are similar for a given feature of an organism, it is said that this organism
is homozygous for that feature, or else that organism possesses homozygous genes.
If two genes are not similar then that organism is heterozygous, or else that
organism possesses heterozygous genes.

Gene for round seed is R, Gene for wrinkled seed is r

The phenotype of round seed homozygote is round. The genotype is RR

• Nature of genetic material & genes
Scientists have identified that the Deoxy ribo Nucleic Acid (DNA) present in
chromosomes acts as the genetic material that transmits features of organisms from
generation to generation.
The double helical structure of DNA was first discovered by two scientists named
Watson and Crick in 1953.
According to the sequence of base pairs in DNA strand, different genetic information
are stored.
The features of organisms are determined by the sequence of base pairs. Accordingly
a gene is a specific base sequence in a DNA molecule responsible for a particular
character. In other way, gene is a specific segment of DNA for a particular character.
The genes that determine large number of features in an organism and transmit
them from generation to the next are present in chromosomes. Each gene has a
particular location in a chromosome.

• Gene linkage
A pair of chromosomes that are arranged to the same sequence of characters are
known as homologous chromosomes. They are same in length, width and the
location of centromere. An organism receives this homologous chromosomes from
its parents, one from mother and the other from father. A pair of genes that determine
a particular character are present in complementary locations of homologous
chromosomes. It is clear in Mendel’s experiment that during gamete formation,
these genes, independently segregate.
A scientist called Morgan also did experiments about genetics. He got unexpected
phenotypic ratios, and found out that, the genes do not segregate always
independently. The genes that present in the same chromosome which are not
segregated independently are known as linked genes. Morgon discovered the gene
linkage.

Transmission of inherited characters to next generation is known as heredity. The
process by which those characters transmit is known as inheritance. You have
already learnt that the characters of organisms pass to the next generations by the
genes of chromosomes. The behaviour of genes & chromosomes during inheritance
has mentioned above in gene linkage & meiosis.
The behaviour of chromosomes during sex determination of human is discussed
under inheritance.
Even though the chromosomes in a nucleus of a cell are different in shape & size,
the number of them is constant for a species. It is a unique feature of a species.
Below are the number of chromosomes present in nuclei of different organisms.

20.5 Sex determination of human
You may prefer to know how your gender is determined. This incidence is known
as sex determination. We will look at how the sex is determined.
There are 46 chromosomes, or 23 pairs of chromosomes, in a human cell. Out of
those 23 pairs, 22 pairs are autosomal chromosomes and the remaining pair is the
sex chromosomes.

Figure 20.21 - 22 pairs of Autosomal chromosomes
and sex chromosome pair of a male
Two sex chromosomes of a female are similar in structure and shape. They are
known as X chromosomes. The sex chromosomes of a male are different from each
other. They are known as X and Y chromosomes. The Y chromosome is smaller
than X. The X chromosome of males is similar to the X chromosome of females.
During formation of an egg from an egg mother cell and sperms from sperm
mother cell the pair of sex chromosomes separate. A sperm contains 22 autosomal
chromosomes and only a single sex chromosome. An egg possesses only a X
chromosome and a sperm contains a X or a Y chromosome.
When an egg gets fertilized with a sperm, there may be two X chromosomes or X
and Y chromosomes in the zygote.
A zygote with two X chromosomes produces a girl. X and Y chromosome produces
a boy. Accordingly the factor that needs to determine a boy is received from the
father and not the mother. The sex determination is shown in the diagram 20.23.
The probability of getting a girl or a boy is 50% .

Genetic disorders due to sex linked inheritance
Even though X and Y chromosomes determine the human sex, all the genes present
on those sex chromosomes, are not used in determination of sex. Most of the genes
on X and Y chromosomes, determine other features as autosomal chromosomes. As
Y chromosome is shorter than X chromosome, most of the genes complementary
for X are absent in Y. Accordingly, in males for most of the X linked genes, there
are no complementary genes in Y.
184
For free distribution
Therefore most of the genes in X, whether they are dominant or recessive, they are
phenotypically expressed in males. But as females possess a pair of X chromosomes,
X linked genes are paired. They phenotypically express a recessive character only
when they are present as double recessive genes. We will consider several genetic
disorders, occur due to sex linked recessive genes.

Figure 20.24 - Inheritance of Haemophilia
Haemophilia which occurs due to a X linked recessive gene only present in males
in the population. When a wound or cut occurs, it is essential to clot blood. At that
time when a blood clot is formed, it stops excessive bleeding.
Haemophilic patient's, blood does not clot. Therefore they die because of bleeding.
Females act as carriers for this disease.
y Colour blindness (Red – Green colour blindness)
This is the most common sex linked inherited disease. The reason for this disease
is, a recessive gene in X chromosome. The sufferer cannot distinguish red colour
from green colour. This is common among males rarely occur in females. When a
colour blind female is married to a healthy male the inheritance of colour blindness
is as in the below diagram.
The chance to show the sex linked inherited diseases in females is low, the chance
of getting those diseases in female children is high if they are married to blood
relatives. The reason for that is the female that joined the family is most probably
a carrier.

Gene mutations & related inherited disorders
Due to a change in DNA of a chromosome, the mutations occur in a single gene, are
known as gene mutation. When a naturally active gene is mutated, it gets inherited,
we will look at few genetic disorders that occur due to a mutated gene.
Do you know ?
Occurence of gene mutations takes place due to several
reasons. They are
y
y
y
Spontaneous without any external effects
Due to chemicals
Due to radiations
y Albinism
Natural complexion is due to a pigment called Melanin. This disorder occurred
due to a mutation of the gene which is responsible for the production of the above
pigment present in an autosomal chromosome.
The features of this disorder are the abnormal white colour of skin, hair and eye
lashes. Albinism occurs when gene is present as recessive homozygous condition.
Not only human but also animals become albino. (Fig - 20.26)

y Thalassemia
This is a condition that occurs due to a mutation in a gene responsible for the
production of haemoglobin. Haemoglobin is a protein that acts as a carrier for O2
transportation in blood. Due to reduction of haemoglobin production in thalassemic
patients, the main symptom is anaemia. Homozygous recessive tt, condition is
diseased. Heterozygous Tt condition is the carrier. There are several areas in Sri
Lanka with higher number of thalassemic patients. The reason for that may be the
marriages between blood relatives.

• Application of knowledge of inheritance
Since long time man has understood that by selecting animals and plants with better
qualities, can produce quality hybrid plants and animal varieties. Cows that can
produce higher volume of milk, hens that produce large number of eggs, chicken
with higher growth rate, crops with high yield or pest resistant, fleshy seedless
fruits (Fig-20.27) are examples of genetic applications to improve quality of animal
or plant products.

When principles of genetics were identified, production of hybrid plants and
animals becomes a technology. It was first applied among some wheat cultivators in
America. The economy was developed as they have used improved wheat varieties.
Now in Sri Lanka, crop research centres and breeding centres have achieved a
considerable development in gene technology.
Large sized fruits or vegetables, improved grains and livestock have been used
fulfilling the needs of the greatly increasing population. If we have not used
genetically modified high quality products, we would not be able to fulfill the high
demand of food.

20.7 Genetic engineering
New technology is being used to produce a recombinant DNA molecule, which is
formed by combining DNA fragments of different sources. This field is known as
Recombinant DNA technology.
This field is highly popularized as genetic engineering or gene technology.
The genotype of an organism can be altered by removing or adding extra DNA
fragments into genome.
We will look at the application of gene technology in food and agriculture, medical
and industrial fields.

Summary
• The diversity among organisms in the biosphere is because of the
inherited features of each species.
•
Inherited features are the characters that transmit from generation to
generation.
• Within the same species too the organisms possess differences.
• There are common and rare inherited characters in human populations.
• The field that study about the way that the inherited characters are
transmitted is known as genetics.
• Gregor Mendel was the first person to carryout experiments regarding
inherited characters of plants.
• Mendel concluded that two factors, different to each other which are
responsible for determining, a character of the pea plant.
• These factors that determine characters, later identified as genes. One of
these is a dominant gene and the other is a recessive gene.
• The pattern of inheritance of a monohybrid cross can be expressed in a
chart.
• The pair of genes, responsible for a particular feature can be shown in a
gene expression.
• The externally expressed feature of an organism is phenotype.
• The gene composition that determines a particular phenotype is the
genotype.
• The material that transmits features from generation to generation is the
DNA in chromosomes.
• A specific nitrogenous base sequence of DNA is known as a gene.
• The number of chromosomes in nucleus is constant for a species.
• The pair of chromosomes that are similar in length, width and location of
centromere is known as the homologous chromosome.
• The pair of genes responsible for a particular character present in
complementary locations of the homologous chromosomes.
