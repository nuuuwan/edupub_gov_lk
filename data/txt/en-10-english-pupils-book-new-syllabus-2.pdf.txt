: Hi, what are you going to draw?
: I am going to draw a monorail.
: What is a monorail?
: Can't you guess? Mono means single…
: Ah! Got it. A train that travels along a single rail.
: I will draw a tram....
: What is that?
: I’ve seen one. Let me explain it to you. It’s a vehicle that runs on
electricity.
: Really?
: Yes, and they run on rails that are built on roads.
: Does that mean that trams run on the road with other vehicles
like buses and cars ?
: Yes, you're right.
: That's exciting. Shakthi, I am sure that you will be an automobile
engineer one day.
: Yes, it’s my ambition. What will you draw, Sethun?
: I will draw a picture of the Wright brothers and a modern
aeroplane.
: That’s great! I will draw a space shuttle.
: Once I travelled in a space shuttle.
: Ah, when did you go to space?

Happy Wanderer
I love to go a-wandering,
Along the mountain track,
And as I go, I love to sing,
My knapsack on my back.
Chorus:
Val-deri,Val-dera
Val-deri,
Val-dera-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Val-deri,Val-dera.
My knapsack on my back.
I love to wander by the stream
That dances in the sun,
So joyously it calls to me,
"Come! Join my happy song!"
Chorus:
I wave my hat to all I meet,
And they wave back to me,
And blackbirds call so loud and sweet
From ev'ry green wood tree.
Chorus:
High overhead, the skylarks wing,
They never rest at home
But just like me, they love to sing,
As o'er the world we roam.
Chorus:
Oh, may I go a-wandering
Until the day I die!
Oh, may I always laugh and sing,
Beneath God's clear blue sky!

Activity 08
Read the following article and answer the questions given below.
The wheel has been an essential part of human
life from the very early years of human civilisation.
The wheel can be best described as a circular object
that rotates on an axial bearing. The earliest wheels
were known to be wooden disks with a hole in the
middle for the axle. The word wheel first came from
an Old English word. In Sanskrit, the wheel is called
chakra to mean round or circle. It is believed that the
wheel first originated around 3500 BC in Mesopotamia (part of modern -day
Iraq) where it was used for chariots. Some argue that it was invented by the
Mesopotamians, the Northern Caucasus and Central Europeans. Therefore, the
issue of where the wheel originated in still remains a mystery.
The next step in the evolution of the wheel was made by the Egyptians 1500
years later in 2000 BC when they used spokes in their wheels and proudly used
them in their chariots while the Greeks have the honour of introducing the cross
bar or the H-type wheel.
The other significant developments in the evolution of the wheel includes the
introduction of wire tension spoke in 1802 when G. F. Bauer obtained a patent
for it and the introduction of a new type of tire in 1845 by R.W. Thompson
which was improved later by John Dunlop in 1888.
The wheel was one of the central technologies which boosted the industrial
revolution. The invention of the wheel has contributed immensely to the
development of technology and the most significant being the water wheel,
the cog wheel and the spinning wheel. Some of the latest developments of the
wheel include the propeller, the jet engine and flywheel and the turbine.
The wheel which originated so long ago has passed through many stages of
development and change and is now presented in very attractive forms. Today,
one cannot even imagine any mechanism without a wheel, can you?

An Unforgettable Trip
The trip we made to Kataragama during my school holidays was an unforgettable
one. We left home early in the morning and reached Kataragama by the evening.
Everybody got out of the van and began to unload the baggage. My uncle got
on to the roof of the van and began to untie the rope so that they could unload
the pots and pans. We took our bags into the room to unpack our clothes. My
mother and aunt went to the kitchen to prepare dinner. After a few minutes I
heard them laughing loudly. They seemed to be enjoying the cooking. As we
were sleepy and tired we had our dinner and went to bed early.
The following morning, we woke up early and had a bath in the beautiful Menik
Ganga. Next, we went to the Kiri Vehera and the Kataragama Kovil. We waited
patiently in line at the Kovil to offer a basket of fruits to the Kataragama Deity.
We spent the rest of the day walking around the historic city of Kataragama.
I was very unhappy to see a lot of garbage left carelessly all around the city.
I wish that people were more thoughtful of the environment and were more
careful when they throw garbage. We all came back to the guest house later in
the evening and packed our bags quickly to go back home.
