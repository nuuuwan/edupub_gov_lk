Let us have nutritious food for
healthy living
In order to lead a healthy life, it is important that we consume nutritious food. These
nutrients are needed for growth, repair of worn out tissues, protection from illnesses
and to provide energy needed for different functions of the body. Nutritional
problems arise when we don’t get the proper dietary requirements. Therefore food
intake plays a major role in leading a healthy life.
In the previous classes we learnt about the nutrients in the diet, preparing a well-
balanced diet using the food pyramid, changes in food intake at different stages of
life, food spoilage and preservation and different beliefs about food.
Being the future of the country, you can help to minimize the nutritional problems
in the society. Improving our knowledge on nutrition, will help to develop good
food habits, help to prepare menus to suit different needs. This lesson, will help us
learn about common nutritional problems, their effects, and ways to minimize these
problems.
The importance of nutritious food
A good physical, mental, social, and spiritual well-being results in a healthy person.
If a person has a poor nutrition the following symptoms can occur.
1. Reduced energy
2. Mental unfitness
3. Poor immunity
4. Long term illnesses
5. Poor health
The working capacity of a person with a poor nutrional condition will be lower
than a person with a good nutritional condition due to the above reasons. This has a
negative effect on the personal life and in general the economy of the country. When
children are affected by nutritional problems, it affects their education, capacity to
think, growth and personality. It adversely affects the individual, the family and the
nation as a whole.
Nutrients in Food
The nutrients in food are divided into two main components, macronutrients and
micronutrients.
Macronutrients and micronutrients
Macronutrients
Nutrients in the diet that are required in large amounts are called macronutrients.
Carbohydrate, protein and fat are considered as macronutrients.
Micronutrients
Nutrients in the diet that are required in small quantities are called micronutrients.
Vitamins and minerals are micronutrients. They are needed to protect the body.
The nutritional problems in Sri Lanka
Malnutrition
Malnutrition occurs due to lack of proper nutrition as well as excessive consumption
of nutrients.
There are two types of malnutrition:
1. Undernutrition
2. Overnutrition
1. Undernutrition
The common nutritional problem that developing countries face is undernutrition.
Undernutrition results when the required amount of macronutrients are not taken
in the diet. Any person of any age can develop undernutrition. However all over the
world the main victims are children. The adverse effects of undernutrition, could
have long term effects at different stages of life.
Different effects of undernutrition are given below:
1. Stunting (inadequate height for the age) - height being below -2 SD
line in height for age chart
2. Wasting (inappropriate weight for the height) - BMI below -2 SD line in
We have learned about these assessments in detail in chapter one.
BMI for age chart
The problem of undernutrition arises as a result of lack of required nutrients to the
body. This could occur due to the lack of the essential nutrients during a short or
over a long period of time e.g: Diseases such as diarrhoea or worm infestations
can lead to temporary weight loss leading to wasting.
Harmful effects of undernutrition:
1. Inactivity and being less productive
2. Retarded physical growth
3. prone to diseases
4. Being poor concentration and memory power
5. Learning difficulties
6. Low life expectancy
7. Under nourished females give birth to low birth weight babies and there could be
an increase in infant death rates.
2. Overnutrition
Over nutrition has become a major nutritional problem all over the world. Overutrition
results when excess amounts of macronutrients are consumed. Especially excess
intake of sugar and fat in our diet is the main reason for overnutrition. The following
are two examples of overnutrition.
1. Overweight
- weight not proportionate to height. This has the risk of
developing obesity ( BMI between +1SD to +2SD line
in BMI for age chart )
2. Obesity
- inappropriately high levels of weight to the height. This
is a disease state.( BMI above +2SD line in BMI for age
chart)
The BMI is also used to assess an adult’s nutritional status. In the first chapter we
learnt how to assess the nutrional status of adults using the BMI.
Obesity can lead to the following problems:
1. Prone to non-communicable diseases such as heart disease, diabetes and stroke
2. Diseases related to joints and bones
3. Reduced efficiency at work
4. Social problems
5. Psychological issues
Activity
Make a list of food items that are suitable to be taken and items that should be
limited by an overweight or obese person.
Micronutrient Deficiency
Lack of micronutrients in our daily food intake, over a long period results in micro
nutritional deficiency. The most common micronutritional deficiencies are given
below.
1. Iron deficiency
2. Iodine deficiency
3. Vitamin A deficiency
4. Calcium deficiency
5. Zinc deficiency

Zinc deficiency
Zinc is an important mineral as it strengthen the immune system, helps carbohydrate
breakdown and stimulate growth, division and reproduction of cells. Zinc deficiency
can lead to frequent infections, delayed or stunted growth etc.
Zinc is found in protien rich foods such as beans, red meat, peanuts and marine
foods.
Steps to be taken to prevent nutritional problems.
1. Pregnant mothers to be made aware of the importance of breast feeding
during the first few days, to ensure that the baby gets colostrum which is
rich in vitamin A.
2. Exclusively breast feeding babies during the first 6 months as it provides all the
necessary nutrients for physical and mental development.
3. Having a well-balanced healthy diet.
4. Having meals at regular times and not skipping breakfast.
5. Get used to the habit of taking natural food and reduce the intake of fat, sugar
and instant food. Five portions of vegetable and fruits should be included in
the daily diet.
6. Being mindful that food advertised does not contain the nutrients it is claimed
to have.
7. Engage in daily physical exercise and spend the day actively.
8. Daily intake of water of a healthy person should be 1 ½ to 2 liters. Whenever
you feel thirsty drink clean water.
9. Large portions of seasonal food to be consumed during the season (Mango,
Rambutan).
10. Consume food to fulfill the daily requirement of calories.
The vicious cycle of nutritional deficiency
The vicious cycle of nutritional deficiency has become a great threat to any
developing country. When the mother has undernutrition, naturally the baby born
will be underweight. When that child enters teenage years he/she will have poor
growth which results in stunting and wasting. As a result of this when a girl enters
motherhood she will develop nutritional deficiencies and her baby too will suffer
from nutritional deficiencies. This cycle is called the vicious cycle of nutritional
deficiency. In order to create a healthy nation this vicious cycle should be broken at
some point and the best stage to do this is during the adolescence.
Therefore improving the nutrition of a girl during childhood and adolescence will
result in her being healthy during motherhood as well.
So, we can understand an infant’s nutritional status has an impact when she becomes
an adolescent and will affect the baby she will give birth to one day.
The reasons for poor weight gain during pregnancy
1. Maternal undernutrition
2. Inadequate nutrient intake during pregnancy
3. Illnesses developed during pregnancy (diabetes,anaemia, high blood pressure)
4. Not receiving proper nutrition during childhood and adolescence.
The reasons mentioned above will result in a baby with a low birth weight. If a
baby’s weight is below 2.5kg, it is considered as a low birth weight.
A baby with a low birth weight will have delays in physical, mental and social
development. This situation can be overcome by giving proper care and nutritious
food to the child. If this level of care is not provided to the child she will be
prone to frequent infections, and will have retarded physical development during
childhood and adolescence. The child could become stunted, wasted and her
mental development will also be affected resulting in poor school performance.
The vicious cycle of nutritional deficiency continues.
Similarly addressing these nutritional issues in the life course of a boy, will help to
have a more productive and active healthy nation.

Make a chart showing the interventions that can be done to break the vicious cycle
of nutritional deficiency.
Factors affecting nutritional deficiency
1. Food hygiene
‘‘Food hygiene’’ refers to the cleanliness in the preparation and consumption of
food in such manner as to prevent disease and that doesn’t develop any harmful
effects to the health of an individual.
There are three factors that affect the safety of the food:
i. Biological factors - food contaminated with microorganisms
ii. Chemical factors - food contaminated with other chemicals
iii. Physical factors
- common types of foreign matters - e.g: sand, stones etc.
Food spoilage is the loss of the quality of food due to different factors, such as:
i. Flies, cockroaches, rats and birds feeding on the food
ii. During preparation having unclean hands, unclean utensils and improper
cooking methods.
iii. Improper food usage
iv. Adopting improper storing methods
By using proper methods, food spoilage can be prevented. The following points
will help to minimize food spoilage:
i. Washing hands before touching food
ii. Preparing food hygienically
iii. Using clean spoons and utensils to serve food
iv. Person preparing food to maintain a high level of personal hygiene
v. Avoiding food poisoning
• Avoid taking food contaminated by fungi - some fungi produce a poisonous
chemical called Aflatoxin
• Avoid taking potatoes with green coloured skin - when potatoes are exposed to
the sun light a poison named solanine develops on it which is harmful to health.
• Avoid using metal containers to store pickles –Acetic acid in vinegar reacts
with the metal ( aluminum or iron).
• Avoid reusing oil for deep frying - as it results in producing unfavourable
chemicals.
• Do not use expired food, food with no labels or torn labels, food in cans with
altered shapes (indented or puffed up tins.)
• Do not consume food with an altered taste or smell.
2. Age
Our nutritional needs change with the stages in life. The nutrition in the first 1000
days of a baby’s life, is very important in determining the entire future health of the
individual. Breast milk is a complete food for the infant, as it is very rich in nutrients
and other factors important for the growth, brain development and protection from
infections. Due to nutritional deficiencies a girl faces during adolescence, there will
be a tendency for her to give birth to a low birth weight baby. As we grow older
we do less physical activities, so our diet should contain lesser amount of energy
providing food. As we grow old, the micronutrients such as vitamin B12, vitamin
C, riboflavin, folic acid, calcium and iron in our body become less. It is important
to add more of these micronutrients in the daily diet. Engaging in exercise is very
important as it helps to make our bones stronger. As we grow older increase the
intake of food rich in fiber (fruits and vegetables) and decrease the intake of food
rich in sugar and fat. Maintain a proper body weight in relation to the height (have
a correct BMI value).
3.Health condition
Our food habits should be changed according to diseases we may get. For example
an anaemic patient’s diet should contain food rich in iron and food that potentiate
the absorption of iron. When you are infested with worms in the intestine, although
a nutritious diet is taken, most of it would not be available for absorption by the
person as worms use it. This causes nutritional deficiencies. In order to maintain
a high level of nutrition the diseases should be controlled.
It is very important that all three main meals are taken every day. Skipping breakfast
(specially school going children) leads to undernutrition. Breakfast is very important
because other wise you have to be on an empty stomach for a long time. Skipping
breakfast leads to poor concentration in education.
Fresh fruits and vegetables will help to increase the immunity in the body.
Trans fatty acids are rich in deep fried food, and could be harmful to the body.
The amount of food we take should vary according to the amount of physical
activity or work that we engage in.
4. Environment
A person’s food habits change according to the environment they live in. The
quantity of food changes according to the climate they live in. People who live
in cold countries need more food in order to produce heat to keep the body warm.
5. Misconceptions about food and nutritional problems
There are many wrong beliefs among individual people as well as communities
about selection and preparation of food. Lack of knowledge about nutrition and
being gullible to food advertisements directly contribute to many nutritional
problems seen in the community today.
Some misbeliefs related to nutrition are given below:
i. ‘Cool’ and ‘heaty’ food is bad for the health.
ii. Expensive food items carry more nutritional values.
iii. Soft drinks quench the thirst faster than water.
iv. Milk is considered as a complete food.
v. Believing that digestion is affected during illness therefore reducing the intake
of food.
Some of the other factors that contribute to nutritional deficiencies are financial
situation of individuals, scarcity of food, market forces and lack of knowledge
about the nutritional value of different foods.
Students’ contribution to minimize nutritional problems.
Students can minimize their nutritional problems by knowing their nutritional
status, taking steps to improve the nutritional status, having proper food habits, not
getting misled by advertisements and choosing the correct food. Given below are
some ways that can help directly to improve their nutrition:
1. Development of knowledge related to nutrition
2. Getting used to indigenous food
Developing the competencies relevant to nutrition
1. Varied food habits can be seen in different communities and areas in Sri Lanka.
People have different beliefs on food preparation, consumption, and usage.
Advertisements misguide the public to purchase certain food making them
believe that they are of high nutritional value. Therefore, as students it is your
duty to interpret these advertisements wisely and also possess a knowledge
about the nutritional value of food and to select a well-balanced diet. Students
should pay attention to the amount of food that need to be consumed (not less
or more) and thereby maintaining an appropriate BMI
2. It is very important to take a balanced, healthy diet and to take three main meals
a day. Paying attention to the food pyramid when selecting the amount of food
from each group as necessary per day is important (this was studied in the
previous classes). The knowledge on ‘‘Food plate’’ that you studied in earlier
classes can also be used when selecting different food types for a meal.
3. Children should be aware of the school policies related to nutrition. The food
available at the school canteen should be good for health and students should
select the most suitable and healthy food. Canteen owners must be made aware
of healthy food.
4. Encourage the selection of healthy food for school functions.
Preparing the home garden relative to consumption of food
Figure 7.6
In the past home cultivation of fruits and vegetables was popular in Sri Lanka.
Vegetables, fruits, spices, medicinal and flowering plants were a common sight in
every house.At present due to the nonavailability of sufficient space, the habit of
using artificial food, and lack of time, the concept of home cultivation is slowly
but steadily fading away from us. However, there are many advantages of growing
vegetables and fruits in your own garden. Some benefits are:
1. Fruits and vegetables would be free of poisonous chemicals and be rich in
nutrients.
2. Can prepare a well-balanced diet easily.
3. Get used to the habit of recycling organic waste material.
4. Adds beauty to your surrounding.
5. Spend leisure time productively.
6. Gardening provides the opportunity for physical activity and happiness.
7. Economic benefits (saves money).
Although inadequate space is an obstruction to home cultivation, the Agriculture
Department of Sri Lanka has introduced many alternative methods for home
gardening. Considering the individuals, nutritional needs, availability of space and
time, different methods have been introduced.
1. Growing crops
• Leafy vegetables in pots and drains
• Crops like chillies and tomatoes in pots
• Timber wood trees for the boundary
2. Organic manure
• Compost bins in urban areas and compost pits in other areas
3. Implementing a bio gas unit
4. Collecting rain water and using for gardening.
5. Animal farming

Getting used to indigenous food
Consuming natural food takes a special place in local food habits. Since local food
items can be obtained freshly, their nutrient values would also be high.
Home gardening helps to add local food to your diet and also to go organic. Harmful
chemicals will not get mixed in your food. It is economical too. One way to cut
down your risk of ingesting unwanted chemicals from food is to have your food
from your own garden which would be fresh food.
Garlic, pandan leaves (rampe), karapincha, tamarind, coriander, vinegar are a few
natural flavours that we could add to our daily cooking rather than getting used to
artificial flavours. Natural flavours add taste to the food, gives a nice appearance
and improve the appetite. Spices have medicinal values and a profound effect on
general health.

White
- beet root

Milk and dairy products are available locally. Milk is considered as a high energy
yielding local product. The five products of the cow (“pasgorasa”) is made of cow’s
milk, and it is a combination of five items such as milk, ghee, butter (wendaru),
whey (moru) and curd. These products are nutritious and good for the health.

Food related culture of Sri Lanka
From ancient times, the staple food in Sri Lanka has been rice. There are different
kinds of rice such as ‘Suwandel’, ‘Elsahal’, ‘Heeneti’ etc. Apart from rice, grains
and grain based products are taking a major place in our diet. Kurakkan and meneri
are a few of these. Grains carry a high nutritional value.
Our main meals should be balanced and wholesom. For example we can include
hathmaluwa (curry made with seven vegetables), mung kiribath, mixed green leaves
etc. To have a well-balanced diet many vegetables and green leaves are added.
Steps could be taken to avoid food wastage. There are many ways to preserve food
in Sri Lanka such as making dry fish, jadi, drying jack seeds etc.
Figure 7.10
Sri Lanka has always been a home to a multi ethnic and multi cultural society.
There are certain foods popular among certain communities. Pittu, thosai, wade
are traditional food items of the Tamil community while wattalppan and biriyani
traditional foods of the Muslims.
Figure 7.11
During different festive seasons of different communities their traditional foods
become popular. During the Sinhala and Tamil new year period the traditional
milk rice and sweet meats are prepared. During the Thai Pongal festival the Hindus
cook their customary pongal rice.
Figure 7.12
There are certain types of food prepared on special occasions. Milk rice is a
traditional food item of Sri Lanka made to celebrate special occasions such as
wedding ceremonies, birthdays etc. At different stages of life we come across
situations that are important in our life and on each such occasion the food that
is prepared and served has a special significance. For example the meal which
is partaken by the kith and kin of the dead, is known as “mala batha”, which is a
simple meal of rice served with curries cooked with dry fish and pumpkin. This
type of food traditionally comes from generation to generation, with or without the
knowledge of nutritional value.
Preparations of food according to the needs of different
individuals.
Children
Babies are exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life. During this period
it is strictly advised not to give formula milk and if needed to do so, to be done
only on medical advice. Once the baby completes six months, complementary food
is started. While the child is being given complementary food, breast feeding is
continued till two years of age. Complementary food at the beginning is given in
the form of semi solid food as the baby has not developed teeth. Gradually with
teething the food can be made more solid and by one year the baby can be introduced
to family food.
As children grow up fast and their physical activities also increase, their need for
energy becomes high. So their diet should be rich in carbohydrates and proteins.
They take only a small quantity of food at a time so it should be sufficiently
nutritional. To increase their appetite it is good to make different types of dishes
(include various types of food to have variety).
Adolescent
During adolescence a rapid change in growth occurs. They need increased amounts
of energy and proteins. Foods with plenty of calcium and iron are particularly
important at this age to support bone and muscle growth. At this age if the necessary
nutritional needs are met, bones and organs grow well and one can reach the
maximum height which can be achieved due to genes. By paying special attention
to their diet at this age, one can avoid future ailments such as osteoporosis.
But unfortunately many do not consider the importance of nutrition at this age.
They consume excess amounts of fatty food, fizzy-drinks, sweets and junk food,
which have become a norm in their diets. Instead they should consume more fresh
fruits and vegetables in their daily diets. It is important to make different types of
dishes to improve the palatability.
In the modern society we can see girls controlling their diet, to prevent excess weight
gain. As a result they become very thin and this is not favourable. The growth a girl
receives at this stage of her life is very important for her in the future. During this
age if girls are not provided with proper nutrition, it will affect the health of the next
generation as well. A girl who with a proper growth during adolescence will be able
to produce a healthy baby with a good birth weight.
Pregnant Mothers
During pregnancy, a female needs more nutrients for the growing baby as well as
to develop various tissues of her body. Therefore a higher level of carbohydrate, fat
and protein are essential for the body. A sufficient amount of micronutrients (iron,
iodine, vitamin A) and minerals (calcium, phosphorous) are essential to the body as
it helps in the growth of the body and brain. Taking folic acid from the beginning is
very vital. Taking proper medical advice is important before using any drugs. Some
pregnant mothers experience a loss of appetite, specially during the early months
of pregnancy. They should take extra precautions to add nutritious food to their
diet. As a solution to this, a pregnant mother has to take food in small quantities at
regular intervals.
Lactating Mothers
All the nutritional needs of the first six months of a baby are provided by breast milk.
Therefore a lactating (breast feeding) mother needs more calories daily. Lactating
mothers should take an extra meal other than the normal diet. Iron and calcium
intake should be high during this period. More sprats, milk, fruits and vegetables
should be added. Lactating mothers should take extra fluids too.
Patients
Patients need a diet rich in nutrients as it is essential for the repair of damaged tissues
as well as for the immunity system to fight against infections. It is important to take
a normal diet even when you are sick, as it does not affect digestion of food. It is
suitable to get advice from a doctor or a nutritionist about the dietary requirements
of certain persons. Patients who have problems related to food digestion, are always
advised to start a diet with liquid, gradually move on to semisolids and solids.
Vegetarians
A well planned vegetarian diet should meet all nutritional requirements in order to
avoid nutritional deficiencies. It is important to make sure that your body is getting
enough protein. Grains and vegetables that are rich in proteins should be consumed
more. Green gram, dhal and soya beans are some food that can be included. Red-
rice, mushrooms should also be included with cereals. Since iron and calcium are
poor in vegetables, it is highly recommended to increase the intake of green leaves
(nivithi, mukunuwenna) green gram and food rich in vitamin C which will increase
the absorption of those nutrients.
Animal proteins are high in quality and help children to have the high quantities
required due to the rapid growth of their body. It is important to add meat in your
diet until quantisation 18 years of age as the body is growing. Due to some reason
if you are a vegetarian it is important to pay attention to include mixture of grains
and cereals in your diet to improve the composition of essential amino acids.
Vitamin B12, is provided only through animal food. Therefore it is advisable for
vegetarians to take such nutrients as vitamin supplements based on medical advice.
Sportsmen
An athlete’s diet varies depending on age, sex, metabolic level and the type of sport
they engage in. A suitable diet should be taken before they start their sport event, in
between and at the end. Although plenty of food stuffs are available in the market
today, it is always better to take medical advice on the diet. It is recommended to
increase the intake of food during the sports season and at the same time to reduce
intake during off season.
Taking a complete diet alone does not improve a physical competencies. The
necessary training is also very important.

Summary.
Malnutrition related to macronutrients and micronutrients are common in Sri Lanka.
These nutritional deficiencies affect an individual’s well being as well as the
economy of a country. Malnutrion and its related complications can be prevented
by identifying the factors that cause nutritional deficiencies and implementing
awareness programmes. The attitude and the knowledge of students towards and
about this aspect is very important when considering their contribution towards
solving this problem. Getting fresh fruits and vegetables from your own garden and
getting used to the habit of eating will help to minimize many nutritional problems.
Preparing the family menu according to the needs of the family members and
ignoring food related myths and beliefs will help build a healthy nutritional status.
