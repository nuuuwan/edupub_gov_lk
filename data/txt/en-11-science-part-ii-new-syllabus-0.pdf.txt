Daily weather report transmitted through television channels may be familiar to you.
Do you remember hearing that the lowest temperature was reported from Nuwaraeliya
while the highest temperature was reported from Trincomalee on a particular day?
Can you remember that it is difficult to dry washed clothes on rainy days and that
they dry fast on warm sunny days?
Try to recall the coolness experienced in eating an ice-cream and the warmness felt
in drinking a hot cup of tea.
Figure 9.1
The physical quantity that describes each of the instances above is the temperature.
Temperature can be specified as a fundamental property of any material object. An
ice cube has a very low temperature. Temperature of warm water is higher than the
temperature of cold water.
Our body too has a temperature. Therefore we can say whether the temperature of a
certain object is higher than or lower than the temperature of our body by touching
the object.
Temperature is measure of the mean kinetic energy possessed by the particles
that form an object.

9.1.1 Measuring temperature
Heat
By touching various objects we can get a rough idea about their temperature.
However, since the temperature felt by touching is not so accurate and cannot be
expressed as a numerical value, it is not a suitable method for measuring temperature.
Therefore, the scientists in the past had realized the necessity for constructing a
device for measuring temperature.
² Thermometers
The device employed to measure temperature is known as the thermometer. World’s
first thermometer was invented by Galileo Galilei around 1600 A.D.
Figure 9.2 -Thermometer constructed by
Figure 9.3- Galileo Galilei
Galileo
Various types of thermometers are in use at present. We will only be focusing on
the glass - mercury thermometer and the glass-alcohol thermometer in this chapter.
Glass-mercury Thermometer
The glass – mercury thermometer is constructed by connecting a narrow glass tube
to a bulb containing mercury. When the temperature rises, the mercury in the bulb
expands and moves up along the narrow tube. The temperature can be read from the
scale marked on the tube according to the length of the mercury column.
Although the volume expansion due to a small temperature difference is small, the
length of the mercury column rises up by a clearly visible amount as the diameter of
the narrow tube containing mercury is very small. A glass – mercury thermometer
is shown in Figure 9.4.

Figure 9.4 – A glass-mercury thermometer
Mercury is commonly used in thermometers as it has a uniform expansion over
a broad range of temperatures, is a good thermal conductor and is a liquid over a
broad range of temperatures (from – 39 oC to 357 oC). However, due to the toxicity
of mercury, use of glass-mercury thermometers is on the decline.
Glass-Alcohol Thermometer
Glass-alcohol thermometer is constructed in the same manner as the glass - mercury
thermometer, but replacing mercury by ethyl alcohol (ethanol). Since the melting
point of ethanol is -115 oC, it is suitable for measuring low temperatures much below
0 oC. Ethanol is a suitable liquid for thermometers as it has a high expansion relative
to most other liquids and as the expansion increases uniformly with temperature.
Since purified ethanol is a colorless liquid, it is colored with a coloring material in
order to see the alcohol column clearly.
Digital Thermometer
In addition the thermometers mentioned above, digital
thermometers from which the temperature can be read
directly are also commonly used today. In constructing
digital thermometers, an electrical property such as
the resistance which depends on the temperature is
used instead of the expansion caused by an increase in
temperature.
9.1.2 Temperature Scales
Figure 9.5 - A Digital
thermometer
There are three temperature scales widely used for temperature measurements.
They are the Celsius, Fahrenheit and the Kelvin scales.
² Celsius Scale
The Celsius scale has been formed by taking the temperature at which pure ice
melts into liquid water under the pressure of one atmosphere as the zero temperature
(0 oC) and the temperature at which water vaporizes into steam under the same
pressure as 100 oC.
These two temperatures have been chosen for the Celsius scale as the temperature

at which ice melts into water and the temperature at which water boils can be easily
obtained and as these temperatures have fixed values apart from the variation with
pressure.
The definite temperatures used in forming a temperature scale are known as fixed
points. For the Celsius scale, these two fixed points are divided into 100 divisions.
² Fahrenheit Scale
For the Fahrenheit scale too, the melting point of ice and the boiling point of water
are used as the two fixed points. However, here the melting point of ice is taken as
32 oF and the temperature range between the two fixed points are divided into 180
divisions. Accordingly, the boiling point of water is 212 oF.
² Kelvin Scale
The zero values of the Celsius and the Fahrenheit scales have been chosen according
to the wishes of the people who introduced them. However, the British scientist
Lord Kelvin later showed that there is a minimum value to the temperature that any
object can reach. This temperature is known as the absolute zero temperature.
The temperature of an object is a measure of the mean kinetic
energy of the particles that constitute the object. The temperature
of the object decreases when the kinetic energy of the particles
decreases. When the kinetic energy of all the particles become
zero, the temperature of the object reaches the absolute zero.
Its temperature cannot be decreased below this value. This
temperature has been found to be - 273.15 oC according to the
Celsius scale.
Figure 9.6 -Lord
Kelvin
The Kelvin scale is defined so that its zero (0 K) is at the absolute zero temperature.
However, in this scale, a temperature difference equal to 1 K is chosen to be equal
to a temperature difference of 1 oC.
Accordingly, the melting temperature of ice is 273.15 K and the boiling temperature
of water is 373.15 K. These temperatures are approximately taken as 273 K and 373 K
respectively.
The international unit of measuring temperatures is the Kelvin (K).

Since the difference between the Kelvin and Celsius scales lies only in the temperature
chosen for their zero values, in order to convert a temperature measured in Celsius
into the Kelvin scale one only needs to add 273. In order to convert a temperature
measured in Kelvin into the Celsius scale one has to subtract 273.

Celsius scale?

(iv) What has to be done in order to convert a temperature value given in Kelvin

Solution
(i) 100 Celsius divisions = 100 Kelvin divisions
1 Celsius division = 1 Kelvin division
(ii) 273 Has to be added to the given value.

Let us put equal volumes of water into two identical vessels at room temperature.
Next let us insert two thermometers and arrange the set up above two bunson
burners as shown in the Figure 9.8. Now let us light up the bunson burner in Figure

The temperature of the water in Figure 9.8(a) remains unchanged. The temperature
of the water in Figure 9.8(b) can be seen to increase gradually.
Only the bunson burner in Figure 9.8(b) has been lighted. Therefore the temperature
of water in that vessel has increased. From this it is clear that something has
transferred from the candle flame to the water and that the temperature of the water
has risen as a result of it. Here, heat has transferred to the water.
Therefore, the energy transfers from one object to another as a result of the
temperature difference existing between the two objects is known as the heat.

American national Benjemin Thompson (Count Ramford) (1753 – 1814)has
first described heat as a form of energy. In 1798, he experimentally showed
that heat is a form of energy and thereafter it was a scientist named James
Joule, who experimentally investigated about heat in 1840.

9.2.1 Heat Transfer
Let us investigate what happens when we put a heated piece of iron into a cold
water vessel.
Activity 9.1
Apparatus required: A heated block of iron, A thermometer, A stirrer, A vessel
with water at room temperature.

You will observe that the temperature of the water rises.
Figure 9.9
What happens here is the flow of heat from the iron which is at a higher temperature
into the water which is at a lower temperature.
As the temperature of the water increases, the vessel also heats up as a result of
absorbing heat. As heat flows out from the iron block, its temperature gradually
decreases. After a while, the temperatures of the water and the iron block become
equal. After reaching this common temperature, heat does not flow to the water
from the iron block or to the iron block from the water. This state is known as
thermal equilibrium. Just as water flows from a higher level to a lower level, heat
also flows from a body at a higher temperature to a body at a lower temperature.

Therefore,
² Heat transfers from a body at a higher temperature to a body at a lower
temperature.
² Then the temperature of the body at the lower temperature increases.
² At the same time, the temperature of the body at the higher temperature
decreases.
Since heat is a form of energy, heat can be measured in Joules (J). The international
unit for measuring heat is the Joule. In addition to this, the unit known as the Calorie
is also frequently used to measure heat (thermal energy).
9.2.2 Heat Capacity of an Object
Activity 9.2
Apparatus required : Three identical beakers, Water, Coconut oil, Three
thermometers, Three bunson burners a stirrer
² Obtain three identical beakers and pour a measured volume of water into one
of them.
² Pour an equal volume of coconut oil into another beaker.
² Pour water with a volume equal to twice the initial volume into the third
beaker.
² Measure the temperatures of the liquids in all three beakers.
² Now place all three beakers on three identical stands and heat them up for an
equal time interval (about 5 minutes) using three identical candles.
² At the end of the time interval measure the temperatures of the liquids.

Figure 9.10
Even though there could be minor differences in the candles, we could assume that
approximately the same amount of heat was supplied to each of the three beakers.
However you will observe that the temperature rise in the three beakers are different.
You will understand from this activity that when the same amount of heat is supplied
to different quantities of the same substance or the same quantities of different
substances, their temperatures rise in different amounts.

Heat
Since the temperature rise in the three beakers of the above activity were not equal
although the same amount of heat was supplied to all three beakers, we can conclude
that the heat capacities of the substances in the three beakers are different.
The amount of heat required to increase the temperature of an object by one unit
is known as the heat capacity of the object.
² The international unit for measuring heat capacity is Joules per Kelvin (J K-1).
² Heat capacity can also be expressed in Joules per degree Celsius (J oC-1).
The heat capacity of an object depends on the substance that the object is made
of and it’s mass. Two objects made out of the same substance but with different
masses have different heat capacities. Even though the masses are the same, two
objects made out of different substances can have different heat capacities. The heat
capacity of a substance is indicated by the symbol C.
² Specific Heat Capacity
It can be experimentally shown that the heat capacity of different masses of the
same substance is proportional to the mass. This means that the heat capacity
doubles when the mass is doubled. However the heat capacity of a unit mass of a
given substance or the amount of heat required to increase the temperature of a unit
mass of the substance by one degree is a property that depends on the substance.
The amount of heat required to increase the temperature of a unit mass of a given
substance by one degree is known as the specific heat capacity of the substance.
Since the specific heat capacity is the amount of heat that should be supplied to
increase the temperature of a unit mass of a given substance by one degree, it can
also be described as the heat capacity of a unit mass. Therefore, the heat capacity
of an object can be obtained by multiplying the specific heat capacity of an object
by its mass.
Heat capacity = Mass × Specific heat capacity
C = mc
Units of specific heat capacity is J kg-1 K-1 (Joules per kilogramme per Kelvin) or
J kg-1 oC-1 (Joules per kilogramme per degree Celsius).
The specific heat capacity of a substance is indicated by the symbol c.

When a substance absorbs or releases heat its temperature changes. In order to find
the quantity of heat flow, the following relation can be established.
If the specific heat capacity of a substance is c,
² Quantity of heat required to increase the temperature of 1 kg by 1 oC = c
² Quantity of heat required to increase the temperature of m kg by 1 oC = mc
² Quantity of heat required to increase the temperature of m kg by θ oC = mcθ
If the quantity of heat is Q,
Quantity of heat (Q) = mass (m) × specific heat
capacity (c)
×
temperature
change (θ)
Q = mcθ
Q - quantity of heat (J)
m - mass (kg)
c - specific heat capacity (J kg-1 K-1 or J kg-1 oC-1)
θ - temperature difference (K or oC)
This means that the amount of heat required to increase the temperature of a given
mass of a substance by a certain amount is equal to the product between the increase
in temperature and the heat capacity.
In terms of magnitude, one Kelvin and one degree of Celsius are the same. Therefore,
when we consider a temperature range, we can specify it in Celsius instead of using

9.3 Change of State of Matter
You have learnt before that there are three states of matter known as solid, liquid
and gas. As an example, when it is being heated ice melts into water and water
converts into vapor. By absorbing or releasing heat, water changes from one state
to another state.

Heat
The conversion of the state of a substance from solid, liquid or gas into another
state is known as a change of state. Condensation of a gas, melting of a solid,
solidification of a liquid, boiling of a liquid are examples of changes of state.
Melting Point
The temperature at which a solid substance that is being heated changes state from
the solid state to the liquid state is known as its melting point. The melting point of
a given substance depends of the pressure.
Freezing Point
The temperature at which a liquid substance that is being cooled changes state from
the liquid state to the solid state is known as its freezing point. The freezing point
of a given substance depends of the pressure.
The melting point and the freezing point of a given substance
have the same value.
Melting points of some solids are given in table 9.2.

liquid turns to vapour by forming bubbles inside the liquid) is known as its boiling
point.

Normally, the boiling points and melting points of materials are specified as the
temperatures at which boiling or melting occur under the pressure of 1 atmosphere.

9.3.1 Latent Heat
The change of state of a substance takes place as a result of supplying heat to the
substance or removing heat from it. Atoms of substances that exist as solids at room
temperature possess some amount of kinetic energy. When heat is supplied, this
kinetic energy increases gradually and along with it the temperature of the substance
increases. When heat is continuously supplied, at a certain point the kinetic energy
of the atoms becomes large enough to break the bonds between the atoms and allow
the atoms to move freely. This is the point that the substance changes state from the
solid state to the liquid state.
At the point that the change of state takes place, the heat supplied is spent on breaking
the bonds between molecules and therefore, the temperature of the substance does
not increase. When the change of state of all atoms is complete, the heat supplied is
spent again on increasing the temperature of the system.
The heat absorbed by the system without changing its temperature while the change
of state is taking place is known as the latent heat.
Consider an instance when heat is being supplied to a block of ice at a temperature
slightly below 0 oC.
0 oC
latent heat
0 oC
solid ice
liquid water
Figure 9.12
At first, its temperature would increase gradually up to 0 oC. Since 0 oC is the
melting point of ice, the heat supplied thereafter is spent on doing work against
the intermolecular attractive forces between the water molecules and the ice at
0 oC becomes water at 0 oC. If heat is supplied further after the block of ice has
completely melted into water, then the heat supplied will be spent on increasing the
temperature of the water again.

Heat
Conversion of a solid into a liquid is known as fusion and the heat absorbed in the
conversion of ice at 0 oC into water at 0 oC is known as the latent heat of fusion.
Any solid substance that undergoes fusion absorbs latent heat, not only ice. If the
fused substance is cooled, it solidifies again, releasing the same amount of heat that
it absorbed during fusion. Therefore, when the water mass at 0 oC is cooled, the
same quantity of latent heat is released and the water becomes ice.
Now let us consider an instance where heat is supplied to water at 100 oC.

Since water is at its boiling point, here too a change of state takes place. Here again,
work has to be performed against the intermolecular attractive forces. Therefore,
the heat supplied is first spent on doing work against the intermolecular attractive
forces and the temperature does not change until all the water at 100 oC becomes
steam. The latent heat absorbed in this instance is known as the latent heat of
vaporization.
Any liquid that vaporizes absorbs latent heat while this vapor releases the same
amount of latent heat upon condensation back into the liquid.

latent heat of vaporization of
water.
The amount of heat required to change the state of a unit mass of a solid substance
at its boiling point into the gas state is known as the specific latent heat of
vaporization of the substance.
Evaporation and Vaporization
The conversion of a liquid into a gaseous state is called vaporization. Liquid
into a gaseous can happen in one of two ways. One is the boiling that takes place
at the boiling point of a liquid when further heat is supplied. The other is the
conversion of the liquid into a gas gradually at temperatures below the boiling
point. The conversion of a liquid at a temperature below the boiling point is known
as evaporation.
In vaporization due to either of the processes boiling and evaporation, latent heat is
absorbed. Generally, evaporation takes place only at the surface of a liquid exposed
to air. However in boiling vaporization takes place even below the liquid surface.
This is why bubbles are formed in a boiling liquid.
In drying clothes and in perspiring to regulate our body temperature, evaporation
is the process that plays an important role. Since the specific latent heat of
vaporization has a fairly large value, in the evaporation of water through the process
of perspiration taking place from our skin, a large amount of heat is removed from
our body.

9.4 Thermal Expansion
You may have experienced that two glasses washed and one inserted
inside the other (A inside B) are found to be stuck together when you
examine them after a few days. At such an instance the two glasses
can be separated by pouring cold water into the inner glass and
inserting the outer glass in a vessel containing warm water.
Heat

In this case it becomes possible to separate the two glasses because
the glass inserted in warm water expands slightly while the glass into
which cold water was poured contracts slightly.
Figure 9.16
The increase in dimensions of a substance subjected to an increase in temperature
is known as thermal expansion. That is, the increase in its length, area or volume
is called expansion. Similarly, the decrease in dimensions of a substance subjected
to a decrease in temperature is known as contraction. That is, the decrease in its
length, area or volume is called contraction.

Influences and Applications of Expansion of Solids
² When fitting iron rims to wooden cart wheels, the diameter of the iron rim is
chosen to be slightly less than that of the wooden wheel. Then the iron rim
is heated and expanded until the wheel can be inserted into it. After inserting
the wooden wheel into the iron rim, it is allowed to cool and thus contract,
fitting it into the wheel securely.
² In railways, a small gap is left between two rails allowing them to expand
when the temperature rises, thus preventing the rails from being deformed
due to expansion.
Figure 9.18
² Telephone wires and cables carrying electricity are loosely fitted between
posts in order to allow them to contract without breaking the wires when the
environmental temperature drops.
Figure 9.19
² Tight fitting metallic bottle lids can be easily opened by heating them up to
expand slightly.
The reason for this is that the expansion of metals is larger than that of glass
making the lid slightly larger than the bottle when they are heated up.

inequal expansions rigidly riveted together. One of its ends is rigidly fixed to a piece
of metal while the other end remains free. When the temperature of the bipolar strip
is increased, one of the strips expands more than the other. Then the two strips bend

In this experiment, first the test tube expands when the temperature of the water
increases. Then the liquid level drops down slightly. However when the liquid
inside the test tubes heats up, the liquid also begins to expand. When the expansion
of the liquid exceeds that of glass, the liquid level rises up again. When making
thermometers, thermal expansion of liquids is commonly used. In mercury and
alcohol thermometers, the expansion of liquid volume is used for measuring
temperature.

² Then attach a balloon to the opening as shown in Figure 9.23(a).
² Next place the bottle in another empty vessel and pour hot water into the vessel
as shown in Figure 9.23(b).
² Observe that the balloon inflates slightly.
² Also observe that the balloon shrinks when left outside for a while.
When the bottle is placed inside the ice vessel, the temperature of the air inside
the bottle is close to 0 oC. When it is placed inside the warm water bottle the
temperature of the cool air in the bottle increases close to the room temperature
and the air expands. This air cannot leave the bottle because of the balloon attached
to it. Instead, the balloon inflates. When the bottle is taken out, the air cools down
to the room temperature shrinking again.
From this experiment it is clear that the air inside the bottle expands when it heats
up and contracts when the air cools down.
9.5 Heat Transfer
If you touch the far end of a metal spoon inserted in a hot cup of tea you would feel
that it gets warmer gradually. Similarly if you hold your hand above a burning fire,
you would feel that the hand gets warmer. What has happened in these instances is
that heat has transferred along the spoon in the first case and upwards away from
the flame in the second. Heat passing from one place to another in this manner is
known as heat transfer.

Heat transfer occurs from the place with the higher temperature to the place with
the lower temperature. The energy known as thermal energy (heat) of an object
is actually present as the kinetic energy resulting from the random motion of the
particles that form the object. This energy can be the translational, rotational or
vibrational kinetic energy of the particles. Heat transfer is the spreading of kinetic
energy from a region with atoms having a high degree of random motion (with a
high temperature) to a region of atoms having a low degree of random motion (with
a low temperature).
There are three methods of transferring heat.
(1) Conduction
(2) Convection
(3) Radiation
Let us investigate these methods in a simple way.
9.5.1 Conduction
The handle of a metal spoon held in a hot water soon gets warm. Heat passes along
the spoon by conduction.
Some examples where heat transfers by condition are given below.
² Heat flow along a metallic rod in contact with a flame.
² Heat flow from the bottom to the interior of a vessel placed on a cooker.
The main method of heat transfer through solids is conduction.
Since the atoms of a solid are tightly bound to one another, they cannot freely move
throughout the volume of the solid. In such substances, heat exists as the vibrational
kinetic energy of atoms. In metallic substances, part of the thermal energy exists
as kinetic energy of freely moving electrons (free electrons) in addition to this.
Conduction is the spreading of the kinetic energy of atoms and electrons throughout
the substance due to collisions among these particles.

Substances that conduct heat efficiently are known as good conductors and
substances that do not conduct heat efficiently are known as insulators.
good conductors – silver, copper, iron, mercury, aluminium
Examples:
Insulators – wood, plastic, asbestos, clay, wool
Existence of free electrons in metals make metals good conductors.
In liquids, molecules are not very tightly bound.
Therefore, conduction of current through liquids
is very weak. Water is a very poor thermal
conductor.
This Robbin has fluffed out its feathers to trap a
layer of air. Air is a poor conductor of heat and
so the bird manages to keep warm even in cold
weather.

Seals, spend all of their lives in cold water. They are protected from losing heat by
conduction by a very thick layer of fat (blubber) which surrounds their body.

from one end.

Figure 9.27 – Metal rod heated at one end
vibrating atoms
Suppose that the metallic rod shown in figure 9.27 is heated by a flame at the end A.
Then the atoms at that end begin to vibrate with a large amplitude by receiving
thermal energy (heat) from the flame. In addition to this, the free electrons in
random motion at that end gain kinetic energy from the flame. As a result of the
increased kinetic energy, these atoms collide with adjacent atoms. Due to the
collisions, energy transfers to one atom from another increasing the amplitude
of vibrations. This process continues through the atoms in the rod from A to B
in succession, transferring thermal energy along the rod. Thermal energy is also
transferred by the free electrons in random motion in the rod by receiving thermal
energy from the flame.

9.5.2 Convection
Heat
The water is heated just under the purple crystal - the crystal colours
the water as it dissolves. The heated water expands and becomes
less dense than the colder surrounding water, so it floats up to the
top of the beaker. Colder water sinks to take its place, and is then
heated too.
When heat is supplied to liquids or gases they expand and decrease
in density and move upwards. In order to fill these gaps, liquids or
gases with lower temperatures move downwards. Due to this process, heat flows
upwards from the region where heat is supplied. This is known as convection.
Figure 9.28
When a fire is lighted underneath a tree, branches and leaves above
the fire tend to swing about and burn as a result of the upward
motion of heated up air particles.
Upward motion of heated up particle streams is known as
convection currents.
Consider the figures below showing an immersion heater used to
heat up water.
Figure 9.29
Figure 9.30 - An immersion heater used to heat up water
Figure 9.30(a) shows a heater partially immersed in water. Here the water near the
bottom of the jug warms up slowly but the water near the top warms up fast. This
happens since convection currents do not flow downwards.
The immersion heater in Figure 9.30(b) is fully immersed inside the vessel. Then
water warms up from bottom to top. Heated up water particles become lighter and
move upwards and the water particles that are not heated up move down as their
density is higher. When heated up they too move upwards. This process takes place
continually heating up the whole jug of water.

This reduces the pressure near the ground. Then an air mass flows from the sea to

You will be able understand that it is not
due to either conduction or convection
that you feel the warmth near a burning

means that heat has transferred. We feel
the warmth when thermal rays travel
through space in the form of rays (waves)
from the flame and reach our bodies.

Heat
The propagation of heat in the form of electromagnetic radiation from a warm
body without the aid of matter is known as thermal radiation. For heat transfer
by radiation, a material medium is not required. However, for heat transfer by
conduction or convection, particles of a medium are essential.
Heat from the sun reach the earth through a vacuum of about 150 million kilometres
as thermal radiation. Any heated body emits heat as radiation.
² Absorption and Reflection of Thermal Radiation
When thermal radiation is incident on an object, part of the radiation is absorbed by
the object while another part is reflected. The surface roughness or the smoothness
and the colour of the surface of the object are the factors affecting the amount of
thermal radiation absorbed or reflected.
Absorption of thermal radiation is high from darker surfaces and rough surfaces.
Reflection of thermal radiation is high from shining surfaces.
Reflection of heat radiation by polished surfaces and by white surfaces are very
high.
Black surfaces absorb a high amount of heat while they reflect a very low amount
of heat.
Assignment 9.6
Design an experiment to find out from which out of dark, white and shining
surfaces that thermal radiation is most effectively absorbed. Write down the
conclusions you can draw based on your observations.
² Situations where thermal radiation is important
When cricketers dress in white during the day time in the presence of sunlight,
the absorption of thermal radiation is very low. Then warming up of the body is
controlled.
Wearing dark colors inside homes by people in cold climates increase the absorption
of thermal radiation. This helps to maintain the body temperature.
If the cooking utensils placed on cookers are black in color, they can absorb thermal
radiation efficiently and transfer heat to the vessels fast.
The inner surfaces of thermos flasks are silvered to make them highly reflective.
These surfaces reflect heat radiated by the contents inside the bottle or heat radiation
coming from outside.

Specific latent heat capacity of vaporization is the heat required to
convert a unit mass of a liquid at its boiling point into a vapor at the same
temperature.
The unit of specific latent heat capacity is J kg-1.
The increase in length, area or volume taking place when an object is
heated up is known as thermal expansion.
² Heat transfer is the flow of heat from a point at a higher temperature to a
point at a lower temperature.
²
The three methods of heat transfer are conduction, convection and
radiation.
² Conduction is the forward flow of heat through any material by heating
up of the constituent particles one by one in succession.
² Convection is the flow of heat by the upward motion of particles by
decreasing the density when liquids or gases are heated up.
² Radiation is the flow of heat from a heated body in the form of
electromagnetic waves without the aid of a material medium.

We use electric energy to do various jobs in our daily lives conveniently. On all
these occasions we convert electric energy into another form of energy to suit our
requirements. This energy conversion takes place in various electric appliances.
The instruments used for these energy conversions are known as electric appliances.
The main forms of energy conversions that take place in some electric appliances
used in daily life are given in the Figure 10.1.

For extra knowledge
In some electric appliances, after the first energy conversion, another energy
conversion also takes place and we use that energy. As an example, in a filament
bulb, electric energy is initially converted into heat which increases the temperature
of the filament resulting in the emission of light. In fluorescent lights electric energy
is first converted into ultraviolet radiation which is next converted into visible light.

Power and Energy of Electric Appliances
10.1 Power output of an electric appliance
We know that power is the work done in a unit time.
Just like in mechanical work, power is the rate of doing work in work done by
electricity too. That is, power is the work done in a unit time or the energy
consumed in a unit time.

Energy
Figure 10.2 - An electric appliance operating with a potential difference V and
drawing a current I
Therefore the rate of energy consumption P by an electric appliance operated with
a voltage V and drawing a current I is given by the following equation.
Power = voltage × current
P = VI
When the voltage, V is measured in Volts (V) and the current, I in Amperes (A) the
power, P is given in Watts (W).
Example 1
When a filament bulb is connected across a voltage difference of 12 V, a current of
2 A flows through it. What is the power of the bulb?
Power P = VI
= 12 × 2 W
P = 24 W
Power of the bulb is 24 W.
Example 2
An electric oven operates under a 230 V power supply. If it has a power output of
2000 W, find the current drawn when the oven is working.
P = VI
∴ 2000 = 230 × I
∴ I = 2000
230
= 8.69 A
The current drawn by the oven is 8.69 A.

Power and Energy of Electric Appliances
In the heating coils (heating element) of electric ovens, the energy consumed is
converted only into heat. In some other appliances, part of the electric energy
is converted into heat due to their internal resistance, while the remaining part is
converted into other forms of energy.
10.2 Electric energy consumed by electric appliances
Power is the rate of consumption of energy or the energy consumed in a unit time by
an electric appliance. Therefore, the total energy consumed by an electric appliance
depends on the time duration that it operates.
If the energy consumed during a unit time interval is P, the total amount of electric
energy consumed in a time t is Pt. If the total energy consumed is E,
E = Pt
When P is measured in Watts (W) and the time t in seconds (s), the electrical energy
E is given in Joules (J).
Since P = VI, substituting VI for P,
E = Pt = VIt
Total Energy = voltage × current × time
E = VIt
In order to find the energy consumed by an electric appliance, the relation E = VIt
can also be used.
Example 1
The power of the head light of a motor car is 50 W. Find the energy consumed
when this lamp is operated for 11
2
hours.
E = Pt
E = 50 × 1.5 × 60 × 60 J
E = 270 000 J
The amount of energy consumed is 270 000 J.

lighting this bulb for five minutes?
E = VIt
E = 6 × 0.6 × 5 × 60
E = 1080 J
Total electric energy consumed is 1080 J.
10.3 Efficiency of electric appliances and conserving power
In many instances, the same purpose can be achieved using various different
appliances. In order to get illumination we can use filament bulbs, LED bulbs,
fluorescent light tubes or CFL lights (compact fluorescent lights). Choosing a more
efficient appliance helps us to save energy. A few different types of bulbs giving the
same illumination, their power output and life times are given in Table 10.1 below.

According to Table 10.1, it is advantageous to use LED bulbs as light sources.
However, the use of LED bulbs in Sri Lanka is limited due to their high initial cost.
Similarly, the efficiencies of cookers used to prepare food are different from one to
another due to varying amounts of heat wastage. Old cookers that use heating coils
are the lowest in efficiency. Emersion heater is highly efficient for heating water.
The reason is that, all the heat generated in the heater is transferred to water when
using it. Heaters which contains hot plates such as rice cooker is more efficient
because heat loss is less from them. Although microwave ovens cannot be used
to cook all types of food, they are very efficient since they produce heat inside the
food items. In addition to these, induction cookers with high efficiencies are now
available in the market. In these devices, the variable magnetic field emitted by the
cooker generates heat only at the bottom of the cooking utensil.

For extra knowledge
The power consumption of television sets that use LCD screens is lower than that
of the old televisions that use cathode ray tubes. LCD television sets that use LED
lights to illuminate the screen have a very low power consumption and are known
as LED televisions in the market.
Similarly, it is more efficient to use table fans to cool houses than ceiling fans.
Using the most efficient device suitable for a particular purpose whenever possible
would help to minimize the future energy crisis.
If 40% of the energy supplied to a certain electric appliance is lost as heat, then
only 60% of the energy would be used for the expected purpose. This means that
the efficiency of the electric appliance is 60%. We should try to minimize the loss
of electric energy as heat and get the maximum out of the electric energy supplied
for a particular purpose. Ironing all clothes required for a week in one occasion is
more efficient because it saves electricity used in the initial heating of the iron. All
the unwanted lights of the home should be switched off. Also, you have to use more
efficient bulbs such as CFL and LED bulbs.
Assignment 10.1
Prepare a list of electric devices used in households and indicate their power
usage against them (You may use the specification labels pasted on the device or
the instruction sheet provided with the device to do this. Get assistance from an
adult when this is not possible.)
10.4 Home Electric Circuits
Electric energy required to operate home electric appliances is obtained from the
national electric grid. Electric energy generated by electric power stations are
raised to high voltages such as 132 kV or 220 kV using step-up transformers and
distributed throughout the island. In distribution sub-centres, these high voltages
are lowered to voltages such as 33 kV or 11 kV and ultimately they are lowered
down to 230 V before supplying to households. Electricity provided to houses is in
the form of an alternating current with a frequency of 50 Hz.

10.4.1 Components of a Domestic Electric Circuit
² Overload circuit breaker (or Service fuse)
Electricity supplied to household first passes through a fuse connected to the live
cable. This fuse is arranged to allow the passage of a maximum current of about
40 A. If a larger current passes through it, the circuit breaker disconnects power to
the house. When that happens, the power can be reconnected by moving the lever
up, manually. In older houses, a fuse, is used instead of a circuit breaker. When
a current above the limit passes through the fuse wire which is made of an alloy
consisting of lead and tin, it heats up and melts disconnecting the power supply.
The fuse wire is inserted in a ceramic tube or a ceramic mount.
Only the live wire is disconnected by the overload circuit breaker or the service fuse.
Figure 10.6(a) shows a overload circuit breaker and Figure 10.6(b) shows a service
fuse.

² Electricity Meter
Consumers are billed according to the amount of electricity they consume. The
meter records the electric energy in kilowatt hours (kW h). The live and neutral wires
coming through the over load circuit breaker or service fuse are next connected to
the electricity meter. These two wires coming from the electricity meter are next
connected to the main switch. An electricity meter is shown in Figure 10.7.
Overload circuit breaker and the electricity meter are
properties belonging to the service provider (electricity
board or electricity company) and any problem with
these items should be solved by informing the service
provider.
Figure 10.7 - An electricity meter
²
Isolator (or Main Switch with Main Fuse)
All items in the domestic circuit beyond the isolator belong to the consumer. After
passing through the electric meter, the live wire passes through an isolator that
allows the passage of a maximum current of 30 A. Isolator acts as a 30 A high
current circuit breaker too. In any instance, by the lowering of the switch levers, it
can be disconnected the home hold circuit from power mains (L and N).
In older domestic electrical circuits, a main switch consisting of a 30 A fuse
and a dipole switch was used in place of the isolator. The isolator is capable of
disconnecting both the live and the neutral wires. Such switches are known as dual
pole switches. Disconnecting the domestic circuit for any repair purpose can be
done by turning off the isolator. Figure 10.8(a) shows the outward appearance of an
isolator and Figure 10.8(b) shows the circuit diagram of a main switch.

² Residual Current Circuit Breaker - RCCB (or Trip Switch)
After the isolator, the live wire and the neutral wire are connected to a RCCB or a
tripped switch. The purpose of connecting to a RCCB is to protect the residents from
electric shocks. When there is a current leak to the metal caring of an appliance or
to the ground the circuit is automatically disconnect by the RCCB. The RCCB too
is a dual pole switch. Outward appearance of a RCCB is shown in Figure 10.9(a)

² Distribution Box
Power and Energy of Electric Appliances
Electricity is distributed for consumption in the household through the distribution
box. Electricity is distributed inside the house through lighting circuits and plug
circuits. Adequate current to light bulbs in ordinary rooms is supplied by lighting
circuits. The maximum current supplied to a lighting circuit is limited to 6 A. Plug
circuits are connected to places such as the kitchen that have devices like electric
heaters and electric ovens that consume a large amount of electricity. Plug circuits
allow the consumption of current upto about 13 A.

² Miniature circuit breakers (MCB) and fuses
Miniature circuit breakers (MCB) supplying electricity are connected to each circuit
inside the distribution box. When a current larger than the maximum current that
can pass through the circuit is drawn, miniature circuit breakers automatically get
disconnected and the lever shifts down to the off position. Because of this, the
electricity supply gets disconnected only in these circuits and not to the whole
household. For lamp circuits, MCBs which can conduct a current of 6 A are used.
For socket circuits, MCBs which can conduct a current of 13 A are used.
While bulbs and two 6 A plugs can be connected to a lighting circuit, only plugs can
be connected to plug circuits. Figure 10.11 shows the outward appearance of a fuse
mount and a miniature circuit breaker.

MCBs can be mounted in specially designed distribution boxes. MCBs provide
protection against electric shorts and resulting fires due to heated cables only. Since
the fuse or the MCB does not operate when a person gets an electric shock, they do
not provide any protection to people.
In older domestic circuits, fuses were used instead of MCB. In lighting circuits,
5 A fuses were used instead of 6 A MCBs. Instead of 13 A MCBs, 15 A fuses were
used. The use of fuses has declined because replacing fuse wires of blown fuses is
inconvenient. When MCBs or fuses are connected, they must always be connected
to the live wire.
In modern domestic circuit, isolator, RCCB and the distribution box are included in
the same units called consumer units. A consumer unit is shown in figure 10.12.
Figure 10.12 - A consumer unit
For extra knowledge
One of the two cables providing electricity to households is earthed near the
step down transformer that distributes electricity to the house. Then a potential
difference of 230 V is established between the other cable and the earth. Earthed
cable maintains a zero potential (Earth is assumed to be at a zero potential).

Physics
Power and Energy of Electric Appliances
Now if a person standing on the ground touches the cable that is not grounded,
he would receive an electric shock due to the 230 V potential difference across
his body (An electric shock is the damage caused to the body by passing an
electric current through the body). A 50 mA current passing through the body is
considered a major electric shock while a 100 mA current can cause death. Since
touching the ungrounded cable causes electric shocks, this cable is known as the
“live” cable. Since touching the grounded cable from the ground does not give
rise to a potential difference across the body, this cable is known as the neutral
cable.
One cable is made to be a live cable in this manner since it is essential for the
operation of the RCCB that protects the household from accidents related to
electric shocks. If the live wire gets grounded anywhere inside the house, the RCCB
automatically disconnects the electricity supply to the house by detecting the large
current passing through it. The RCCB operates from electromagnetic induction and
if a current of about 35 mA passes through the switch to ground, it automatically
turns off. In addition to this, a flow of about 30 A into the house (short circuit)
the RCCB operates and disconnects the electricity supply to the house. Although
the RCCB sometimes disconnects the electricity supply when there is lightning
activity, its protection from lightning damage is not assured.
² Switches and Plug sockets
Switches used to turn on or off power to electric
bulbs are major components in domestic circuits.
Switches are available as single units or as units
consisting of several switches on the same board.
Switches are connected to the circuit so as to enable
the turning on or off of each bulb separately.
A single switch
Four switches
Figure 10. 13 – Switches
Another important component in a domestic circuit is
the plug socket. The live cable, the neutral cable and
the separately grounded earth cable are connected to
these circuit elements. The larger terminal of a three-pin
plug socket is connected to the external metal cover of
an electric appliance and it connects to the earth wire in
the domestic circuit when plugged on. This connection is
essential in order to get protection from electric shocks
by turning off the trip switch. For some of the modern
Figure 10.14 – A plug

electric equipment having a plastic cover that does not leak electricity, two-pin
plugs can be used. Two-pin plug sockets are not connected to the earth wire.
Two pin plugs
A three pin plug
Figure 10.15 – Plugs and plug sockets
² Connecting Wires
Copper wires with suitable cross-sectional areas are used as connecting wires
for carrying currents. Single cables with a 1 mm2 cross-sectional area (1.13 mm
diameter) are used in order to carry 5 A or 6 A currents while cables consisting of
seven wires with a 1.5 mm2 effective cross-sectional area are used for 15 A or 13 A
plug circuits.
A brown PVC cover is used to identify the live wire while a blue PVC cover is used
to identify the neutral wire. Previously red and black covers were used to identify
live and neutral wires respectively. Green covers are used for the earth wire.
10.4.2 Domestic Electric Circuit
Each bulb and each plug in a domestic circuit is connected in parallel to one another.
All switches should be connected to the live wire. Therefore touching a bulb circuit
when the switch is in the off position does not cause electric shocks.
Plug circuits are connected using cables that can withstand a current of 13 A. Only
plugs are connected in these circuits and this type of circuits are often used in
kitchens.
Sometimes plug circuits are connected as ring circuits. Such a ring circuit is shown
in Figure 10.16. Cables with smaller diameters can be used in such circuits since
each plug receives current through two wires.

10.4.3 Protective Measures in Domestic Circuits
Figure 10.16 – A loop circuit
Basically there are two protective measures in domestic electric circuits. These are
the residual current circuit breaker and the fuse or MCB’s.
² Residual current circuit breaker - RCCB (or Trip Switch)
In case of a current leakage in the electric appliances or an electric shock, the
RCCB disconnects the power supply to the whole house hold. In addition to this,
the RCCB also disconnects power if a current greater than 30 A flows through the
circuit. This prevents fire arising from over- heated main cables.
² Fuses or MCB’s
These electrical components prevent large currents flowing through domestic
circuits. Fuses or MCB’s do not provide protection from accidents due to current
leaks or electric shocks.
If there is a power disconnection due to any of the above reasons, the overload
circuit breaker should be opened (turned OFF) first. Next, the lever of the RCCB
or that of the MCB should be turned upwards (to the ON position) and then close
(turn ON) the overload circuit breaker again. If the power supply gets disconnected
again, the circuit should be repaired by an electrician.
Further to the above, it is very important to follow the following precautionary
measures for safety.
² Only fuses appropriate for 6 A and 13 A currents should be used.
² Many electric appliances that draw a total current exceeding the capacity of the
plug socket should not be connected to the plug socket through a multi-plug.
² Only plugs suitable for a plug socket should be inserted into a plug socket.
Wires should not be inserted into a plug socket.

² When using an electric iron for ironing clothes, rubber slippers or a rubber
carpet underneath the feet should be used. It is good to use a mat in front of a
refrigerator for safety.
² Tasks such as changing burnt bulbs in bathrooms should not be done without
turning off the overload circuit breaker or the main switch.
² When electric appliances are not in use, their plugs should be disconnected
from the socket.
²
If there are strong lightning strikes, radio receivers and television sets should
be unplugged as much as possible. In such cases it is advisable to refrain from
using any unessential electric devices. (RCCBs do not protect the domestic
circuit from thunder).
² Electric devices should not be used when the body is wet. Electric switches
must not be turned on or off with wet hands.
² During a power failure, switches of electric appliances should not be turned on.
²
In case of a fire, the domestic power supply should be disconnected using the
overload circuit breaker.
² All maintenance work and installing power extensions should be done by a
trained electrician.
² The functioning of the RCCB should be checked every few days by pressing
the test button.
10.5 Measuring Electric Energy in kilowatt hours
² Commercial unit of measuring electric energy
Electric energy is measured in kilowatt hours by the domestic electricity meter.
One kilowatt hour is the amount of electric energy consumed during one hour by an
electric appliance with a power consumption of 1 kW. Although energy is usually
measured in Joules, when the consumption is high, energy in Joules gives a large
numerical value. Because of this, kilowatt hours (kW h) is used as the measuring
unit of electricity. The energy consumed in a second by a device with a 1 Watt
power is equal to one Watt second (W s) or one Joule (J).
∴ 1 kW h = 1 kW × 1 h
= 1000 W × 1 × 60 × 60 s
1 kW h = 3 600 000 J = 3.6 × 106 J
This shows that 1 kW h has a large numerical value in Joules.

during a month.

100 W power
Energy consumed by 5 bulbs of 60 W
power
}
}
= 100 × 4 × 3 W h
= 60 × 5 × 4 W h
Total energy consumed by all bulbs in a month
= (100 × 12 + 60 × 20) × 30 W h
Total energy consumed during a month
= (1200 + 1200) ×30 W h
Total electricity consumed during a month
kW h
= 2400 × 30
1000
= 72 kWh
Therefore, a total of 72 kW h of electricity is consumed during a month.
Summary
²
The power of an electric appliance is the amount of electric energy consumed
by it in a unit time.
² When a current I passes through an electric device due to a potential
difference V, its power P is given by P = VI

Electric energy E consumed by an electric device over a time period t is
given by E = VIt

11.1 Introduction
11Physics
Electronics has made a huge impact on our daily lives. We use many electronic
devices in our day to day activities. Mobile phone, computers, televisions and
radios are some examples for such electronic devices.
Figure 11.1
Materials that conduct electricity are known as electrical conductors. Conductors
(copper, aluminium, iron, lead etc.) and mixed conductors (brass, nychrome,
manganin) are examples of these. Materials that do not conduct electricity (ebonite,
polythene, plastic, dry wood, asbestos, glass etc) are known as electrical insulators.
The reason behind the ability to conduct electricity is the ability of some of the
electrons in the atoms of such materials to move freely within the conductor.
Electrons in the outer shells of conductors act in this manner since they are not
tightly bound to the nucleus. Since inter-atomic bonds (covalent bonds) between
the atoms of insulators are strong, there are very few electrons that are free to move.
Meanwhile, some materials conduct a small amount of electricity. Such materials
are known as semiconductors. Materials such as silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge)
in their crystalline form show such properties. These elements belong to the fourth
group in the periodic table and have four electrons in their outermost shell. Such
elements form crystal lattice structures by sharing the four electrons in their outermost
shell to make covalent bonds with four nearby atoms and thereby acquiring a stable
electronic configuration having eight electrons in the outermost shell.
However, these bonds are rather weak and can be broken from the thermal energy
available even at room temperature, releasing electrons.

Figure 11.2 shows the covalent bonds of the silicon lattice at 0 K. All the bonds are
complete at this temperature. Figure 11.3 shows that some bonds have been broken
releasing some free electrons at a temperature higher than 0 K. An electron deficiency
can be observed at the positions that the free electrons occupied previously. Such
positions with an electron deficiency are known as holes. Due to the positively
charged protons in the nucleus, a hole gives rise to a positive charge that has not
been neutralized (In a neutral atom, the number of protons in the nucleus is equal
to the number of and electrons). Therefore a hole is equivalent to a positive charge.

Figure 11.3 - A silicon lattice at temperature above 0 K
In semiconductors, not only electrons contribute to the conduction of electricity.
When an electron in an adjacent atom jumps to an atom with a hole having a
positive charge, the position of the hole can change. By changing the position of a
hole from one atom to another in this manner, holes can move around in the lattice
and contribute in conducting a current. Electrons act as negative charge carriers
while holes act as positive charge carriers.
Therefore, when an electric potential difference is applied across a semiconductor,
holes move from the positive to the negative potential while electrons move from
the negative to the positive potential and the (conventional) current flows from the
positive to the negative potential.
² In metallic conductors, the charge carriers that conduct electricity are the
negatively charged electrons.
² In semiconductors, the negatively charged electrons as well as the positively
charged holes act as the charge carriers that contribute in the conduction of
electricity.
² Since a hole is generated in the breaking of a bond to release an electron, the
number of carrier electrons present in a semiconductor is equal to the number
of holes.
² Therefore the semiconductor lattice is electrically neutral.

11.1.1 Intrinsic Semiconductors
Pure semiconductor materials such as silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge) that exist in
crystaline form as mentioned above are known as intrinsic semiconductors.
● Effect of Temperature on the Conduction of Electricity
Since the random motion of free electrons increases as the temperature is increased,
a rise in the temperature inhibits the current flow. Therefore, a temperature rise
in conductors causes a decrease in the conductivity (increase in the resistivity).
However in semiconductors, a rise in temperature breaks bonds generating more
holes and free electrons causing an increase in the conductivity (decrease in the
resistivity).
11.1.2 Extrinsic Semiconductors
Let us consider what happens when a minute amount of the element phosphorous
(P) is mixed (doped) to an intrinsic semiconductor such as Si. Phosphorous is an
element in group V of the periodic table and has five electrons in the outermost
shell. A phosphorous atom makes the number of electrons in its outermost shell
eight by acquiring four electrons from four nearby silicon atoms around it. In the
process, one of the five electrons is left behind without taking part in forming a
bond. This electron has the opportunity to move about freely in the lattice.

Figure 11.4 shows how a phosphorous atom forms bonds with silicon atoms. The
electron left behind increases the conductivity of the lattice. Since negatively
charged electrons are introduced to the lattice as charge carriers, the semiconductor
is known as a negative type or n-type semiconductor. Semiconductors whose

carriers have been increased by doping it with another element are known as
extrinsic semiconductors. By doping an intrinsic semiconductor with other
elements in group V such as arsenic (As) and antimony (Sb) also, n-type extrinsic
semiconductors can be formed. Since electrons are donated to the lattice by group
V elements, they are known as donor atoms.
If Si which is an intrinsic semiconductor is doped with an element in group III such
as boron (B), the boron atom forms bonds with nearby silicon atoms. However,
since there are only three electrons in the outermost shell of the boron atom, there
is a deficiency of one electron in order to form four bonds. Figure 11.5 shows how
the atoms and bonds are configured in this case.

doping
Figure 11.5 - A Si lattice doped by boron
A hole exists at the point where the electron is deficient in the boron atom to form
a bond. Since holes can conduct electricity as positive charges, the conductivity
of silicon increases. As a hole is equivalent to a positive charge, such extrinsic
semiconductors are known as positive or p-type semiconductors. Because the
hole concentration in p - type semiconductors is much greater than the electron
concentration holes are called majority carriers and electrons are called minority
curriers. By doping an intrinsic semiconductor with other elements in group III
such as aluminium (Al), gallium (Ga) and indium (In) instead of B also p-type
extrinsic semiconductors can be formed. Since holes that can receive electrons are
produced by group III elements, they are known as accepter atoms.
11.2 p – n Junction
By doping one side of an intrinsic semiconductor such as silicon or germanium
with a group III element to form a p-type semiconductor and the other side with a
group V element to form an n-type semiconductor, a p-n junction can be formed at
the centre of the semiconductor. Such a junction shows an electrical behaviour that
is different from normal conductors.

Figure 11.6 – p – n junction
As shown in Figure 11.6(a) as soon as the p–n junction is formed, the free electrons
in the n-region diffuse across the junction towards the p-region and the holes in the
p-region diffuse towards the n-region. Due to this diffusion, electrons and holes
recombine forming a region devoid of charges near the junction. This region is
known as the depletion layer or depletion region. As shown in Figure 11.6(b), extra
electrons have entered the p-side of the depletion region giving it a negative charge
while extra holes have entered the n-side of the depletion region giving it a positive
charge generating a voltage difference across the junction. This potential difference
repels the charge carriers impeding the diffusion of charge carriers across the
junction. Therefore this potential difference is known as a “potential barrier”. This
potential barrier is represented in the above figure as a hypothetical battery.
The magnitude of the potential barrier in a p-n junction formed by Si is about 0.7 V
while that formed by Ge is about 0.3 V.

11.2.1 Biasing a p-n Junction
Applying a potential difference across the p-n junction using an external electric
source is known as biasing. Depending on the direction of the bias voltage across
the junction, it behaves in one of two ways. Let us engage in activity 11.1 to
demonstrate this.

² Turn on the switch and observe the bulb.
² Next, disconnect only the battery and reconnect the battery as shown in Figure 11.8.
² Turn on the switch again. Observe the bulb.
Determine which of the above biasing methods allows a current to pass through the
diode. You will observe that the bulb turns on only when the diode is connected as
shown in Figure 11.7. According to this, you can use the junction diode when you
need the current to flow only in a desired direction in a circuit.
For extra knowledge
● In order for the p-n junction to be forward biased and allow a current to pass
through it, a positive potential should be connected to the anode and the
potential difference applied should be sufficient to overcome the potential
barrier across the junction. (For Si diodes this value should be greater than
0.7 V and for Ge diodes greater than 0.3 V).
● Reverse biased p-n junction
Let us consider what happens when a battery is connected to the junction with its
negative terminal connected to the p-type semiconductor and its positive terminal
connected to the n-type semiconductor.

In this case, the free electrons in the n-region are attracted towards the positive
potential while the holes are attracted towards the negative potential, broadening
the depletion layer. There is no carrier (charge) flow across the junction. Only the
depletion region broadens depending on the potential difference of the external
source. Since there is no charge flow, connecting the external potential in this
manner is known as reverse bias. Figure 11.8(a) and (b) shows how the depletion
layer behaves when it is reverse biased.

In this case the external potential source is connected with the positive potential
connected to the p-region and the negative potential connected to the n-region.
While the holes in the p-region are repelled by the positive potential towards the
junction, electrons in the n-region are repelled by the negative potential towards
the junction. The depletion region narrows down due to this and if the externally
supplied potential difference exceeds the potential barrier across the junction,
carriers flow across the junction. When a high potential than 0.7 V is applied
depletion layer is very small and a current is flowing through the p-n junction. Then
a current flows across the junction. Therefore, connecting the external voltage in
this manner is known as forward basing.
11.3 p-n Junction Diode
Now you know that a current flows across a p-n junction only if it is forward biased
in the manner described above. A component consisting only of such a p-n junction
is known as a junction diode. The arrangement of p and n semiconductors inside a
junction diode is illustrated in Figure 11.10(a) and the symbol used for a diode is
shown in Figure 11.10(b). Terminal A is known as the anode and terminal K is known
as the cathode. Electricity is conducted through the junction only when the anode A is
connected to the positive terminal of an external voltage supply and the direction of
current through the junction is shown with an arrow head in Figure 11.10(c).

cathode. There are large numbers of various
different types of diodes and a number is
printed on the cylinder in order to identify
them. But it should be remembered that the
external appearance of a diode can vary widely.
11.4 Rectification of Alternating Currents
We know that an alternating current is a current that alternates or changes its
direction of flow in a circuit. A direct current is a current that flows only in one

direction. The variation of the current or the voltage with time for direct currents
and alternating currents are shown in Figure 11.12. Usually, dynamos produce
electricity as alternating currents. However, for operating some electronic devices,
direct currents are required. Junction diodes that allow the current to flow in one
direction can be used for converting an alternating current to a direct current. The
task of converting an alternating current into a direct current that flows only in one
direction is known as “rectification”.

First the voltage is lowered to a desired value using the step-down transformer. The
lowered alternating potential difference is obtained from the X, Y terminals of the
transformer.
Since the current flow through the diode takes place only in the direction XL, the
current through the resistance R flows only during the positive half cycle of the
alternating current. During the negative half cycle, the current through the resistance
is zero (Compare this with the way the diode behaved when the batteries were
connected in activity 11.1).
Since the output always consists only of half a cycle of the current, this is known
as half wave rectification.

² Solder the four diodes in the form

bicycle dynamo or the alternating
power source to the terminals X
and Y and rotate the generator
slowly.

Figure 11.14
² Observe the deflection of the galvanometer. If the deflection is too large adjust
the rheostat to lower it.
In this activity, you will observe that the deflection in the galvanometers is only in
one direction. That means that the current has been converted to a direct current.
If four diodes are used in the form of a bridge in an appropriate manner and an
alternating current is passed through it instead of the single diode used earlier, both
half cycles of the alternating current can be made to flow in the same direction.
Figure 11.15 illustrates such a bridge circuit.
When a 4.5 V battery and a LED bulb is connected as shown in Figure 11.15(a)
the bulb lights up with its normal brightness. Here, the LED is used on a lamp that
is turned on when the current is flowing in one direction only. When point X is
positive relative to point Y, diodes D2 and D4 are reverse biased while diodes D1 and
D3 are forward biased. Then the current flowing through D1 passes through the bulb
and reaches the negative terminal of the battery after passing through diode D3.

Now if the circuit is reconnected with the negative terminal of the battery connected
to point X and the positive terminal connected to point Y as shown in Figure 11.15 (b),
the bulb would light up with the same brightness. In this case, the diodes D2 and D4
are forward biased and D1 and D3 are reverse biased. Therefore the current coming
from the positive terminal of the battery passes through diode D2, the bulb and
diode D4 and flows to the negative terminal of the battery. In both cases, the current
through the bulb flows in the same direction.
For extra knowledge
In figure 11.15, a 4.5 V battery is used to light a 2.5 V bulb because the current in
each case flows through two diodes producing a 2 × 0.7 = 1.4 V voltage drop. Due
to this drop across the diodes, the available voltage for the bulb is 4.5 – 1.4 = 3.1 V.
If a 3V battery is used instead of the 4.5 V battery, the remaining voltage of
3 - 1.4 = 1.6 V will not be sufficient to light the bulb.
Now if an alternating voltage is connected to the circuit in place of the battery, the
current flows through the bulb in the same direction (from P to Q).

Figure 11.16 – Full wave rectification using a bridge circuit
Figure 11.16 shows the direction of current flow through the diodes in the two
half cycles, positive and negative of the input. Since both cycles of the alternating
current through the bulb is made to flow in the same direction in the output, this
process is known as full wave rectification.
Exercise 11.2
Explain the reasons for your observations on the galvanometer in the two instances
in activity 11.2 and show the variations of the current with time graphically for
the two cases.
11.4.3 Smoothing
A half wave or full wave rectification circuit gives out a current flowing in one
direction. However its magnitude (voltage or current) varies between zero and a
maximum value.
Time variations of the voltage outputs from a battery, the half wave rectified output
and the full wave rectified output from an alternating current are shown in Figure
11.17. For the operation of most electronic devices, a constant voltage similar to
that obtained from a battery or a constant direct current is more suitable.

By connecting a capacitor with a large capacitance in parallel to the output terminals
of the rectifier circuit, the variation in rectified voltage can be reduced. This process
is known as smoothing. Figure 11.18 shows the output of a half wave rectified
after smoothing it using a capacitor. Rectifier circuit is shown in the figure (a) and
output without the capacitor is shown in (b). The figure (c) shows the output with
the capacitor.

When the voltage supplied by the diode gradually increases from zero, the capacitor
gets charged. When the voltage drops back after reaching a maximum value, the
charge stored in the capacitor is released. Therefore despite the voltage supplied
through the diode being zero, the voltage across the capacitor does not drop down to
zero although a small reduction takes place. In addition, because the current across
the diode is always in one direction only, the discharge current of the capacitor does
not flow through the diode. The time variation of the smoothed output voltage is
shown in Figure 11.18(c).
The output from full wave rectification too can be smoothed in the same manner.
Figure 11.19 shows the circuit diagram and the time variation of the output voltage
for such a rectification.

becomes better with increasing capacitance.

11.4.5 Light Emitting Diode (LED)
When a p-n junction formed with a semiconductor
material such as gallium arsenide (GaAs) is forward
biased, light is emitted at the junction. Such diodes
that are capable of emitting light are known as light
emitting diodes (LED).
Various types of diodes are available in the market
and Figure 11.22 shows the outward appearance, the symbol and how to identify
the terminals of one of the most popular types, the 5 mm LED. The longer terminal
of a diode is its anode. Similarly, if the base of the LED is pointed towards us, the
terminal near the cut is its cathode. There are also LED’s that emit red, yellow,
green, blue colors as well as infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) rays in the market.

In the early stages light emitting diodes were mostly used as indicators. At present,
light emitting diodes are also used in the construction of large television screens.
With the invention of white light LED’s, their use is becoming increasingly popular
for lighting up homes, streets and in the construction of torches. The very low
power consumption, and the long life times of about 50,000 hours are the reasons
for the wide usage of light emitting diodes.

11.4.6 Solar Cells
Solar cells are also constructed using p-n junctions. Therefore solar cells are also
diodes. They are constructed in such a manner so as to allow light to fall on the
junction. When sunlight is incident on these silicon p-n junctions, a small electro
motive force (voltage) is generated across the junction. Since such a p-n junction
can be used as a source of an electro motive force, they are known as solar cells.
By arranging a number of such cells in series and parallel, voltages such as 12 V
or 15 V with large currents can be obtained. Such an arrangement is known as a
solar panel.
Originally such solar panels were developed for the use satellites. They were used
instead of batteries to generate electricity. Their cost at that time was very high.
Since they can now be produced at a low cost with the development of technology,
solar panels are used to light up homes at present.

Solar cells are considered to be a solution to the future power and energy crisis as
they operate with the solar radiation we receive at no cost, as they do not emit any
substance that is harmful to the environment and as they have a long lifetime (the
solar cells produced initially are still in operation).
Solar cells are presently used to operate clocks and calculators and they are also
used in solar powered motor vehicles.
11.5 Transistors
The transistor which is responsible for vast developments in electronics is
constructed using two p-n junctions. Three semiconductor regions of type p and n
are connected together to form a transistor. There are only two ways in which the
three semiconductor regions can be connected in order to form two p-n junctions.
Figure 11.24 shows these two ways. They are known as npn and pnp transistors

Three terminals, one from each of the three semiconductor regions protrude from
the transistor. When the transistor is operating, carriers (electrons or holes) are
emitted from one of the semiconductor regions at the two ends while the other
one collects the carriers. Therefore, the two terminals at the ends are known as
the emitter and the collector. The terminal at the middle can control the carriers
flowing from the emitter to the collector and it is known as the base.
In figures, the three first letters of the three words E, C and B are used to indicate the
respective terminals. Structure of a transistor direction of carries and the direction
of current are shown in the figure 11.25(a). The standard symbols used to represent

² Carriers always flow from the emitter to the collector.
²
Since the carriers of a p-type semiconductor are holes (corresponding to a +
charge) the current flow in a pnp transistor is from the emitter to the collector
(arrow head towards the interior).
Since the carriers of an n-type semiconductor are electrons, the current flow
in an npn transistor is from the collector to the emitter (arrow head towards
the exterior).
²
When using a transistor in a circuit, appropriate voltages must be provided to the
terminals. This is known as biasing a transistor. The emitter – base junction
should be forward biased while the base collector junction should be reverse biased
with a higher voltage.
For this a voltage should be supplied to the terminals C and E in the direction of
current shown by the arrow head.
Accordingly, in a npn transistor, C should be connected to the positive (+) terminal
and E should the connected to the negative (–) terminal because current always flow
from positive to negative. In a pnp transistor E should be connected to the positive
terminal while the C should be connected to the negative (–) terminal. B should
be supplied a potential difference in the same direction as C but with a smaller
magnitude. Then, the base (B) - collector (C) junction becomes reverse biased.

●
In all the circuits we discuss in the ordinary level syllabus, we use only npn
transistors.
There are a large number of various types of transistors in the market and they are
constructed with various different outward appearances. In order to identify these
transistors they are coded with numbers.

current flow is small if the brightness of the bulbs are low and that the current flow
is large if the brightness of the bulbs are high.
We can draw the following conclusions from the activity above.
² A current flows in the output circuit only when a current flows in the input
circuit.
² Even when a voltage is given to the output circuit, a current does not flow in
the output circuit unless there is a current flowing in the input circuit.
² When a small current flows in the input (when L1 lights up with a low brightness)
a large current flows in the output (L2 lights up with a higher brightness). (The
input current is known as the base current IB and the output current is known
as the collector current IC).
² A small current IB in the input can be amplified into a large current IC in the
output using a transistor. This is the process known as current amplification.
● Signal Amplifier

amplifier. How a transistor can be used to amplify an audio frequency signal is

² Observe that the bulb begins to light up when the voltmeter reading is about
0.7 V and the bulb has the maximum brightness when the voltage is about
0.8 V.
We can draw the following conclusions from the above activity.
² When the voltage difference between the emitter and the base is less than
0.7 V, there is no collector current Ic.
² When the voltage difference between the emitter and the base is about 0.7 V,
the collector current begins to flow.
² When the voltage difference between the emitter and the base exceeds 0.7 V,
(about 0.8 V), the collector current reaches a maximum.
² Therefore, when the voltage difference between B-E terminals is less than
0.7 V, the transistor acts as an open switch (off) and the voltage difference
between the B-E terminals exceeds 0.7 V, it acts as a closed switch (on).

Let us engage in activity 11.6 to demonstrate how to design a switch circuit that
automatically lights up when darkness falls using the above principle.
Here we will use a light dependent resistor (LDR) as the light sensor. When light
is incident on its front surface, its resistance becomes very low (of the order of 1 Ω)
while in the dark it has a very high resistance (of the order of 100 kΩ).

● In the activity 11.6, the VR acts as a variable resistor and the LDR as a potential

● By keeping R1 constant and varying R2, any potential from 0 to 3 V can be

0.7 =

= 3 × R2

= 2.3 R2
∴ R2
=
7000 = 3043 Ω

Therefore when R2 is 3043 Ω, the potential at B becomes 0.7 V.
● When the resistance of the LDR increases upto 3043 Ω by decreasing the
light incident on it, the bulb dimly lights up and when the light is further
decreased, the potential increases upto 0.7 V and the current Ic increases to a
maximum (Switch opens).

Summary
Electronics
Physics
Electronics
● The charge carriers that conduct electricity in metallic conductors are the
●
negatively charged electrons.
In semiconductors, both electrons and holes (corresponding to a positive
charge) act as carriers that conduct electricity.
● Since a hole is formed in a semiconductor when a bond breaks releasing an
electron, the number of free carrier electrons in the semiconductor is equal
the number of holes in it.
● Therefore when a potential difference is applied across a semiconductor,
holes move from the positive to the negative potential while the electrons
move from the negative to the positive potential and the (standard) current
flows from the positive to the negative potential.
● An n-type extrinsic semiconductor can be formed by doping an intrinsic
semiconductor with a group V element.
● A p-type extrinsic semiconductor can be formed by doping an intrinsic
semiconductor with a group III element.
● When an external potential difference is applied across a p-n junction so as
to make the p region negative, the depletion region broadens and no current
flows across the junction. This is known as “reverse bias”.
● When an external potential difference is applied across a p-n junction so as
to make the p region positive, the depletion region thins down if the external
potential difference is sufficiently large to mate the potential barrier, then a
current flows across the junction. This is known as “forward bias”.
● Diodes can be used for the rectification of an alternating current.
● The potential barrier across a p-n junction for a Si junction is about 0.7 V
and for a Ge junction about 0.3 V.
● Since charge carriers in a p-type semiconductor are holes (corresponding to
a positive charge), in a pnp transistor, the current flows from the emitter to
the collector (inward arrow head).
● Since charge carriers in a n-type semiconductor are electrons, in a npn
transistor, the current flows from the collector to the emitter (outward arrow
head).
● Always, carriers flow from the emitter to the collector.
● A transistor can be used as a simple current amplifier, signal (ac) amplifier
and a switch.

Here, it can be observed that, gas bubbles are liberated near the zinc strip and the
zinc strip dissolves gradually. Let us find the reasons for those observations.
Zinc atoms (Zn) go into the solution as zinc ions (Zn2+) leaving electrons on the
metal. Electrons get accumulated on the zinc strip. This process can be shown as
follows using chemical symbols.

Sulphuric acid dissociates into hydrogen ions (H+) and sulphate ions (SO 2-)
water. This can be illustrated as follows.

The H+ ions in the solution are attracted towards the zinc strip to capture the
electrons on it. Hydrogen ions, after receiving the electrons become hydrogen gas
(H2). Using chemical symbols, this can be written as follows.
2H+(aq) + 2e

The reactions written as 1 and 2 above, depicting the conversion of one
chemical species into another, either by removing or accepting electrons, are called
'half reactions'. By adding two half reactions appropriately, the balanced ionic
equation can be obtained.

equation. The hydrogen ions (H+) were added to the solution by the dissociation of
2-) are
sulphuric acid (H2SO4). When sulphuric acid dissociates sulphate ions (SO4
also added to the medium in addition to H+ ions. But sulphate ions do not undergo

Given above is the complete reaction for which zinc metal reacts with dilute
sulphuric acid. If the exchange of electrons taking place between the zinc metal
and H+ ions during the above process occurs through an external conductor, we can
produce an electric current.
Let us do the following activity to see whether this can be done.

dissolved and gas bubbles are evolved at the copper strip.
Let us explore the reasons for these observations.
Here too, zinc atoms become zinc ions (Zn2+) leaving electrons on the metal.
Therefore, the zinc strip dissolves.

The electrons accumulated on the zinc strip, flow towards the copper strip through
an external wire. This flow of electrons is considered an electric current. Deflection
of the Ammeter shows that an electric current flows through the circuit. Hence
in this set up, H+ ions in the solution move toward the copper strip and receive
electrons from it. Therefore, hydrogen gas bubbles are liberated at the copper strip.

In the above reaction it was confirmed that an electron current flows from zinc to
copper in the external wire. A current of electrons means an electric current. In this,
a chemical reaction has generated an electric current. A set up of this kind used to
generate electricity by a chemical reaction is known as an electrochemical cell. The
conducting substances dipped in the electrolyte here are called electrodes.
In the above cell, zinc strip and copper strip act as electrodes. The balanced
ionic equation obtained by adding the half reactions 1 and 2 above is the
electrochemical reaction taking place in the cell.

Zn2+(aq)+ H2 (g)
Let us further consider the reaction occurring at the zinc electrode in the above cell.
Zn (s)
Zn2+(aq)+ 2e

Loss of electrons from a given species (atoms, molecules or ions) is referred to as
oxidation. Therefore, what is happening at the zinc strip is oxidation. If oxidation
occurs at a certain electrode, that electrode is defined as the anode. Accordingly,
the zinc strip is the anode of the above cell. Equation 1 represents the oxidation
half reaction taking place at the anode. Since zinc atoms dissolve into the solution
leaving electrons on the zinc plate, the zinc plate gets negatively charged relative
to the copper plate. Therefore, zinc electrode is the negative terminal of the cell.
Next let us consider the reaction occurring at the copper strip.
2H+(aq) + 2e
H2(g)

The hydrogen ions (H+) gaining electrons turn into hydrogen gas molecules (H2).
Gaining electrons by a given species (atoms, molecules, ions) is described as a
reduction. Since gaining of electrons or a reduction occurs at the copper electrode,
reaction 2 is the reduction half reaction.

If reduction occurs at a certain electrode, it is defined as the cathode. Therefore,
copper strip is the cathode of the cell. Since electrons flow to the copper strip, it
is positively charged relative to the zinc strip. Therefore, copper electrode is the
positive terminal of the cell.
The electrochemical reaction of the cell can be obtained by adding the reactions
1 and 2 .

placed lower in the activity series acts as the cathode.

Since iron atoms dissolve into the solution leaving electrons on the iron strip, it is
negatively charged relative to copper. Thus, iron electrode is the negative terminal
of the cell.
In this cell also, the following reduction half reaction occurs at the less reactive
copper metal. Therefore, copper electrode acts as the cathode of this cell.

Electrons flow to the copper electrode across the external wire. Therefore, copper

jewellery shops in town.
If you have not seen such a person, make it a point to observe well the equipment
he has, when you meet such a person next time. You may be able to see a battery
supplying electricity, wires connected to it and a vessel filled with a certain solution.
He uses a narrow gold foil as one electrode and the piece of jewellery that needs
to be polished as the other electrode. What he does with these equipment is the
application of gold on the piece of jewellery.
Using the above process, he deposits gold on various jewellery. He lets an electric
current to pass through the solution.
The chemical changes brought about by passing electricity through a solution/liquid
which conduct electricity are called electrolytic processes. This chapter discusses
about electrolysis. For this, let us first do the following activity to find out about the
liquids/solutions which conduct electricity.

The solid ionic crystals formed by the oppositely charged ions do not
contain mobile ions. Therefore they cannot conduct electricity. But,
when they are dissolved in water or fused (heated till the solid melts)
its ions become mobile. For this reason, aqueous solutions or molten
liquids of ionic compounds conduct electricity. The hydrocarbons
such as petrol, kerosene and paraffin are compounds with covalent
bonds, so they do not conduct electricity. Pure water is also covalent
and there are almost no ions. Therefore, pure water does not conduct
electricity. In aqueous solution, the covalent bonds in acids such as
hydroiodic acid (HI), hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sulphuric acid
(H2SO4) break to form ions. Therefore the solutions of acids such as
these conduct electricity.

Figure 12.2.2 - An electrolytic cell.
Let us consider the supply of electricity to an electrolytic cell containing an aqueous
solution of sodium chloride as the electrolyte. Liberation of gas bubbles can be seen
at the carbon electrodes. This indicates that a chemical change has taken place in
the aqueous solution.
Bringing about a generally non-spontaneous chemical reaction such as the one
given above by supplying electricity is known as electrolysis.
² Conventions adopted in electrolysis
(1) The electrode connected to the positive terminal of the external electrical supply
(battery) is the positive electrode whereas the electrode connected to the negative
terminal is the negative electrode.
(2) The positive ions in the solution/liquid migrate towards the negative electrode
while the negative ions are attracted by the positive electrode.
(3) The positive ions moving towards the negative electrode receive electrons and
undergo reduction. If there are several positive ions in the solution, generally,
the cations (positive ions) formed by the elements further down in the activity
series has a higher tendency to undergo reduction.
For example, if there are Na+ and H+ ions in the solution, the H+ ions
formed by hydrogen which is below sodium in the activity series receive
electrons and get reduced.
If there are Cu2+ and H+ ions in the solution electrons are gained by
the Cu2+ ions formed by copper which is placed below hydrogen in the
activity series.

(4) Since a reduction half reaction occurs at the negative electrode, negative
electrode is the cathode.
(5) The anions (negative ions) in the solution move towards the positive electrode
and lose electrons. That means, they undergo oxidation.
For example, the Cl- ions in the solution become Cl2 molecules releasing
electrons.
2Cl- (aq)
Cl2 (g) + 2 e
(When there are several negative ions in the solution, which ion oxidizes first is
decided by several factors. Since these facts are beyond the scope of your subject
they are not discussed here).
(6) Oxidation occurs at the positive electrode, so positive electrode is the anode.
(7) If a metal (except platinum) is used as the anode, metal atoms get oxidized
losing electrons instead of the oxidation of negative ions.
For example, if the anode is a silver rod, the oxidation reaction
Ag (s)
Ag+ (aq) + e takes place at the positive electrode.
Based on the above conventions, let us predict the reactions taking place during the
following electrolysis reactions.

Accordingly, the negative electrode is the cathode.
² Reaction occurring at the positive electrode

positive electrode. At this electrode, Cl- ions get converted to chlorine molecules
(Cl2) by removing electrons.

Cl2 (g) + 2e
Since chloride ions are oxidized by losing electrons, this is the anodic reaction.

² Reaction at the negative electrode (cathodic reaction)
Chemistry
Na+ and H+ ions in the solution migrate towards the negative electrode.
As hydrogen is below sodium in the activity series, it is the H+ ions that are reduced
here.
2H+ (aq) + 2e
H2 (g)

As this is a reduction occurring with the gain of electrons, the negative electrode is
the cathode.
Therefore reaction 1 is the cathodic reaction. Hence gas bubbles of hydrogen
(H2) are evolved at the negative terminal.
² Reaction at the positive electrode (anodic reaction)
The positive terminal attract Cl- and OH- ions in the solution. Of them, Cl- ions have
a greater tendency to oxidize.
2Cl- (aq)
Cl2 (g) + 2e
2
As this is an oxidation (because it involves loss of electrons) reaction 2 is the
anodic reaction.
Hence chlorine gas bubbles (Cl2) evolve at the positive electrode.
The overall electrolytic reaction can be obtained from the reactions 1 and 2
1 + 2 2e + 2H+ (aq) + 2Cl- (aq)
2 H+ (aq) + 2Cl- (aq)
H2 (g) + Cl2 (g) + 2e
H2 (g) + Cl2 (g)
Initially the ions Na+, H+, Cl- and OH- were present in the solution. Of these, the
ions H+ and Cl- are removed by the conversion into H2 and Cl2 molecules. Hence
Na+ and OH- ions are left in the solution. Because of this you may understand that
this reaction can be used to produce sodium hydroxide (NaOH).

² Reaction at the negative electrode

Hence, copper is deposited on the cathode. As this is a reduction, reaction 1 is the
cathodic reaction. Thus, negative electrode is the cathode. As Cu2+ ions responsible
for the blue colour of the solution are removed from the solution, the intensity of
the blue colour of the solution decreases.

these, OH- ions have a greater tendency to be oxidized.

Therefore, oxygen gas bubbles evolve at the anode.
Reaction 2 is an oxidation, so it is the anodic reaction. Hence, positive electrode
is the anode.
F o r y o u r m e m o r y fi l e
² Since the amount of H+ ions in water is negligible, sometimes the reaction
2OH-
2H2O (l) + 2e
is considered the more fitting cathodic reaction than
2H+ (aq) + 2e

Fused sodium chloride is used as the raw material. The melting temperature of
solid sodium chloride is as high as 840 0C. By adding about 40% calcium chloride
to sodium chloride, the meling temperature of the mixture is decreased to about
600 0C.
What will happen is chlorine gas produced at the anode comes into contact with the
sodium discharged at the cathode. Sodium and chlorine would react giving sodium
chloride again. To prevent this, the anode and cathode are separated by a steel mesh
diaphragm. It prevents the reaction between sodium and chlorine to form sodium
chloride.
In this production process, chlorine gas is obtained as a by - product. Chlorine gas
can also be used as a raw material for various products.
Uses of sodium
² Used in sodium vapour lamps which emit a yellow light.
² Used as a coolant in nuclear reactors in power houses producing nuclear energy
² It is a requirement for laboratory experiments
Uses of chlorine
² Chlorine is bubbled through water to destroy bacteria in potable water.
² Used to bleach (decolourise) paper, pulp, and cloth
²
Production of hydrochloric acid by reacting with hydrogen
² Used to produce plastics such as PVC
² Electroplating
At the beginning of this lesson, it was stated that electroplating is used to coat
jewellery with gold. In addition to that, think about the ornamental objects used to
decorate houses. In many items such as vases, trays and door locks that shine with
golden or silvery colour, the metallic lustre is given by a metal coating deposited
on them.
Applying a thin metallic layer on a given surface using electrolysis is referred to as
electroplating.
Generally the coating is a less reactive metal such as tin, copper, silver or chromium.
The metal that is plated needs to have a certain special property which is absent

for the surface that is plated. Resistance for rusting, attractive colour, chemical
inertness and lustrous nature are some of such properties.
When electroplating objects, it is important to know the following.
²
The object to be plated should be used as the cathode.
² A solution of a salt of the metal that is used for plating should be used as the
electrolyte.
²
²
The anode should be a plate/ rod made of the metal that is plated.
In order to have a plating of high quality, the concentration of the electrolyte
should be low. Then, the rate of the reaction decreases, so the plating is effected
better.
Suppose you need to coat an iron spoon with copper. What do you use as the
anode and cathode of the electrolytic cell which you construct for this? What is the
electrolyte you employ?
The object to be plated, that is the iron spoon has to be used as the cathode. A
copper rod can be used as the anode. A solution of copper sulphate can be used as
the electrolyte.
Activity 12.2.5
Materials required :- An iron spoon, a copper plate, connecting wires, an aqueous
solution of copper sulphate, a 9 V battery

2-
4 and OH- ions in the solution migrate towards the anode. Of them OH- ions
SO
preferentially tend to undergo oxidation. Therefore, it can be anticipated that the
reaction 4 OH- (aq)
2H2O (l) + O2 (g) + 4e occurs at the anode. However,
it does not occur at the anode. As the anode is a metal, oxidation of metal atoms into
metal ions is more feasible. Hence, the anodic reaction is
Cu2+ (aq) + 2e
Cu (s)
That means, the anode dissolves gradually.
² Cathodic (negative electrode) reaction
The solution contains Cu2+ ions and a little amount of H+ ions produced by the
dissociation of water. Of these, Cu2+ ion which is less in reactivity shows a greater
tendency to be reduced. Therefore, the cathodic reaction is the following.
+ 2e
Cu2+ (aq)
As a result, the cathode (iron spoon) gets coated with copper.

12.3 Corrosion of metals
Think about various metal objects that are used at home. With time, most of them
are subjected to changes such as tarnishing, surface turning ditted and colour
change. Subjecting metals to changes such as these when exposed to air is known
as corrosion of metals.
Try to remind an instance where you relocated a lost item such as a knife or a
mammoty blade after a long time in the garden. You would have observed that they
are discoloured and decayed. Such objects are made of iron or steel. Corrosion of
iron or steel exposed to air is specifically known as rusting.
12.3.1 Rusting of iron
Iron is the metal mostly used by humans. Therefore, it is the metal produced in the
largest quantity. Iron manufactured is largley used to produce steel. Iron and steel
are used to make vehicles, ships, bridges, machinery and many other products.
Hence, rusting of iron is an economically disadvantageous process.
What kind of a process occurs when iron rusts ?
Why do the equipment made up of iron rust more easily outdoors rather than when
they are indoors? Do the following activity to investigate into this

Activity 12.3.1
Materials required :- Two boiling tubes, ordinary cold water, coconut oil, two
iron nails, burner, dilute hydrochloric acid
Method :-
² The iron nails available in the market has a zinc coating on them. To remove
this, keep the two nails immersed in dilute hydrochloric acid for about 10
minutes and then wash with water. (Always use this procedure for experiment
used the iron nail)
² Add cold water about half the height of the two boiling tubes.
² Boil the water in one of the boiling tube for about five minutes. Immerse the
cleaned nails one each in the two boiling tubes. Add a little amount of coconut
oil to the boiling tube with hot water to prevent the entry of atmospheric air.
Allow the boiling tubes to stand for about two days and observe. Note down
the observations.

The nails in the above two tubes are in contact with water. But, as the water in the
tube B is boiled, air dissolved in it has been removed. Because of the coconut
oil layer, water in tube B does not come into contact with air, so the nail in B
doesn't receive air. The nail in tube A received air (dissolved in water). All the
other factors are common to the two settings.
It can be observed that the nail in tube A has rusted but the nail in tube B has not
rusted. This confirms that air is essential for rusting.
Next, let us investigate which components in air are essential for rusting.

You can notice that the water level in the tube with iron wool has risen
approximately up to 1/5th of the total volume of air inside the tube. Hence a part
of air has been used for rusting. By composition, 1/5th of the volume of air is
oxygen. Thus it can be concluded that it is the oxygen gas in air that is required for
rusting. The gas required for rusting is oxygen.

anhydrous calcium chloride can absorb water vapour in air.
In the above experiment, it can be observed that in the two nails in tube A , the
parts inside and outside the tube have rusted. However, in the case of B , in the
two nails, only the parts of the nails which are outside the tube have undergone
rusting. As regards the tubes A and B are compared we note that tube B does
not have water vapour in it. Other factors are common to both tubes. This shows
that water is a requirement for rusting.
Next let us get on to the process taking place during rusting.
Iron atoms form positive ions by losing electrons. This means that they get
oxidised. It can be represented by an equation as follows.
Fe (s)
Fe2+ (aq) + 2e

103

Metal atoms oxidise as above only when there is another species which can accept
electrons.
When oxygen gas in the atmosphere and water/ water vapour are together, they get
reduced accepting electrons as indicated below.
2H2O (l) + O2 (g) + 4e
4OH- (aq)

Accordingly, the half reactions occuring when iron rusts can be given as follows.
Fe2+ (aq) + 2e
4OH- (aq)
Fe (s)

Therefore, it is clear that what occurs in rusting also is an electrochemical pro-
cess similar to what you studied in the sub-unit 2.6. It can be stated that reaction
1 is the anodic reaction (because oxidation occurs) and reaction 2 is cathodic
reaction (because reduction occurs).
Fe(OH)2, formed above further reacts with air to form hydrated ferric oxide
(Fe2O3 . H2O)
4Fe (OH)2 (s) + O2 (g)
2(Fe2O3 . H2O) (s) + 2H2O (l)
Hydrated ferric oxide is reddish brown in colour. As the number of water molecules
combining with ferric oxide during hydration may vary, the formula of rust can be
more appropriately given as Fe2O3 . xH2O.

It can be observed that the nail in the tube with ordinary water has rusted and
relative to this, the nail in sodium hydroxide solution has not rusted much. This
confirms that bases decrease the speed of rusting.
The speedy corrosion of iron which is a very useful metal is a disadvantage.
Therefore, steps must be taken to control the corrosion of objects made of iron.
12.3.2 Control of rusting of iron
What are the methods you suggest to prevent the corrosion of iron? In order to
protect iron from corrosion you may propose that it is appropriate to prevent iron
from coming into contact with the essential factors for rusting. In fact, if oxygen
and water are kept away from iron, rusting can be prevented.
For this, following measures can be adopted.
1) Applying paint, grease or oil on iron
This prevents iron from coming into contact with oxygen and water (moisture)
2) Coating iron with tin
This too prevents impinging of oxygen and water (moisture) on iron.

In the presence of OH- ions, phenolphthalein indicator turns pink.
³ Fe2+ ions indicate a blue colour with potassium ferricyanide.
In the petri dishes 2 and 3 above pink colour is seen around the iron nails. That
means, OH- ions are formed near the iron nail. Absence of blue colour show
that Fe2+ ions have not formed. In the petri dishes 2 and 3, the iron nails are in
contact with magnesium and zinc which are more reactive than iron. Hence, cathodic
reaction has occured at the iron nails.

The Mg2+ and Zn2+ ions formed do not give a colour with potassium ferricyanide
in the medium.
Appearnce of blue colour around the iron nails in the petri dishes 4 and 5 indicates
the formation of Fe2+ ions. This shows that the iron nails in them have corroded. In
these set ups, iron acts as the anode and is subjected to oxidation as follows.
Fe (s)
Fe2+ (aq) + 2e
Copper and lead are placed below iron in the activity series. When iron is in contact
with such a metal, iron rusts faster. Areas around copper and lead strips turning
pink indicates the formation of OH- ions closer to them. Therefore, the following
reaction should have occured at copper or lead.
2H2O (l) + O2 (g) + 4e
4 OH- (aq)
According to the above observations it would be clear to you that in order to
protect iron from corrosion, a metal above iron in the activity series can be kept in
contact with iron. Then, iron acts as the cathode and is protected from corrosion.
Protecting iron by making it the cathode of an electrochemical cell is known as the
cathodic protection or sacrificial protection.
Instances where cathode protection is used:
² Coating iron objects with zinc (galvanizing)- buckets, barbed wire, roofing
sheets, GI pipes
² Welding blocks of magnesium and zinc to the hulls of the ships sailing in the
sea (These blocks of magnesium and zinc should be replaced from time to time)

Summary
Chemistry
Chemistry
² Electrochemical cells are used to convert chemical energy to electrical
energy.
² A simple cell can be made by connecting two different metal rods by
²
conducting wires and immersing them in an acid solution.
In a simple electrochemical cell, the more reactive metal acts as the anode
and the less reactive metal acts as the cathode.
² An oxidation half reaction occurs at the anode while a reduction half reaction
occurs at the cathode.
² Anode is the negative terminal and cathode is the positive terminal of an
electrochemical cell.
² Along the external wire, electrons flow from the anode to cathode.
² The conventional current is considered to flow from the positive terminal
(cathode) to negative terminal (anode).
² Electrolysis causes chemical changes in matter by passing an electric current
²
through a solution or a liquid.
In electrolysis, electricity is passed through the solution or a liquid by
immersing two carbon or metal electrodes in it, to which an external electrical
supply is connected.
² The solution /liquid through which electricity is passed is called the electrolyte.
To conduct electricity there should be mobile ions in the electrolyte.
² Since the positive terminal of the electrolytic cell acts as the anode, an
oxidation half reaction occurs at the positive terminal.
² Manufacturing of useful substances from the products discharged at the
²
electrodes is an industrial application of electrolysis.
Industrially, sodium metal is obtained by the electrolysis of fused sodium
chloride. Hydrogen and chlorine gases obtained as by-products of this are
also useful chemicals.
² Subjecting the surface of a metal to chemcial changes when it is exposed to
atomsphere and moisture is known as the corrosion of the metal.
² Subjecting iron and steel to corrosion as above is specifically known as
rusting.
² Oxygen gas and moisture are indispensable for the rusting of iron.
² Corrosion of iron is an electrochemical process.

² By further oxidation of Fe(OH)2 , hydrated ferric oxide (Fe2O3. x H2O) or rust
is formed.
² Salts such as sodium chloride and acids speed up rusting.
² Bases decrease the rate of rusting.
² Rusting can be prevented by keeping iron without coming into contact with
oxygen and moisture, the essential conditions for rusting.
² For this, iron can be coated with a protective layer of paint, grease or tin metal.
² When a metal more reactive than iron is in contact with iron, rusting is reduced
because the reactive metal acts as the anode and iron acts as the cathode. This
is called sacrificial protection or cathodic protection.
² Galvanizing iron is an example for sacrifical protection.

13.1 Magnetism
Figure 13.1 shows the use of a large electromagnet to lift and remove scrap iron and
steel. Since iron and steel pieces are attracted towards this strong electromagnet, it
is easy to move them using this method.
Figure 13.1 – Use of an electromagnet to remove scrap iron and steel
There are two main types of magnets known as electromagnets and permanent
magnets. In electromagnets, magnetism exists only while a current is passing
through the coil of the electromagnet. In permanent magnets, magnetism is a
characteristic of the material of the magnet and it remains in the magnet permanently.
Both types of magnets are used in many instruments for various purposes. Magnets
are used in controlling most domestic appliances and robots by electric motors, in
applications involving magnetic cards, in medical equipment such as MRI machines
and in various other scientific and technological instruments. Therefore, it is useful
to have a good knowledge about the behaviour, operation and applications of
magnets.

Objects made of magnetic materials such as iron, steel, nickel are attracted by
magnets. Objects made of materials such as plastic, wood, paper and rubber are not
attracted by magnets.
13.1.1 Magnetic Field
Around any magnet, there is a region within which the magnet has an influence.
This region is known as the magnetic field. A magnetic field is not perceptible
to the eye. Therefore we cannot see a magnetic field. However, it can influence
another magnet or a moving charge. It has been found that some animals such as
birds use the earth’s magnetic field for navigation.
One way of determining whether there is a magnetic field in a certain region is
to use a compass. A compass is a small light-weight magnet mounted on a pivot
in such way that it could rotate freely around the pivot. In the absence of any
magnetic influence other than the earth’s magnetic field, a compass aligns along the
north-south direction. Let us engage in activity 13.1 to investigate the field near to
a bar magnet.
Activity 13.1
Apparatus required: A compass, a piece of glass, A piece of iron, A magnet, A
piece of plastic, a piece of brass
² Place the compass on a table and observe the deflection
of its indicator by bringing close to it, a piece of glass,
a piece of iron, a magnet, a piece of plastic and a piece
of brass one at a time.

Naturally occurring magnets have been known to man as far back as thousands
of years. The compass was invented by Chinese in the eleventh century AD.
When a compass is placed at a point in a region where a magnetic field exists, the
direction of the compass needle shows the direction of the magnetic field at that
point. This direction can vary from point to point. In addition, the strength of the
magnetic field can also vary from point to point. Therefore, a magnetic field is a
physical quantity with a magnitude and a direction.

13.2 Magnetic Effect of a Current
When an electric current flows through an electric
conductor, a magnetic field is created in the vicinity of
the conductor. Danish scientist Hans Christine Oersted
was the first to observe a magnetic effect in the vicinity
of a current carrying conductor.
Let us now engage in activity 13.2 to observe a magnetic effect (field) due to a
straight conductor carrying a current.

The indicator deflects only when it is subjected to the influence of a magnetic effect.
That is, in the presence of a magnetic field. This activity would show you that a
magnetic field is created when a current flows through a conductor.
It will be clear to you from the above activity that the direction of the magnetic field
in the vicinity of a current carrying conductor depends on the direction of the current
flow.

13.2.1 Direction of the Magnetic Field due to a Current through a
Straight Conductor
Let us now investigate about two rules that could be used to find the direction of the
magnetic field due to a current flowing through a straight conductor.
² Maxwell’s corkscrew rule
Maxwell’s corkscrew rule can be used to find the direction of the magnetic field due
to a current flowing through a conductor.
When a corkscrew is rotated in such a way that its tip moves in the direction of
current flow, then the magnetic field lines produced by the current are in the direction
of rotation of the corkscrew.
A corkscrew is an instrument used to open bottles with cork lids. Normal screws
show the same behavior as corkscrews.
^a& According to Figure 13.10 (a), when a current flows from A to B, the direction
of the resulting magnetic field is anti-clockwise.
^b& According to Figure 13.10 (b), when a current flows from B to A, the direction
of the resulting magnetic field is clockwise.

If the conductor is held with the right hand in such a way that the thumb is

13.2.2 Force Acting on a Current Carrying Conductor Placed in a
Magnetic Field
You have learnt that a magnetic field is established in the vicinity of a conductor that
carries a current. Let us now engage in Activity 13.3 in order to find out whether a

² Place the U-magnet on a table and place the two brass rods as shown in the figure
by inserting them through two holes pierced in the thick card board. Connect the
two dry cells and the switch S to the ends A and D of the brass rods.
² Next place the conductor BC on the two brass rods between the north and
south poles of the magnet.
² Allow a current to flow by closing the switch S. Then a current flows from
the cells through the brass rods along the direction AB and through the
conductor in the direction BC and reaches the cell from the direction CD.
² When the current flows, you will observe that the conductor BC moves along
the brass rods away from the magnet (to the right hand side).
² Now repeat the above step by changing the cell terminals to change the
direction of the current. Now you will observe that the conductor BC moves
along the brass rods towards the magnet (to the left hand side).
² Repeat the above step after changing the top and bottom poles of the magnet.
You will observe that the direction of motion of the conductor BC is opposite
to that of the above steps.
A conductor placed in a magnetic field moves when a current flows through the
conductor as a result of a force acting on it. The direction of the force is indicated
by the direction of motion of the conductor.
In the activity above, the direction of the magnetic field and the direction of the
current through the conductor have been arranged to be perpendicular to each other.
You will be able to observe that the motion of the conductor takes place in a direction
perpendicular to both of the above directions.

The magnitude of the resulting force depends on the following three factors.
² The magnitude of the current through the conductor
² The length of the conductor between the rods
² The strength of the magnetic field
The force increases as the above three factors are increased and it decreases when
the above three factors are decreased. That is, the force is directly proportional to
the three factors given above.
• Fleming’s left hand rule
Fleming’s left hand rule can be used to find the direction of the force acting on a
conductor placed in a magnetic field when a current flows through the conductor.
Keep the thumb, index finger and the middle finger of the left hand perpendicular
to one another and point the middle finger in the direction of the current flow
and the index finger along the direction of the magnetic field. Then the direction
pointed by the thumb will be the direction of the force acting on the conductor.

The action of a force on a current carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field
is a very useful phenomenon in our daily lives. Electric motors, loud speakers,
galvanometers, voltmeters and ammeters (analog) are some of the instruments
constructed based on this phenomenon.
13.2.3 Loud Speaker
Figure 13.15 shows the outward appearance and the cross section of a loud speaker.
A loud speaker generates a sound when a current that varies according to the wave
form of the sound is allowed to pass through the coil in the loud speaker.
The main components of a loud speaker are a light-weight cardboard cone, a
conducting coil and a ring-magnet. The end of the cone with the larger diameter
and the magnet are fixed to a supporting metal frame as shown in Figure 13.15(b).

The coil is connected to the end of the cone with the smaller diameter in such a way
as to allow the coil to freely move forward and backward in the region between the
poles of the magnet. When a time-varying current flows through the coil, the force
exerted on the conductor by the magnet vibrates the coil forward and backward
according the variation of the current and the cone too vibrates accordingly,
generating sound waves.

Activity 13.4
Apparatus required: A dry cell, insulated copper wires, two needles with large
holes, some clay, cello tape, A knife for cutting wires, A
small (ring) magnet.
² First construct the magnetic coil. In order to do this, wrap about 30 windings
of the copper wire around a cylindrical object such as a somewhat large pen,
starting from the middle of the wire. Wind the free ends of the wire several
times around the coil to prevent it from unwinding.
² Use the knife to remove the insulation of the wire as shown in figure 18 near
the free ends. Removal of the insulation should only be done in about half
of the wire and on the same side at each end.
² Next, pass the two ends through the needle holes and mount the coil on the
needles horizontally as shown in figure 3.

it a slight push with your hand. Then it will start rotating.

In this case too, the magnetic field exerts a force on the conductor when a current
flows through it. Since the conductor in this case is a coil, two forces act on the
coil in two opposite directions (a couple) as shown in figure 6 causing it to rotate.

The reason for removing the insulation in only one side of the coil at the two ends
is to prevent a current from flowing through the coil in the second half a cycle
(after the first half cycle). Otherwise, the couple will act in the opposite direction
in the second half cycle as shown in figure 7 and the coil will tend to rotate in the
opposite direction. If however the current is prevented from flowing in the second
half cycle, the coil will continue to rotate in the same direction during the second
half cycle too in the first half cycle.
● Main parts of the DC motor
Armature
In normal DC motors, there is a coil much like the coil
you used in the previous activity. Since a motor is used
to rotate some load, the coil of a DC motor must be
strong enough to withstand an external load. Therefore
the coil is wrapped around a steel or iron core as shown
in the figure 13.17. This coil, together with the core, is
known as the armature.
Figure 13.17 - Armature
The function of the armature is to give rise to a rotation by generating a couple
when a current is passing through it.
Magnetic Poles
A magnetic field is required to exert a force on a coil
when a current flows through the coil. In normal DC
motors this magnetic field is obtained by poles of a
permanent magnet arranged around the armature as
shown in the figure 13.18.
Figure 13.18- Magnetic Poles
Commutator
In the motor you constructed, the insulation was removed only on one side of
the wire near the ends. That was because the coil would rotate in two opposite
directions if the insulation is completely removed. Therefore, in your motor, the
current flows through the coil only in one half of each cycle. When the current flows
only during half a cycle, the load that the motor can rotate is restricted. Therefore a
more suitable way for the current to flow would be to let the current to flow in one
direction during half of a rotation cycle and to let the current to flow in the opposite
direction in the next half cycle. A commutator is used to alternate the direction of
current flow in this manner.

The commutator consists of two metallic split rings and two parts known as brushes
that can be adjusted to brush against the split rings as shown in the figure 13.19.
The two ends of the coil are connected to the two split rings and they rotate with
the armature. The two brushes maintain contact with the split rings without rotating
themselves. These two brushes are connected to the external circuit that provides
current to the motor.
● Operation of a DC Motor
Figure 13.20 shows the appearance of a
motor with all of the above components
assembled together. Figure 13.21 shows
a simplified figure that can be used to
understand the operation of the motor
easily. In the Figure 13.21 the coil of the
motor is shown by a single loop ABCD.
This coil is placed between two magnetic
poles. The coil is connected to the split
rings X and Y while the brushes P and Q
are connected to the battery S.

² When a current is made to flow through the motor, the current enters the split
ring X through the brush P and flows through the wire loop ABCD, reaches the
split ring Y and passes to the external circuit through the brush Q.
² The current passes through the loop placed in the magnetic field along the
directions AB and CD.
² Find the direction of the force acting on AB and CD by applying Fleming’s left
hand rule. You will find that the force on AB acts downwards while that on CD
acts upwards. The armature will rotate clockwise due to the resulting couple.
² Let us now consider what happens when the coil and the two split rings have
rotated by 180o and their positions are inverted. This position is shown in Figure
13.22.
² At this point, brush P is in contact with split ring Y while brush Q is in contact
with split ring X. Then the current enters from brush P to split ring Y, flows in
the direction DCBA and reaches split ring X and leaves from brush Q.

is upwards while that of CD is downwards. The resulting couple rotates the
armature further in the clockwise direction.

If the direction of the current is changed by changing the battery terminals, the

13.3 Electromagnetic Induction
We studied the motion caused by electricity in the previous section. We will next
focus on producing an electric current by a conductor that is moving in a magnetic
field.
When there is a current flow through a conductor placed in a magnetic field, a force is
exerted on the conductor causing it to move. Electromagnetic induction is the inverse
of this. That is, if a conductor placed in a magnetic field is set in motion, then an
electromotive force is created between the terminals of the conductor.

Electromagnetism and Electromagnetic Induction
The generation of an electromotive force between the terminals of a conductor when the
conductor is kept at rest in a changing magnetic field or when the conductor is moving
in a constant magnetic field is known as electromagnetic induction.
Electromagnetic induction was first introduced to the world
by Michael Faraday. An important law known as Faraday’s
law regarding this was presented by him in 1831.
The phenomenon of electromagnetic induction is used in
magnetic cards used to enter shops and offices by employees,
and the magnetic cards (credit and debit cards) used to make
payments. Electricity, essential for the daily activities of the
modern world, is mainly generated by converting the energy
produced from sources such as oil, coal and nuclear power
into electric energy through electromagnetic induction.

It can be seen from the above activity that there is a deflection in the galvanometer
for every motion where there is a change in the relative distance between the coil
and the magnet.
² The galvanometer produces a deflection when there is a current passing
through it. In order to create a current, there must be a source of electromotive
force in the circuit. However there is no such source in the circuit above.
² In this case, an electromotive force has been created by the relative motion
between the coil and the magnet. Such an electromotive force is known as an
induced electromotive force.
² When the magnet and the coil get closer to each other or further away from
each other, the magnetic field lines linked to the coil either increase or decrease.
Since a deflection is observed in the galvanometer only at such instances, one
can conclude that there must be a variation in the magnetic field lines linked to
the coil in order to induce an electromotive force.

² A larger deflection is observed in the galvanometer when the magnet is moved
rapidly than when it is moved slowly because the electromotive force induced
in the coil is directly proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic field
lines.
There are several factors affecting the magnitude of the induced electromotive
force. Faraday’s experiments showed these factors as,
(i) the number of turns (windings) in the coil,
(ii) strength of the magnet, and
(iii) speed of motion of the magnet or coil.
13.3.1 Direction of the current induced in a straight conductor
placed in a magnetic field and connected to a closed circuit
When a straight conductor is placed in a magnetic field perpendicular to the field
and moved in a direction perpendicular to both the magnetic field and the conductor,
an electromotive force is induced across the ends of the conductor. If the conductor
is connected to a closed circuit, a current flows through the conductor due to the
induced electromotive force. The direction of current flow can be found using
Fleming’s right hand rule.
● Fleming’s right hand rule
When the first three fingers of the right hand are oriented perpendicular to one
another and the thumb is pointed in the direction of motion of the conductor
and the index finger along the direction of the magnetic field that intersects the
conductor, the middle finger shows the direction of the current flowing through
the conductor.

● Alternating current dynamo
Figure 13.28 shows an alternating current dynamo. A rectangular coil ABCD
consisting of a number of turns of an insulated copper wire wound around it is
connected to an axle that can be rotated around its axis. A strong magnetic field is
applied across the coil using a north and a south pole placed on either side of the
coil as shown in the figure. Terminal A of the coil ABCD is fixed to a coaxial copper
ring P and the other terminal D is fixed to another identical copper ring Q. P and
Q are known as brushing rings.

Two brushes X and Y made of carbon are mounted in such a way that they brush
against the brushing rings. The coil is connected to the external circuit which consists
of a center zero galvanometer through the brushes X and Y. The part consisting of
the coil ABCD, brushing rings and the axle is known as the armature.
Since the arms AB and CD of the coil intersect the magnetic field across the coil
when the coil is rotating, an electromotive force is induced across these arms. Since
the circuit is closed, a current passes through the arms AB and CD of the circuit and
the direction of this induced current can be found using Fleming’s right hand rule.
If the coil is rotated in an anticlockwise direction as shown in the figure, according
to Fleming’s right hand rule the induced current flows from A to B since the arm
AB is moving up and from C to D since the arm CD is moving down. Since both
currents through the arms AB and CD are induced in the same cyclic direction,
a current flows through the coil in the direction ABCD. The current flow across
the galvanometer in the external circuit is from Y to X. Then the galvanometer
indicator deflects to the left.

² Since the arms AB and CD are moving parallel to the magnetic field when the
rotating coil is in position (a), the conductors do not intersect the magnetic field
lines. Therefore an electromotive force is not induced in the arms AB and CD.
Therefore the galvanometer does not show a deflection.
² While the coil is rotating from position (a) to position (b), the rate at which the
field lines are intersected by the coil increases. Therefore, the galvanometer
deflection increases accordingly.
² Position (b) is the position of the coil after the coil has rotated by 90o from
position (a). At this position, the field lines are intersected perpendicularly by
the coil in the upward motion of AB and downward motion of CD. Then a
current flows in the direction ABCD as described above causing a deflection to
the left of the galvanometer.
² While the coil is moving from position (b) to position (c), the coil is rotating
from 90o to 180o and the electromotive force during this period keeps decreasing
and becomes zero at position (c). When the coil rotates from position (c) to (d),
the coil is rotating from 180o to 270o. During this time AB moves down and
CD moves up intersecting the field lines. Using Fleming’s right hand rule one
can find that the induced currents flow from D to C and B to A. Therefore, the
induced current flows through the coil in the direction DCBA. This causes a
deflection to the right hand side of the galvanometer in the external circuit.

Since the induced electromotive force becomes maximum in the horizontal positions
of the coil when the field lines are intersected perpendicularly (in positions (b) and
(d) when plane ABCD of the coil is parallel to the magnetic field), the current flow
becomes maximum at those positions. The induced electromotive force becomes
zero for vertical positions of the coil (positions (a), (c) and (e)).
When the coil rotates continuously in this manner, it can be seen that the current
flow in the external circuit alternates its direction. We can see that the direction
of current flow oscillates periodically since the galvanometer deflects to the left
in (b), becomes zero in (a), (c) and (e) and deflects to the right in (d) repetitively.
That is, the current changes its direction in each half cycle during one complete
cycle of rotation of the coil. The variation of this alternating current or the induced
electromotive force with time can be represented by a sinusoidal wave as shown in
Figure 13.28.
When the plane of the coil is parallel to magnetic field, the EMF becomes a
maximum in + or - direction. when the plane of the coil is perpendicular to the
magnetic field, EMF becomes zero.
● Moving coil magnetic microphone
Figure 13.30 shows a diagram of a moving coil magnetic microphone. When a
sound reaches the diaphragm of the microphone, the diaphragm vibrates in and
out. Then the light coil attached to it also vibrates accordingly. Since the coil
vibrates in a magnetic field, the magnetic flux linked to the coil changes inducing an
electromotive force in the coil. Since the coil moves in both directions, the direction
of the electromotive force alternates. This generates a small alternating current
(flowing in both directions) in the microphone that varies corresponding to the
variations of the sound reaching the diaphragm.

Then the cylindrical magnet connected to the rough head also rotates. Since the
magnetic field linked to the coil wound around the soft iron changes now, an
electromotive force is induced in the coil.

Figure 13.31 – A bicycle dynamo
As a result of winding the dynamo coil around a soft iron it is possible to link most of
the magnetic field lines through the coil which increases the induced electromotive
force.
Since the direction of the magnetic field alternates when the magnet rotates, the
direction of the induced current also alternates its direction. Therefore the output
from a bicycle dynamo is an alternating current.
When the bicycle is ridden fast, the speed of the wheels increases. Then the head
of the dynamo which is in contact with the tire also rotates fast increasing the
rotation speed of the magnet. The increased rate of change of the magnetic field
linked to the coil increases the induced electromotive force which gives rise to a
larger current. Therefore, the brightness of the bicycle lamp increase with the speed
of the bicycle.
An energy transformation takes place in a dynamo. In order to generate electricity,
the dynamo has to be rotated. Therefore in a dynamo, the energy is converted from
mechanical energy to electric energy.
13.3.3 Direct Currents and Alternating Currents
Figure 13.32(a) shows a circuit connecting a battery, a resistor and a center-zero
galvanometer in series. (The resistor prevents a large current from passing through
the galvanometer). The constant deflection of the galvanometer will show that the
current in the circuit is constant. When the current is plotted against time, a straight
line can be obtained as shown in figure 13.32(b).

oscillate in the positive and negative directions around the zero. Therefore when

² When the current in the first circuit is flowing continuously, the current in the
second circuit ceases to flow.
² At the instant that the current flow through the first circuit is turned off, a current
is induced in the second circuit in a direction opposite to the direction of current
flow before.
² When the current flow in the first circuit ceases, the induced current in the second
circuit becomes zero.
In this activity there is no magnetic field through the coils before a current passes
through the first coil. A magnetic field is generated when a current begins to flow
through the first coil. This magnetic field also passes across the second coil through
the soft iron wires. As a result of this change in the magnetic field through the
second coil, an electromotive force is induced in it which causes a current to flow
through the galvanometer giving rise to a deflection in the galvanometer.
When a current is continuously flowing through the first circuit, the magnetic field
remains constant and there is no variation in the magnetic field through the second
coil. Therefore an electromotive force is not induced in it. Then the galvanometer
deflection is zero.
When the switch in the first circuit is opened, the current flow is terminated. The
magnetic field caused by the current too diminishes together with the current. As
a result of the diminished magnetic field, the magnetic field through the second
coil changes and therefore an electromotive force is induced in the second coil.
This induced electromotive force has a direction opposite to that of the previous
occasion. Therefore the galvanometer deflection occurs in the opposite direction.
When there is no current flow through the first coil, an electromotive force is not
induced in the second coil as there is no variation in the magnetic field. Therefore the
galvanometer deflection is zero. Therefore we can conclude that an electromotive
force is induced in the second coil whenever there is a “change” caused by the first
coil in the magnetic field through the second coil.
If we connect an alternating voltage to the first coil, instead of a battery, then as
the magnetic field varies continuously, a similar alternating voltage difference is
induced in the second coil too. Such a combination of coils linked by a magnetic
field is known as a transformer. Transformers only work with ac currents and ac
voltages. They will not work with dc currents and dc voltages. Transformers work
with alternating currents or voltages and with changing direct currents only. They
do not work with cons that direct currents.

Normally one coil of a transformer is connected to an alternating power supply while
the other is connected to a load (a resistor or an electric appliance operated with
an alternating power supply). The first coil that supplies power to the transformer
is known as the primary coil or the “input”. The second coil from which power is
taken out of the transformer is known as the secondary coil or the “output”. The
voltage supplied to the primary is denoted by VP and the voltage given out by the
secondary is denoted by VS.
The alternating voltage VP applied to the primary gives rise to an alternating current
flow in the primary circuit which in turn gives rise to an alternating magnetic field.
This alternating magnetic field is linked to the secondary coil by the soft iron core and
this varying magnetic field induces an alternating voltage VS in the secondary coil.
The relation between the voltages and the number of turns of a transformer can be
expressed as follows.

² Energy Relation in a Transformer
The efficiency of any instrument is not 100% as they produce other forms of energy
(such as heat) apart from what they are intended for. In transformers too, all the
energy supplied to the primary cannot be obtained from the secondary. However
we will assume here that there is no energy loss in the transformer. Then according
the law of energy conservation, efficiency will be 100%. Then the power of the
primary coil is equal to the power of the secondary coil.
Power = Potential difference × Current
Therefore following relationship is obtained.

Summary
² The direction of the magnetic field existing in the vicinity of a current
carrying conductor can be found using the corkscrew rule.
² When a corkscrew is rotated in such way that it moves in the direction
of current flow, then the direction of rotation gives the direction of the
magnetic field lines.
² A force acts on a current carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field.
² This force is directly proportional to three factors; current flowing through
the conductor, length of the conductor and the strength of the magnetic field.
² Fleming’s left hand rule can be used to find the direction of the force acting
on the conductor.
² According to Fleming’s left hand rule, when the thumb, index finger and
the middle finger of the left hand are oriented perpendicular to one another
so that the middle finger points in the direction of current flow and the
index finger is pointed in the direction of the magnetic field, the thumb is
pointed in the direction of the force acting on the conductor.
² The operation of instruments such as the DC motor and the loud speaker
are based on the force acting on a current carrying conductor placed in a
magnetic field.
² In the operation of a motor, electric energy is converted into mechanical
energy.
² The generation of an electromotive force in a closed circuit due to a variable
magnetic field is known as electromagnetic induction.
² The magnitude of the induced electromotive force depends on the number
of turns in the coil, the strength of the magnetic field and the speed of the
moving magnet.
² In order to find the direction of current flow due to the induced electromotive
force in a straight conductor, Fleming’s right hand rule can be used.
² According to Fleming’s right hand rule, when the thumb, index finger and
the middle finger of the right hand are oriented perpendicular to one another
so that the index finger is pointed in the direction of the magnetic field, the
thumb is pointed in the direction of motion, then the middle finger points
in the direction of current flow through the conductor.

When considering the composition of all of the above materials, presence of carbon
as a component element seems to be a common feature. Carbon is also abundant
in the plants and animals that we find in our environment and all the materials
obtained from those sources.
Elements combine with one another in different ways to create a very large number
of compounds. Quite a majority of them are compounds formed by the combination
of carbon with other elements.
Because of the abundance of carbon containing compounds and the special chemical
characteristics shown by those compounds, carbon chemistry (organic chemistry)
is studied as a separate section under chemistry.
The compounds contaning carbon are commonly referred to as organic compounds

and carbonates and bicarbonates such as sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and sodium
bicarbonate (NaHCO3) are not considered organic]. Organic compounds necessarily
contain carbon and in addition, they may contain elements like hydrogen, oxygen,
nitrogen, halogen, phosphorus and sulphur.
For the convenience of study, organic compounds are classified in various ways.
One method is classifying on the basis of the component elements in the organic
compound. On this basis, the simplest group of organic compounds are hydrocarbons
which contain carbon and hydrogen only.

Set the apparatus as shown in figure 14.2, light the candle, connect the apparatus
to the aspirator and make air pass through.
It will be seen that, the anhydrous copper sulphate contained in the U tube turns
from white to blue. This change in colour was brought about by the water produced
during the burning of the candle. Hydrogen required to produce that water was
supplied by candle wax. This verifies the presence of hydrogen in wax.
Also, it can be observed that the limewater contained in the test tube on the right
hand side turns milky. Therefore, carbon dioxide gas has been produced during
the burning of the candle. The source of carbon in that carbon dioxide is wax.
This confirms the presence of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) in candle wax.
All the countries in the world meets their energy requirements by using petroleum
fuels produced by the distillation of crude oil. All compounds in those fuels are
hydrocarbons. Based on the structure, hydrocarbons are classified as alkanes,

Consider the methane and ethane molecules described above. Bonds between
carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms (only) are present in the methane molecule. But
in the ethane molecule there are bonds between carbon and carbon atoms. The
hydrocarbons which have only single bonds between carbon atoms are referred to
as alkanes.
Alkanes are a series of compounds. This series has several common characteristics.
One of those is that all the compounds in that series can be represented by a common
formula.
The common formula of the alkane set is CnH2n+2. In this, 'n' is the number of carbon
atoms in a molecule of the compound. According to the above formula, the formula
of the simplest alkane methane can be obtained as follows.
For methane n
= 1. Hence the formula of methane is,
In ethane
n = 2. Hence the formula of ethane is
C1H1 x 2 + 2 = CH4
C2H2 x 2 + 2 = C2H6
Assignment 14.2
Using the common formula, derive the formulae of alkanes that contain carbon
atoms from 1 to 5.
Listed in Table 14.2 are the formulae and names of the alkanes of which the number
of carbon atoms varies from 1 to 5.
The fuel petrol (gasoline) is a mixture of alkanes. The most abundant alkane in it
is octane represented by the formula C8 H18. L.P. gas, another mixture of alkanes/

there are hydrocarbons having double bonds between carbon - carbon atoms. The
hydrocarbons of this type with one or more double bonds between carbon - carbon

Let us inquire into the chemical nature of the materials shown in the above pictures
that we use frequently in our daily life.
At molecular level, they all have a common special feature. That is, they all are made
up of large molecules arranged in the form of long chains. Another speciality is that
most of those long chain molecules are composed of repeating small molecular
units. Thus, the molecules from which they are made are called polymers. In this
lesson, let us discuss about polymers.
Large molecules formed by the joining of a large number of small molecules
with one another are known as polymers.
The process of forming polymers is called polymerization. The small molecules
forming polymers are known as monomers and the large molecules formed by the
polymerization of monomers are referred to as polymers. Pay your attention to the
chain formed by joining some paper clips together.

The single paper clips used to form the above chain are analogous to monomers and
the chain of clips is equivalent to the polymer. The basic structural units contained
in the chain after the formation of the polymer are referred to as repeating units.
The molecular mass of monomers is relatively low. However, the relative molecular
mass of polymers formed by the polymerization of a large numbers of monomers
has a very high value.
Now, let us investigate into some common polymers.

polymers. Have you heard about natural polymers Pay attention to the
bio - molecules you learnt in grade 10. Molecules like proteins, starch, cellulose and
DNA are polymers. They belong to the category of natural polymers. Therefore, by
origin, polymers can be classified into two types as natural and artificial. Rubber
which is frequently used for technical purposes is also a natural polymer. Table 14.7

polymers are structurally not linear polymers. By joining polymer molecules
laterally to the principle chain of the linear polymers of the type described above,
branched polymers are produced.
The polymers in which the linear chains are cross-linked are known as cross-linked
polymers. Therefore, the polymers can be classified as follows according to the

Summary
• Organic compounds only made up of carbon and hydrogen are called
hydrocarbons.
• In some hydrocarbon molecules, carbon atoms are bound only by single
covalent bonds. Such hydrocarbons are named alkanes.
• Crude oil is a mixture of alkanes. The common formula of the alkane family
is Cn H2n + 2 .
• In addition to alkanes, there are hydrocarbons in nature with double or triple
bonds between carbon atoms.
• Joining of other atoms or atomic groups in place of hydrogen atoms in
hydrocarbons gives rise to other organic compounds.
• The macromolecules formed by linking together of a large number of simple
molecules are known as polymers.
• The polymers present in natural animal parts or plant parts are called natural
polymers. The artificially synthesized polymers are artificial polymers.
• Artificial polymers are generally referred to as plastics.
• The shape of some polymers can be changed by heat whereas in some the
shape cannot be changed by heat.
• Since artificial polymers do not decay, there are both advantages and
disadvantages in them.
• If the management of plastic wastes is not carried out properly, many
environmental problems may arise

existence of organisms is environment. Soil, water and air come under the physical
component and all the organisms that is plants, animals and micro organisms are
included in the biological component or the biotic component. Other than that
temperature, rainfall, humidity and sunlight come under environmental conditions.
The organisms and the physical environment have a balanced relationship. This
favourable relationship is referred to as the environmental equilibrium. Even a
small change in the environment can affect its existence. Then it has an ability to
restore its conditions. But today this equilibrium is affected due to complicated
human activities.

A single organism belongs to a particular species and lives in the environment is
referred to as an individual.
E.g. - Coconut plant, Elephant
A species is a group of similar organisms who can interbreed naturally to produce
fertile offsprings.
Assignment 15.1
Name different species found in a particular location of your home garden or
school premises.
• Population
A group of organisms belong to the same species in a particular geographical
location during a specific time period is called a population.
E.g. - The number of elephants lived in Yala national park in year 2011 is 5,879
Human population in Sri Lanka in year 2014 is 21,899,445
• Community
A group of different populations, interact with each other in a particular area is
reffered to as community
E.g. - Animal community in Yala national park
Mangrove plant community in Negombo lagoon area
• Ecosystem
All the communities and the non living component with which they interact in a
particular area is called an ecosystem.

• Biosphere
The part of the earth and its atmosphere that is inhabited by living things is called
biosphere. The biosphere is composed of three components.
” Lithosphere - The crust and the upper mantle of the earth.
” Hydrosphere - The region that includes all the oceans and fresh water
bodies. 70% of the earth surface is covered with water.
” Atmosphere - The region that contains air around the earth.
15.1.3 Growth of population and growth curves
The number of organisms of a species, living in a unit area of a selected habitat is
called the population density.
E.g. - Human population density of Sri Lanka in year 2014 is 329.12 km-2
The size of a natural population varies with time. There are four factors that affect
the population density.
Immigration (Number of organisms add to the population from outside)
” Births (Number of new born organisms added to the population)
” Deaths (Number of organisms die in the population)
”
” Emigration (Number of organisms leave the population)

Figure 15.4 - Typical population growth curve
Time
Phase 1 - Slow growth phase (Lag phase)
During this phase population growth increases as reproduction gets underway.
Often starts slowly because intially there is a shortage of reproducing individuals
which may widely dispersed.
Phase 2 - High growth phase (Exponential phase/ Log phase)
This phase represents the maximum growth rate as organisms are well adapted to
the environment and the number of organisms that reproduce is high. Presence of
favourable environmental conditions and abundance of food increases the growth
rate of organisms rapidly. Birth rate exceeds death rate.
Phase 3 - Deceleration phase
Due to the competition for resources, food shortage, spreading of diseases, predation
and parasitism, the growth rate of population decreases.
Phase 4 - Stationary phase/ Stabilizing phase
The number of organisms in a population increases till it has a population adapted
to environmental conditions which the environment can bear. Once it reaches its
carrying capacity the population achieves the dynamic equilibrium. During dynamic
equilibrium birth and death rates balance. Hence the growth of the population
is considered as zero. When it comes to this balanced situation the number of
organisms in the population is called as the carrying capacity.

15.2 Mechanisms involve in maintaining the equilibrium
of ecosystems
15.2.1 Flow of energy and nutrients
The energy source of all ecosystems in the biosphere is the sun. Flow of energy and
nutrients among ecosystms is essential for the existence of the biosphere.
² Food web
The mutual relationships for food among organisms is referred to as food webs.
Different trophic levels of many food chains are inter-connected in a web like
structure in the biosphere. Due to this relationship an organism is free to depend
on different types of food. This helps to avoid bioaccumulation of organisms. An
example for a food web is given in figure 15.7

primary consumer and then to the secondary consumer is referred to as a food
chain. This can be shown in a linear diagram as follows.

Assignment 15.4
Observe different modes of nutrition consumed by different organisms in the
environment. Write down their relationships for food.
Trophic level
Every organism belongs to a certain trophic level according to their mode of
nutrition. The links of a food chain are known as trophic levels. The number of
trophic levels of a food chain cannot be exactly predicted. Most often it is less than
five links. Somehow the organisms belong to last trophic level would be carnivorous
predators.
All organisms can be divided into three groups on the basis of their mode of nutrition.
” Autotrophs
” Heterotrophs
” Decomposers
Autotrophs
Organisms such as green plants, algae and some bacteria which can transform simple
inorganic compounds into organic compounds to fulfill their nutrition requirement
are called autotrophs.
According to the energy source used to produce their food, autotrophs can be
divided into two groups, as photo-autotrophs and chemo-autrotrophs. Green plants
are photo-autotrophs and some bacteria are chemo-autotrophs.
172
173
For free distribution
Biosphere
Heterotrophs
The animals that cannot produce their own food are known as heterotrophs.
They depend on food produced by other organisms. Therefore they are known as
consumers. The consumers are further divided as follows,
1' Primary consumers
2' Secondary consumers
(- They are herbivores. Feed on producers.
(- They are carnivores. They can be omnivores too.
Feed on primary consumers.
3' Tertiary consumers
( They are carnivores.
Decomposers
Organisms feed on bodies of dead organisms and organic waste products by
converting complex organic compounds into simple compounds are known as
decomposers. Saphrophytes like bacteria and fungi belong to this group. This
process is called decomposition.
Figure 15.9 - Stages of decomposition process of a dead body
² Ecological pyramids
Ecological pyramids can be built up using number of organisms, biomass and
energy relationships in different trophic levels of an ecosystem.
The base of the pyramid represents, producers, and the rest of the rows represent
consumers in different trophic levels respectively.
There are three types of Ecological pyramids.
” Number pyramid
” Biomass pyramid
” Energy pyramid
Number pyramid
The graphical representation of number of organisms in different trophic levels is
called the number pyramid. It is expressed as the number of organisms per square
meter (1 m2).
The number of organisms in a particular trophic level can be greater or lesser than
the number of organisms in the upper trophic level. Therefore upright and inverted
number pyramids can be seen.
An upright number pyramid is shown in Figure 15.10.

The graphical representation that shows the total amount of organic matter present
in different trophic levels is called biomass pyramid. By considering the dry mass
of organisms it is expressed as grammes per square meter per year (g m-2 yr-1)
Mostly the biomass of consumers is less than the producers. Therefore most of the
time the biomass pyramids are upright. But rarely, the biomass of consumers in
aquatic environment is greater than that of producers. Then the biomass pyramid is
an inverted one.

Energy pyramid
The graphical representation that shows the amount of energy, flows through
different trophic levels is called the energy pyramid. It is expressed as kilo joules
per square meters per year (kJ m-2 yr-1).
Only 10% of energy in a trophic level passes to the upper trophic level. 90% of the
energy is dissipated to the environment. Therefore the energy in the upper trophic
levels is less than the lower trophic levels. So the energy pyramids are always
upright. The number of links in a food chain is less than five levels due to this loss
of energy.

• Flow of energy through ecosystem
The main energy source of the biosphere is the sun. Green plants absorb sunlight,
and water as raw materials to produce glucose. This process of fixing
and use CO2
energy of sunlight is called photosynthesis.
The energy fixed by producers passes from organism to organism along trophic
levels. Only 10% of the energy of lower trophic levels passes to the upper trophic
levels. 90% of energy is lost in each trophic level as heat.
Energy dissipation
The loss of energy during transferring energy from one trophic level to the next, is
called energy dissipation.
For free distribution

Energy expended
for respiration is 60%

15.2.2 Biogeochemical cycle
The process of cyclic circulation of essential chemical components through
atmosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere of biosphere is called Biogeochemical
cycle.
Cyclic circulation of water, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and phosphorous takes
place in the biosphere. The natural environmental balance is maintained by these
Biogeochemical cycles.
A few such Biogeochemical cycles are given below.
” Carbon Cycle
” Nitrogen Cycle
” Phosphorous Cycle
Among the above Biogeochemical cycles carbon and nitrogen cycles are discussed
in details.
• Carbon cycle
The main method of fixing carbon in an ecosystem is photosynthesis. Animals
depend on green plants and they receive carbon through those food. Decomposers
obtain carbon by digesting dead organisms. All organisms release carbon as CO2
during respiration. When decomposers are absent, carbon in dead plants and animals
convert in to fossil fuels. This process needs millions of years to be completed.
During combustion of fossil fuels carbon releases. Micro organisms play a major
role in carbon cycle. They release carbon in dead matter rapidly to the atmosphere.
Carbon cycle is represented in the diagram 15.17.

Industrial fixation
Atmospheric nitrogen converts to nitrate during industrial production of chemical
fertilizers.
Nitrifying bacteria like Nitrosomonas first convert Ammonium compounds into
nitrites and then Nitrobacter bacteria convert nitrite to nitrates. These nitrates are
absorbed by plants and used to synthesise proteins. These plant proteins pass into
animals through food chains.
Due to microbial activity on dead bodies of organisms, the nitrogenous compounds
convert to ammonium compounds known as ammonification and collect into soil.
The denitrifying bacteria like Pseudomonas and Thiobacillus convert nitrates back
to atmospheric nitrogen.

15.3 Different environmental pollutants and their effects
Disposal of different effluents by the rapid growing population, affects the
environmental balance. Let us discuss about the effects of these waste materials.
15.3.1 Environmental pollution
Discharge of pollutants, which cause deleterious effects on natural environment is
called environmental pollution.
Environmental pollution are of three types.
² Soil pollution
² Water pollution

” Greenhouse gases
” Heavy metals
” Particulate matter
” Domestic waste
” Electronic waste

• Excessive usage of agro chemicals
The artificially synthesised chemicals for agricultural practices are called agro
chemicals. Mainly agrochemicals include chemical fertilizers, weedicides,
insecticides, and fungicides. They are used to get short term benefits, but they cause
many ill effects on the environment and hazardous to health.
Weedicides, insecticides and fungicides are commonly known as pesticides. The
dose of a pesticide required to kill 50% of a population of a particular pest species
is defined as lethal dose (LD50).
Assignment 15.6
List out the agro chemicals that are used for a specific crop from its planting to
harvesting. Avoid touching those agro chemicals.

• Discharge of industrial effluents to the environment
The waste materials that discharge after the production process which cannot be
used again are called industrial wastes. The discharge of these industrial wastes to
the environment causes harmful impacts on the environment. Industrial waste are
as follows.
Hydrocarbons
The compounds formed by combination of carbon and hydrogen only in different
ratio are called hydrocarbons.
Methods of releasing hydrocarbons to the environment
² Release of CH4 (methane the simplest hydrocarbon) due to bacterial activity on
garbage and dead plant and animal matter in marshy lands.
² During usage of liquid petroleum (LP gas), petrol, diesel, kerosene as fuel that
are obtained by fractional distillation of crude oil.
² During usage of lubrication oil and greese which are products of fractional
distillation of crude oil.
Emission of greenhouse gases
The temperature of the earth is fixed by a steady state balance between the energy
received from the sun and the energy radiated back by the earth. Carbondioxide,
water vapour, methane, ozone and CFC absorb radiation given out from the earth
and some of it re-radiates back to the earth's surface. This re-radiation helps to warm
the earth and maintains a climate that will support life. This is called greenhouse
effect and these gases are called greenhouse gases.
Types of greenhouse gases
Carbondioxide
Sulphurdioxide
Oxides of Nitrogen

Chloro Fluoro Carbon
Water vapour
(CO2 )

Figure 15.20 - Greenhouse effect
Due to emission of greenhouse gases enormously, global warming increases.
Ways by which greenhouse gases released to the environment
² Release of CO2 due to excessive combustion of fossil fuels.
² Sulphur dioxide is released instead of CO2 due to combustion of fossil fuels and
eruption of volcanos.
² Release of CH4 due to anaerobic decomposition of dead plant and animal matter
in marshy lands and garbage.
² CFC is released when using refrigerators and air conditioned appliances.

” During bacterial activity on organic matter
” During eruption of volcanoes
Oxides of nitrogen (NOx)
Oxides of nitrogen (NO, NO2) cause a big impact on the environment once they are
released to the atmosphere.
Methods of releasing oxides of nitrogen to the environment
• During lightning, the reaction between N2 and O2 form oxides of nitrogen.
• During combustion inside the engines of vehicle N2 and O2 react together to
form oxides of nitrogen.
Acid rain
Naturally rain is little bit acidic due to dissolution of carbondioxide and
nitrogendioxide (NO2). The pH is about 5.6 of natural rain water. Sometimes this
pH decreases, that is acidity of rain increases. The reason for the increase of acidity
in rain is due to increase of sulphurdioxide, sulphurtrioxide and nitrogendioxide in
the atmosphere.
Sulphurdioxide is water soluble and then it makes sulphurous acid (H2SO3) with
water. This sulphurous acid further oxidizes to make sulphuric acid (H2SO4).
Sulphuric acid is formed due to dissolution of sulphurtrioxide too. Nitrogendioxide
helps in increasing acidic nature of rain. It forms nitric acid with water. Water
mixing with above acids to form rain is known as acid rain.

Nuclear-waste
The radio active and high toxic materials discarded by nuclear preparation centres
and nuclear weapons are known as nuclear wastes. Uranium and plutonium are
the main elements used as nuclear fuels. The radioactivity of them can exist for
a longer period of time. Therefore, they are deposited in deep sea or ground after
covering by thick concrete or metal casing.

Food additives
With the industrial development, the usage
of chemicals for domestic purposes instead
of natural materials has become popular. In
present days there are many such chemicals
that are used for domestic purposes. Food
additives, cleaning agents, medicine, paints
and cosmetics are the main chemicals that
come under domestic chemical waste.
The substances that are added to food to enhance the taste, odour, appearence
nutrification and shelf - life are called food additives.

Cleaning agents
Soap or different types of shampoo are used to cleanse skin and hair. Soap or
detergents are used to wash clothes and different types of cleaning agents are used
to clean floors and walls. Cleaning agents are important to do the cleaning activities
which cannot be done with water, better. The basic raw materials of soap are plant
oil or animal fat and a strong base like sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide.
Coconut oil and other plant oils are often used for this purpose.
Soap bubbles are formed less in dense water.
Artificial detergents are used as a solution to this.
These are produced with a mixture of artificially
synthesized chemicals. When both these types
are added to water, it is harmful to the aquatic
organisms. Furthermore, there is a threat of coral
reefs being destroyed in the marine areas near
hotels and it also affects to reduce the bio diversity
of fresh water sources.

Medicines
In the past, man had a sound knowledge of popular indigenous medicines and they
used natural medicines. At present there are different kinds of medicines at home
that are used without prescription to ease simple ailments. Examples are using
anodynes for fever, using different creams for pains and itching and using antacids
for gastro acidity. Moreover, when there are cuts and bruises, antiseptics like spirit
is used. Antiseptics is a chemical which is applied on living tissues which destroy
microorganisms or prevent their growth. When they are used, the correct dosage
should be taken on the correct time. It is very dangerous to use medicine without
the advice of the doctors for a long period of time. In the past, margosa, turmeric
liquid and salt water were used as disinfectants and at present artificial disinfectants
are used to clean the floor, kitchen, toilets and bathrooms. Disinfectants destroy
microorganisms and it is not safe for them to come into contact with living tissues.
Many side effects can be resulted due to their excessive use and they should be
used moderately. By using disinfectants often and excessively in the toilet, the
microorganisms that decompose faeces are destroyed.
The following grid contains examples for medicines, disinfectants and antiseptics
that are used in homes.

years in the history.
At present, perfumes, bleaching creams, talc, hair colourants and bleaches,
deodorants and lipsticks are used as cosmetics. There are naturally or artificially
synthesized oils, colourings, fragrant substances, distilled substances and
preservatives contained in them. Most of them are complex carbonic substances. In
perfumes and deodorants, there are alcohol, esters and distilled substances. When
these are used excessively, some diseases are caused in some people. Sometimes,
headaches, vomiting and breathing difficulties can occur. In most of the lipsticks,
there is led and the excessive usage can cause dryness and cracks on lips.

Mercury is present in some cream. In some other creams, carbon compound that
controls the formation of melanin colourant is present. This will destroy the natural
protection that protects the skin from ultraviolet rays and poses the risk of skin
cancer. It gets into the skin and harms the connective tissues. The use of cream
for a long period of time can cause defects in skin. Sometimes, this can harm the
brain, liver and kidneys. Some hair colourings and compounds with bleaches cause
allergies in some people. This causes itching in the scalp, skin rashes, swelling,
cancers and even death.
Paints
A material that is applied on sufaces to protect the surface having a desired colour
are called paints. Paints contain three components.
² Pigment - They are produced mainly by metal oxides or metal salts.
Bronze, gold, zinc and alminium metals are prepared into a fine powder and
used as pigments.
² Binder or non volatile substance
² Vehicle or solvent - Volatile hydrocarbonic substance such as turpentine is
used as vehicle. water is used as the vehicle for water soluble binders.
• Cumbustion of fossil fuel and waste matter
Combustion of fossil fuel enormously in factories, automobiles, petroleum power
stations results in emitting a large amount of carbonmonoxide (CO), carbondioxide
(CO2) and sulphurdioxide (SO2). Burning of plastics and polythene too emits dioxin
and other gases.
• Persistent Organic Pollutants - POPs
Some toxic, hazardous organic substances have been identified as persistent organic
pollutants. They are released to the environment from different sources. These
pollutants have certain specific features as follows.
² Persist in the environment for a long of time period
² Accumulate in the body of organisms along food chains
² Widely dispersed in the environment
² Highly toxic

Acid rain
It is mentioned in page 184 about acid rain. Acid rain has been described as a
harmful condition caused by the industrial wastes such as oxides of nitrogen and
sulphur.
Global warming
Greenhouse effect occurs in the atmosphere with the high concentration of the
polyatomic molecules of greenhouse gases such as carbondioxide, methane, CFC
etc. High amount of energy received from sun is refracted away from the earth
when the greenhouse gases exceed their permissible level. Hence, the temperature
of the atmosphere increases. This is called global warming. Changes that occur due
to global warming are shown in Figure 15.28

Depletion of ozane layer
Ozone is a trimetric molecule of oxygen. This is a thin layer found at 25 km away
from the earth surface. At higher atmosphere oxygen absorbs Ultra Violet radiation
and forms atomic oxygen.This atomic oxygen is highly reactive. They react with O2
to form O3. This O3 is converted back to O2 and natural equilibrium is maintained.
This ozone layer acts as a protective shield to prevent the entry of harmful UV
radiation to the earth surface. But gases like CFC and nitric oxide (NO) destroy
ozone layer by detaching O2. CFC at higher atmosphere obtain solar radiation and
is converted to atomic chlorine. This atomic chlorin reacts with O3 and breaksdown
ozone molecules. Similarly nitric oxide also reacts with ozone to destroy them.
Due to the depletion of ozone layer, holes appear in it. As a result, radiation with
high energy reaches the earth surface.

Indirect effects of environmental pollution
•
Loss of habitats of organisms
The natural environment where a plant or an animal lives is known as a habitat.
These habitats are lost due to environmental pollution. Wild elephants tempt to
destroy villages and agricultural lands due to the loss of their habitat. That is a
result of environmental pollution.
Desertification
The change of the ground condition making unsuitable for the plant growth is called
desertification. Deforestation, greenhouse effect, salination and natural causes such
as weather changes are the reasons for desertification. Irregular monsoon rains
causing droughts is a result of this.
Reduction of crop yield
When the conditions required for photosynthesis are not present in optimum levels
the productivity of plants is affected. Therefore, the yield is reduced. Lands become
infirtile due to their constant use for agriculture. The productivity of plants decreases
through water, land and air pollution.
Constructions and degradation of natural environment
Metal statues, buildings, ruins and marble buildings are eroded by acid rains. Natural
limestones also degrade due to acid rains. As temperature of the environment
increases wall plasters and paintings of Taj Mahal is at a risk of deterioration.

Health issues
As environment is polluted, the infectious (contagious) and non - infectious
(non-contagious) diseases spread rapidly in the environment. Due to improper
disposal of garbage, diseases like Dengue spread.
Reduction of biodiversity
Reduction of number of species in a unit area of biosphere is known as reduction
of biodiversity. When pruning some plants used in landscaping some parts are
removed. When ornamental fish like catfish grow in size they are released to the
natural water bodies. These organisms become a threat to other organisms in the
natural environment and affect the biodiversity.
Introduction of invasive species
Invasive species are results of the changes in the environment' These species can
tolerate the conditions and therefore invade the habitats of native species.
E.g. - Giant Mimosa, Trout, Andara, Lantana

Industrialization
Several factors on earth affect the life style of human. Industrialization, urbanization,
commercial agriculture and irrigation systems are some of them.
²
The process by which a country transforms primarily from an agricultural society
to a society that produces goods and services is called industrialization. The
industrialization initiated from Western Europe in AD 1800 with the technological
development and insufficiency of small scale production.
For free distribution

² Urbanization
Aggregation of people in areas with abundant resources with the growth of human
population is called urbanization. People migrate to cities in search for employments
and comfortable life style. As a result, urbanization takes place.
Biosphere
Figure 15.33 - View of an urban area
Irrigation systems
² Commercial agriculture
Large scale agriculture which exceeds the subsistance food production and
commercial intentions are called as commercial agriculture. Here, use of modified
varieties to obtain productive harvest, agrochemicals and machinary are taken into
consideration.
²
Instead of depending on direct rain water, man constructed tanks, ponds, reservoirs,
canals, dams and tunnels to obtain water for agricultural purposes. They are
considered as irrigation systems.
² Utilizing materials and energy abundantly and differently
Due to technological development and complex needs of life, materials harmful
to environment in a great extent are being used while minimum labour is spent
whereas machinery is used consuming energy.
15.4.2 Problems that arise due to changes in life style
² Growth of non contagious diseases and dissabilities
Diseases which are not spread from one person to the other are called as
non contagious diseases. According to data of World Health Organization
(WHO) annually 38 million people die due to these type of diseases. Most
comman contagious diseases are cancers, pulmonary diseases and diabetes
Excessive consumption of tobacco and liquor, wrong food habits and lack of
physical exercises are the causes for these diseases. Non contagious diseases have

become a major problem in Sri Lanka today. Out of the deaths occured due to
diseases, 60% had occured due to non contagious diseases. Out of them several
diseases are given below.
Chronic Kidney Disease /CKD
Chronic Kidney Disease or renal failure is spreading gradually in agricultural areas
in Sri Lanka. Gradual loss of kidney functions including the urine production is
known as renal failure.There are two main forms of renal failure as follows,
1. Acute renal failure
Loss of kidney function temporarily for a few hours or days is a feature of acute
renal failure. It is often reversible with immediate treatment.
2. Chronic renal failure
Chronic renal disease causes gradual loss of kidney function which is not reversible.

Diabetes
Increase of blood glucose level above the normal level is known as diabetes.
Normally, insuline converts the excess glucose in the blood into glycogen and
allows it to store in the liver. Failing of the secretion of insulin due to dysfunction
or inborn absence of beta cells in the Islets of Langerhans which is located in the

pancreas, secretion of insulin fail. When diabetes is not controlled kidney weakens
and gradual blindness occurs. Due to busy life style, consumption of food items
made of wheat floor and polished rice which are digested instantly, abstaining from
exercising and mental stress are some of the causes of diabetes.
Cancer
Cancer is a disease caused by an uncontrolled division of abnormal cells in a part of
the body. With the industrialization, harmful radiation, chemical and heavy metals
are abundant in the environment. Frequent exposure to radiation and intake of
heavy metals to the body, increase the possibility of a cancer.
Heart diseases
Narrowed or blocked blood vessels, heart muscles, valves or rythem not functioning
properly lead to heart diseases. Chest pain, heart attack, strokes, thrombosis are
some forms of heart diseases. The main cause of heart diseases is the changes in
the human life style. With the industrialization, activities of human have become
more convenienced, lack of physical exercises, rest and mental stress cause these
diseases.
Pulmonary diseases
An unhealthy condition which affects the organs or tissues which involves in the
respiration such as trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, alveoli and other nerves and
muscles may cause pulmonary diseases. Harmful gases emitted from vehicles and
factories also contribute to this.
Wheezing
The air ways are obstructed by the mucus produced due to allergies in trachea,
bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli of the respiratory system. Harmful gases and dust
particles ( Air pollutants and irritants) remain as causes.
Gastritis
Inflammation and swelling in the lining of the stomach due to increasing acidity
is the main symptom of this disease. Not taking meals on time because of busy
life style, frequent consumption of food containing excessive oil and acids, mental
stress caused because of living under a competitive condition are the causes of this
disease.

Cataracts
Due to the change in the nature of proteins in the lens of the eye, the transparency
of the lens ceases. It is known as the cataract. Here, light does not enter the eye and
the eye sight is weakened. Due to the emission of harmful gases from factories, the
ozone layer becomes depleted. Thus, ultraviolet rays fall on earth. The exposure to
these rays is a cause for this disease.
15.5 Sustainable development and environmental
management
Sustainable development is the smart use of the natural resources by safeguarding
the balance of the environment in such a manner that the future generations can use
them in the future.
Environmental management is the maintenance of natural resources by using them
in an environmental friendly manner to fulfill the needs of man.
15.5.1 Sustainable agricultural uses
A sustainable development could be expected by reforestation, use of traditional
knowledge and technology, carbon foot print, minimizing food miles, waste
management and energy management.
• Multiple cropping
Cultivation of different crops in one land area instead of mono cropping in large
scale is called multiple cropping. Multiple cropping avoids the risk of destroying
the cultivation with a disease and also reduce pests with high resistance.
Figure 15.35 - Mono cropping
Figure 15.36 - Multiple cropping
• Biological pest control
The biological pest control is the use of another plant, animal or a microorganism
which do not harm the cultivation in order to destroy pests. Coconut catepillar
Promecotheca cumingii was a major coconut pest which was successfully controlled,
using a larval parasitoid Dimokia javanica.

• Use of organic fertilizer
It is environmental friendly to use substances made by transforming complex
organic compounds found in animals and plant parts to simple compounds as
fertilizers. Organic fertilizers are the decomposed plant and animal matter which
help to improve, soil structure and porosity to enhance the activity of soil organisms.
Assignment 15.9
Engage in a discussion about the advantages caused to the environment by using
the above mentioned agricultural uses.
² Reforestation for environmental balance
Environmental management is the maintenance of natural resources by using them
in an environmental friendly manner to fulfill the needs of man.
As a result of changing the environment by man according to his necessity, the
forest cover gradually decreased. Specially, paddy cultivation, vegetable cultivation,
tea cultivation, rubber cultivation and large scale development projects were the
reasons for this situation.
At present, we experience the harmful effects of the decrease of the natural forest
cover. Therefore, in order to reestablish the environmental balance, it is necessary
to do reforestation in suitable areas.
Figure 15.37 - Reforestation
15.5.2 Traditional knowledge and use of technology
² Agriculture
It is mentioned that during the rule of King Parakramabahu the Great, our country
was self sufficient with rice and rice had even been exported. But, at present, we are
unable to achieve such heights although machines and agricultural chemicals are
excessively used. Therefore, instead of seeds and agricultural chemicals purchased
from multinational companies, it is the high time to use traditional agricultural
methods such as local seeds and cultivation methods.

the world. Historical large tank can be identified as a great technical attempt with a
very complex scientific knowledge.

The
constructed
across a river, canal or a branch
of it with the aim of collecting
sufficient water for agricultural
activities is known as a tank.

The large tanks distributed in the dry zone of
Sri Lanka hold a huge water capacity. Major
factor that should be paid attention to
constructing such large scale tanks is,
keeping the collected water for a long time.
Also by controlling the pressure caused by
its colossal capacity of collected water and
controlling the power caused by its extremely
destructive pressure when the water is taken
out for use.
Figure 15.39 - Major parts of a tank
There are several functions done by tank bund, sluice, Bisokotuwa (Sluice gate),
Ralapanawa and canal, which are considered as the major parts of a tank. The tank
bund was built with soil connecting the hills from either side.
The robustness is essential if the stability of the tank bund and needs to be protected.
To maintain this situation a systematic methodology has been applied. Tank bund
had been constructed of several soil layers. It had been made of several thoroughly
beaten layers such as, a layer of clay, soil, gravel and clay (Kirimeti) layer, kept one
on one.

204
205
\
Figure 15.40 - A sluice gate
Biosphere
When water in large tanks is taken out a
huge pressure is exerted and the magnitude
of pressure increases with the height of
water column. The sluice was built at a
specific level on the tank bund using huge
pieces of stones in a way that it began from
the area where water is filled in the tank
bund and going under the tank bund or
piercing it. A slab of stone, connected to the
sluice vertically was used to release water.
There are more than one sluice made in
tanks with a high bund.
Bisokotuwa is also a part of the sluice. It means that the rectangular space made of
stones, from which water flows out from the tank. Its purpose is to take water out
with less pressure level after releasing water at different pressure levels. The mud
sluice is at the bottom level of a tank bund. This mud sluice was used to remove
alluvial collected after a rainy season.
When a tank is filled with water, waves occur on its surface, and the waves can
erode the bund. The Ralapanawa is made by keeping stones on the interior slope of
the tank bund. A brink (Isweti) is built to avoid collecting water with eroded mud,
sand and gravel, to the tank water.
The small sized water tanks built in the upper part of tank collect water first and
next the large tank.
The upper part of tank that is Head wall (Wew Ismaththa) is the water catchment
area. Clearing forest, cultivation and building of houses is strickly prohibited in this
area.
The surrounding area parellel to the water level is known as wew thawulla and this
is rich with natural habitats of flora and fauna.
Accordingly, tank is a marvellous human creation that is compatible with nature.

Indegeneous medical science
²
This field consists of Aurveda, Siddha, Unani and native medicinal fields, which
has history of thousands of years. Ayurveda is one of the important medical fields,
descended from India. It is a perfect science with two traditions.
1. Clinical medicine (Kayachikithsa)
2. Surgical science
According to Ayurveda there are three types of reaction that take place in human
body. Those three factors are known as Va, Pith and Kapha.
'Va'
'Pith'
- Air
- Bile
'Kapha'
- Phlegm
Imbalance of these three factors cause diseases according to Ayurveda. Ayurveda
field of medicine, use plants, or parts of plants to treat patients.
Treatments are given in three ways
1. Medicine 2. Food
3. Exercises
In Ayurvedic medicine, treatments are done to the cause or root to the disease.
Body activity is not controlled artificially by giving medicine (drugs) externally.
Therefore side effects are not resulted.

Food is also a significant factor to cure diseases. It should be consumed to balance
Va, Pith and kapha the three factors.
Its main target is not only curing diseases, but also maintaining physically and
mentally fit healthy life.
15.5.3 Carbon footprint and minimization of food mile
² Carbon footprint
The amount of carbondioxide released into the atmosphere as a result of the activities
of a particular individual, organization or community is a carbon footprint. Total
carbonfoot print cannot be calculated as CO2 is naturally produced whereas it needs
more data.
² Water footprint
The amount of fresh water utilized in the production or supply of the goods and
services used by a particular person or group.
Chocolate 1kg
Beef 1kg
Eggs 1kg
Sugar 1kg
Coffee 1kg

² Food mile
The distance over which a food item is transported during the journey from producer
to consumer, is known as food mile.
The food mile changes according to the quantity of food and the place it is produced.
E.g. - Food mile of some of the foods that you take for your breakfast can be
calculated as follows. Suppose you are in kurunegala.

As long as the food mile is short, sustainability and environmental friendliness is
high. Therefore we should take actions to shorten the magnitude of food mile.
15.5.4 Waste management
Consumption of substances becomes greater with the increase of human population.
Eventhough natural waste materials deteriorate gradually, they get collected to the
environment rapidly. Odour of such waste spreads in urban areas, rather than in
villages. Non deteriorative materials such as polythene, plastic, electrical cells,
electronic waste, electric bulbs and, printed coloured newspapers get collected
in the environment continuously. When burning these waste materials gases such
as dioxine emits. When these waste materials are burried, soil gets polluted and
heavy metals get collected into soil. Public is unaware of the danger of them. It
is very important to be knowledgeable that gradual disposal of the tiny piece of
plastic, battery of a mobile phone CFL bulb be catostrophic. It is our responsibility
to collect waste matter separately and forward it to the process of recycling.
The waste handling technique named 4R is practised in waste management
Reuse - Use as many items as possible again and again.
E.g. Polythene
Reduce - Unnecessary items should be avoided or minimized.
E.g. - Avoid taking antibiotics and vitamins unnecessarily

Biosphere
Replace - Use of eco friendly substances instead of incompatible materials with
nature.
E.g. - Use of organic fertilizer instead of chemical fertilizer.
Recycle - Process to convert different raw materials, animal dung and dead bodies
into new products to prevent waste of potentially useful materials.
E.g. - Production of bio gas using animal excretory matter, dung and
dead matter.
Recyling polythene and plastic in order to produce fuel.
15.5.5 Energy management
Consumer is provided with an opportunity to utilize energy with the aim of
conservation of energy and minimization of cost. Planning and monitoring of
energy production and consumption is required for sustainable utilization and then
fulfil the needs of the consumer. This process is referred to as energy management.
• Energy crisis and technological issues
Drastic increase of price of economically important energy resources due to their
constricted supply is referred to as energy crisis. Fuel oil crisis, electiricity crisis
and dearth of energy resources also indicate this problem. Energy crisis occurs as a
result of the great demand for the supply of limited natural energy resources.
Reasons for energy crisis
² Drastic growth of human population
²
Increase of the number of industries
² Over consumption of energy
² Wasting energy
² Non investigation of renewable energy resources
² War activities
² Political problems
Technical problems arise during the management of available energy. Technology
for extraction of energy resources, methodology of purifying energy resources are
some of them.
Assignment 15.11
List out the steps you follow to utilize energy with minimum wastage.
• Monitoring of daily energy consumption
It is necessary to be aware and compare the energy consumption by measuring it
daily. Then wastage can be minimized.

In this context making the public enthusiastic on reduction of energy consumption
and improving energy efficiency are ensured.
• Energy efficiency
Energy efficiency is defined as utilization of minimum quantity of energy for a
particular service through effective management of energy consumption.
It is possible to improve energy management and control through energy efficiency.
It also enables to provide an enhanced service by utilizing minimum energy.
However this does not mean that the service is withheld or controlled.
Assignment 15.12
Investigate the electrical appliances at your home and record their wattage (power).
Hence compare their level of energy consumption.
• Sustainable energy use
In sustainable use maintenance of a certain aspect at a desired status/level is
expected. Due to technical reasons, utilization of most renewable energy resources
still remains at a lower level.
E.g. Solor energy, Wind energy, Biomass
Importance of utilizing natural energy in architecture
In constucting a house some steps need to be taken in order to maintain good indoor
air circulation. When natural sunlight incidents upon the surfaces the temperature
of indoor environment increases. Hence it is not desirable to place fenestrations
(windows) on East and West walls of the house. Especially since heat transfer from
the western side is high, it is not done. By placing windows on North and South
directions good air circulation and natural cooling can be maintained within the
house. Electrical energy consumption for air conditioning can be minimized to a
great extent by means of natural ventilation. Day light harvesting can be utilized
for reducing electrical energy consumption due to artificial lighting. This enables
a substantial reduction of operational cost of a building. Using thick curtains can
also lead to reduction of heat transfer in air conditioned spaces. This considerably
reduces energy consumption for air conditioning. Rain water harvesting can
be applied as an energy conservation measure. In boiler systems exhaust gases
discharged through the chimney stack contain high temperature waste heat which
can be extracted to heat boiler feed water and as an air pre-heater. With the utilization

of eco-friendly natural energy sources it is possible to minimize the adverse effects
on the environment.
Different Conventions, Legislations and Acts are in function at international and
national level for the management and sustainable use of the environment.
Several examples for international conventions are given below.
” Montreal protocol to control the gases which harm the ozone layer
” Kyoto protocol to minimize the emission of greenhouse gases
State institutions under the Ministry of Environment, Central Environment
Authority, Marine Environment Protection Authority, Geological Survey and
Mines Bureau, State Timber Corporation, National Gem and Jewellery Authority

Summary
There is a natural balance among living organisms, physical component and the
environmental conditions in the biosphere. This balanced relationship is known
as the environmental equilibrium.
The increasing human population and their activities cause the breakdown of
the ecological balance.
The simple organizational level that is individual, organize to form population,
community, ecosystem and finally forms the biosphere.
The flow of energy and natural minerals among organisms is essential to
maintain the ecological balance.
The flow of energy and nutrient among organisms occur through food chains,
food webs and bio geo-chemical cycles.
Environmental pollution is the breakdown of ecological balance due to the
waste materials released to the environment by man.
” Agro chemicals, industrialized waste, greenhouse gases, heavy metals,
particulate matter, food additives, cleaning agents medicine, detergents and
perfumes are the main causative agents of environmental pollution.
” Man is experiencing direct and indirect effects of environmental pollution at
present.
” Usage of indegenous knowledge and technology, indegenous medicines waste
management and energy management are some of the effective ways for
sustainable development.

the use of Grade 11 students in the Sri Lankan school system with effect from 2016.
An effort has made here to arrange the subject content to suit the national educational
goals, common national competencies, the objectives of teaching science and the
content of the syllabus.
The subject of science directs the student towards a more active learning process in
a manner as to develop knowledge, skills and attitudes needed for a developmental
scientific thought.
Each chapter is compiled based on the three main subject areas that comprise the
Science subject; Biology, Chemistry and Physics. Pictures, charts, graphs, activities
and assignments are included to enable the easy understanding of the related
concepts of the subject.
At the end of each chapter, a summary was included and it provides the opportunity
to identify the basic concepts of each chapter and to revise the subject matter.
Furthermore, there is a series of exercises at the end of each chapter. It will contribute
to measure the expected learning outcomes through a self evaluation.
Activities, self evaluative questions, solved examples, assignments and exercises
are planned in a manner as to develop the higher order skills such as it enables
the students to develop knowledge as well as the higher order skills such as
comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation.
For the purpose of directing the student to study further about the subject matter,
more information is included in the “For extra knowledge”. It is given only to
broaden the subject area of the child and certainly not to ask questions at term tests.
Some of the activities mentioned in the textbook could be performed at home and
some of them should be performed in the science laboratory of the school. Activity
