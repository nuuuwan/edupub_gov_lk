4.1 Small scale businesses
Now that you have completed Chapter three and reached Chapter four, we assume
that you have gained a broad understanding about the concept of business. Businesses
can be categorized under different bases. One such basis is the categorization of
businesses according to their size. Here, three categories can be identified
V Small scale businesses
V Medium scale businesses
V Large scale businesses
Out of the three types of businesses given above, what is the type that you see
most commonly in your area? You will observe that it is the small scale businesses.
This shows that small scale businesses play an important role within the business
economy.
Small scale businesses have been defined in various ways. One such definition is
as follows:
Businesses that are conducted in an independent manner, under private ownership,
with a relatively small number of employees and a low sales volume, are small
scale businesses.
Activity 01
The following is an excerpt from an interview given by Mr. Naveen Fernando to
the monthly magazine “The Small Businessman”:
When I started up this business, all that I put in was my own small plot
of land and a small sum of about Rs. 5000. I also took in two or three
employees. Since I own this business myself, it is very easy to run it. My
business activities are mostly limited to the village. Though it is difficult
to compete with large scale businesses, my business does have a strong
foundation…

4.2 Relationship between small scale businesses and
entrepreneurship
Having reached this chapter, we assume that you already have some understanding
about small scale businesses and entrepreneurship. You will find that many
entrepreneurs have started up their career through small scale businesses.
Entrepreneurial skills and hidden strengths (potential) of a person can be put into use
to create opportunities for business development. It is through small scale businesses
that most innovations have been created. It is easy for small scale businessmen to
make use of their creative thinking and experiment with new products.
Today, the large scale businesses operating in the market cannot fulfil the needs and
wants of everybody. As a result, there remains a section of the market whose needs
and wants have not been satisfied (i.e. a market gap). By studying the market gap
carefully, good business opportunities can be generated. Small scale businesses are
ideal to address such opportunities.
There are many Sri Lankans who have conquered the business world through small
scale businesses, by identifying their own skills and potential, and making use of
their creative thinking.
Accordingly, the relationship between small scale businesses and entrepreneurship
can be indicated through the following
V Many successful large scale businesses have been started up in a small scale.
V It is easy for entrepreneurs to make practical use of their creative skills, and
this gives rise to innovations.
V When the market gap is identified, business opportunities can be exploited.

4.3 Importance of small scale businesses for economic
development
The importance of small scale businesses for the country’s economic
development can be discussed along the following factors
V Increase in employment
As small scale businesses come up in rural and peripheral regions, more job
opportunities are generated in those areas. When people take up such jobs,
the rate of employment is increased.
V Increase in the national production
Small scale businesses create various products. Their value is added to the
national production. This leads to an increase in national production.
V Greater equality in the income distribution
As small scale businesses spread throughout the country, more jobs are
created, and the people employed in them can earn their living. This way,
when many people earn an income, the inequalities of income distribution
are reduced.
V Providing goods and services that are not offered by large scale businesses
It is difficult to fulfil the needs and wants of everybody through large scale
businesses. A small scale entrepreneur who is capable of identifying this
market gap can easily supply the required products to the market.
V Possibility of becoming large scale businesses in time
As time passes, small scale business owners can transform their businesses
into large scale ones, through their enthusiasm, dedication and creativity.
V Making use of indigenous knowledge and resources
Small scale businesses most often use indigenous knowledge and resources
for their business activities. This brings additional benefits. For example,
it will stop such knowledge and resources from being wasted. Further,
it will create a market for them, as well as add them an economic value.

4.8 Roles of an entrepreneur
A role refers to the functions performed by each party with regard to some work.
When engaged in a small scale business, an entrepreneur has many tasks to perform.
These functions performed as an entrepreneur can be identified as the roles of an
entrepreneur.
For example, consider the functions performed by the father in a family. He has
many roles - as a protector, a guide, an employee, a teacher, etc. All of these roles are
necessary for the success of the institution called “family”. Similarly, the principal
of your school also has many different roles to perform.
An entrepreneur has different roles as the business owner, a manager, and a
leader. Though we consider these roles separately, they are interrelated; and this
interrelation is crucial for the success of the business.
Role of the business owner
The ownership of a business is obtained by investing resources in the business.
Investing resources can be done in different ways, such as by investing money, by
putting in physical resources such as furniture, land etc, or by contributing through
one’s skills, talents etc.
When an entrepreneur fulfills tasks such as providing the necessary resources,
taking risks, making decisions etc in order to reach the goals and objectives of the
business, it can be identified as the business owner’s role.
Example :-
buying the equipment necessary for the business
taking up the profit or loss that is incurred
Role of the manager
It is important to use resources so as to fulfil the goals and objectives of the business.
This can be simply referred to as ‘management’. To attain success in a business, the
business owner must play the manager’s role very well.
This way, the manager’s role is to use the resources (which have been supplied in
the role of business owner) appropriately in order to attain the goals of the business.
Example :-
formulating business plans
checking their implementation

Role of the leader
When attaining the established goals and objectives of a business, a good leadership
is essential especially with regard to the human resource. Being a living resource,
humans always respond where it is required. So a proper leadership for them is a
must.
When an entrepreneur properly leads, motivates and influences the human resource
of the business as required, it can be identified as the role of the leader.
Example :-
Motivating and guiding the employees
Commanding them in work
Although these have been discussed as separate roles, an entrepreneur will have
to perform all of them in the context of a small scale business. These roles are all
interdependent. Study the following diagram.
