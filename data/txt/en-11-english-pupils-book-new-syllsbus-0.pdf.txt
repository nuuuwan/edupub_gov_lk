1 OUR RESPONSIBILITIES
Activity 1
Act out
Vikum and Chamindu meet each other in the bus on their way to school.
Vikum
- Good morning Chamindu! The bus is crowded today. Give me
your school bag or would you rather sit here?
Chamindu - Good morning! Thank you Vikum. It’s not too far. Just keep
my bag.
Vikum
- Sure. By the way, did you manage to find facts for the debate
next week?
Chamindu - Yes. I've planned to visit the local library too.
Vikum
- We’ve got to propose the idea “Discipline cannot be achieved
only through laws”.
Chamindu - Yes. I’ve read some articles about it. My sister also
downloaded some articles from the internet. It’s quite an
interesting topic, isn’t it?
Vikum
- Of course! My mother says it’s a timely topic that all school
children should be made aware of.
Chamindu - I think so too. Discipline cannot be imposed only through laws.
Vikum
- Hmm… It will be an interesting debate.
Chamindu - There is an article on vandalism too in my sister’s collection of
articles.
Vikum
- What’s that? I’ve never heard that word before. Can you please
repeat the word?
Chamindu - Van-da-lism. Let’s read my sister’s articles and discuss more at
school.
Vikum
- Oh! Here comes a pregnant mother. I’ll offer my seat to her.

Activity 4
Reading / Writing
This is the article Chamindu’s sister found on vandalism. Read it and do the
activities that follow.
VANDALISM /vændəlizəm/
Vandalism is an offence that is caused
when a person deliberately destroys,
alters or defaces someone else's property
without permission. It is mostly aimed at
public property such as public transport
services, bus stops, parks, road signs and other public places. It can also occur at
individual level too such as scratching someone’s car or distorting the information on a
person’s website.
Among many reasons, personal attitudes and basic social problems are at the root of
vandalism. It may occur because of a lack of meaningful activities, disciplinary problems,
and negative feelings such as revenge, boredom, anger, and frustration. It can be the
result of peer group pressure, playfulness, curiosity and pleasure too. Although most
vandals do not have a clear motive for their acts, and may consider it as a simple act
of fun or art. However, it is a punishable crime with imprisonment, monetary fines, or
both as laws exist in a country to prevent vandalism.
Certain effects of vandalism are considered insignificant while others are considered
extremely severe. However, it is a problem that affects everyone in some way or other.
For free distribution
It can affect one’s family, friends, and the
community. When facilities, such as public
transport services, parks and public restrooms
are vandalized, it makes using such places
unpleasant and demoralizing. As a result of
vandalism, fire and emergency services are
affected by increased workloads. Citizens of a
country pay their taxes in order to build a better
community for the future generation. But when
public property is vandalized, they are the ones
who have to pay for the damage.
There are different approaches that can be taken to prevent vandalism. It can be
done by educating individuals, especially the young people about its consequences and
nature. Another way to prevent vandalism is to use property designs such as ceramic
tiles on walls which are easy to clean. In addition, rough textured surfaces where
scrawling with graffiti is impossible,
reduce vandalistic behaviour
public places. An essential approach
to reducing vandalism is to monitor
the condition of a property regularly.
Studies reveal that vandalism carried
out by individuals of all ages increases when people think they are left out from
the society or community. Thus, involvement in community activities can encourage
a sense of belonging and pride which will help them to respect and think positively
about their community. Everyone should understand the duties and responsibilities
of a citizen and decide what is right and what is wrong. Therefore, in preventing
vandalism, self-discipline plays a bigger role than laws.

27th January 2016
Dear Kalani,
How are you? I hope you are doing fine. Thank you very much for your
letter and the birthday card. I was waiting for a letter from you when the
postman delivered it. It’s a lovely card made out of natural flowers and
leaves which we all admired.

As you mentioned in your letter, I’m a year older now. I totally agree
that we have to think seriously and plan our future. We have to take the
responsibility of our own lives.
Kalani, I will tell you how I celebrated my birthday. On my birthday, I
donated some books to the local library. My parents said that it was a
very thoughtful deed. My father had visited the library a week before he
organized this for me. We were given a list of books that they needed. In
fact, the librarian had been waiting for a long time to get those books for
the library. We were happy to donate some of them. I went with my mother
to purchase the books. On my birthday, we went to church in the morning
and then delivered the books to the library. I felt happy as I did something
useful on my birthday this year. You know what? My brother has already
made similar plans for his birthday too.
So Kalani, how are things going on for you? Hope you are having a fantastic
time in Nuwara Eliya. Hope to hear from you soon. Give my regards to your
parents.
Best Wishes,
Farah.

Reading/ Writing
Read the following text and answer the questions that follow.
Water rafting is an adventurous outdoor team activity. It is done in white
water or different degrees of rough water using an inflatable raft. This sport is
challenging and considered to be dangerous, if the necessary safety precautions
are not followed. This has now become a popular sport. However, it is necessary
to minimize the impact of this sport on nature. There should be a “leave no
trace” policy when engaging in rafting. The sportsmen should learn to dispose
of waste properly, leave what they find in the wilderness, respect wild life, keep
fires small etc.
There is another popular action sport called skydiving. This is also known as
parachuting. Skydiving is done by jumping out of an aircraft and falling for as
long as one safely can before opening the parachute. Once the sportsmen jump
out of the aircraft they fall freely with the aid of gravity. The real challenge is
to slow down the fall and reach the earth with the help of the parachute. This
sport is practised even during the 18th century and it is said that in 1797, Andre
Jacques Garnerin jumped from a hot air balloon with a parachute. It was the
first incident of truly modern skydiving. In the military it is used as a back up
safety mechanism for airmen. Many modern militaries use skydiving for troop

deployment. Wildfire fighters also parachute to reach remote sites, so that they
can be on the ground quickly. At present, it is a well-known recreational sport.
Surfing is done with the help of a surfboard. This is an act of riding on a wave,
especially a sea wave. This can be challenging when the waves become rough.
There are three major styles of surfing. This is done in natural waves as well
as in artificial waves. This sport has developed into a number of other types,
including skateboarding, wakeboarding, skimboarding, and windsurfing among
others. Skateboarding is popular among teenagers. This is an action sport which
enables riding and performing tricks on the skateboard.
Pole vaulting is a challenging sport. In this track and field event, the sportsman
uses a long, flexible pole as an aid to jump over a bar. Pole jumping competitions
were known to the ancient Greeks, Cretans and Celts. The sportsman should
have a speed of a sprinter, the flexibility of a gymnast, and the vertical jump of a
jumper. This needs courage to jump up in the free air with a pole. The sportsmen
need not only to jump a considerable height but also to land correctly. This has
been a full medal event at the Olympic Games since 1896 for men and since
2000 for women.
A) State whether the following statements are TRUE or FALSE.
1. Water rafting is an outdoor sport.
2. Skydivers do not need parachutes to land.

The Challenge
Blessed is the man, indeed,
Who in this life can find;
A purpose that can fill his days,
And goals to fill his mind!
The world is filled with little men
Content with here they are;
Not knowing joys success can bring,
No will to go that far!
Yet, in this world there is a need,
For men to lead the rest
To rise above the "average" life,
By giving of their best!
Would you be one, who dares to try,
When challenged by the task;
To rise to heights you've never seen,
Or is that too much to ask?
This is your day a world to win
Great purpose to achieve;
Accept the challenge of your goals
And in yourself, believe!
You will be proud of what you've done,
When at the close of day;
You look back on your battles won,
Content, you came this way!

Kishan started practising that presentation.
Good morning, dear teacher and my dear friends! This presentation
is on the irrigation system of Sri Lanka which dates back to 300 BC. We, Sri
Lankans are proud of the many wondrous water managing systems of the
ancient civilizations. We were the first to build water reservoirs to store water
which are known as tanks (wewa/kulam). Many Sri Lankan kings such as King
Pandukabhaya, King Wasabha, King Mahasen, King Dhathusena, King Agbo I,
King Agbo II and King Parakramabahu the Great built tanks to improve farming
in Sri Lanka. The ancient kings followed the advice of the Buddhist monks and
ruled the country. This led to the ancient concept of ‘tank and stupa’.
I’m sure that you all know the reason why these great kings built tanks. Can you
tell me why? Well, it’s pretty obvious that the kings had a vision to cultivate the
land and to make the country self-sufficient. Now I’ll show you a cross section
of a tank.
Well, friends I have some more key points to discuss. I need your help to finish
the rest.

4 FOR A BETTER TOMORROW
Activity 1
Act out
Practise this television interview.
Presenter
: Good Morning! Once again we join you in your favourite
programme “For a Better Tomorrow.” Our topic today is “Polythene and the
Environment.,, To share some valuable ideas on this topic, we have with us one
of the eminent environmentalists in the country, Mr. Sunil Weerasinghe.
Welcome to the programme, Mr. Weerasinghe.
Sunil Weerasinghe
: Thank you. It’s a pleasure to be here.
Interviewer
: As we are well aware, polythene has become a major
environmental issue. Talking about polythene and the
environment, what is the biggest problem related to
polythene?
Sunil Weerasinghe
: The biggest problem is that most types of polythene
don’t decay. They accumulate in the environment,
and that, in turn, creates many other problems.
Interviewer
: I’m sure our viewers would like to know about these
problems. Could you tell us something about them?
For free distribution
Sunil Weerasinghe
Well, it seems that a lot of
people have
the habit of
throwing
polythene
carelessly and haphazardly
into the environment. This
often
leads
to problems
like land pollution and land
infertility. Polythene also blocks sewage systems and water sources. Another
problem is that rain water collected in polythene bags provides breeding grounds
for mosquitoes. This is really unfortunate. We will be living in an extremely
unhealthy environment if such a situation is to continue.
Interviewer
: Can’t we burn polythene instead?
Sunil Weerasinghe : Unfortunately, that doesn’t help much. Burning
polythene creates a lot of harmful gases and
substances. They are harmful to all living things.
Interviewer
: How about the effect of polythene on animal life?
Sunil Weerasinghe : Sadly, a lot of animals die after eating polythene as it is
not digested.
Interviewer
: So, what are your suggestions? Should we stop using
polythene?
Sunil Weerasinghe : Not exactly. I think we should try to minimize the
use of polythene. Taking reusable bags when
marketing is a possible way of reducing the use of
polythene. Recycling polythene is another solution.
Interviewer
: Reduce, reuse and recycle. We should all think about
it. With that thought we come to the end of
our programme. Thank you for joining us today, Mr.
Weerasinghe.
Sunil Weerasinghe : Thank you for inviting me.
Interviewer
: We hope to meet our viewers next week at the same

Animals on the Verge of Extinction
Polar Bears
Polar bears live across the Arctic in Canada,
Alaska, Greenland, Russia, Denmark and Norway.
They are the first animals to be threatened
because of global warming. They need a cold
climate, snow and ice of the Arctic regions to
survive. When the snow and ice in the polar
regions melt, these animals lose their natural
habitat. Scientists say that polar bears are in
danger of becoming extinct in about 50 years.
Lions
Lions were wide-ranging animals. In the past,They
wandered freely in Africa, Asia, Europe and
India. Now they are confined to Africa and
to a small area in India. Loss of habitat, loss
of prey and sport hunting have made this
majestic animal endangered. Scientists warn
that if these activities are to continue, African
lions could very well be extinct by 2050.
Blue Whales
Blue whales live in all the oceans except the
polar seas. They have become endangered due
to being hunted for blubber and body parts. For
this reason they have been declared protected
animals since 1966. Global warming also harms
blue whales. Temperature changes in water due
to global warming may induce migration to wrong
places where food supply could be low. It is believed
that 10000 to 25000 blue whales swim in the oceans
of the world.

Read the following article and answer the questions that follow.
Anyone who prepares for an exam will have to plan and study according to a
timetable. What is the best time of the day to study? For some, it is the daytime
and for some others it’s at night. However, there are some students who struggle
to find a suitable time to study due to many reasons.
After a good night's sleep, people tend to have more energy and become more
active during the day. Since most of the people are contactable during the
day, it is easy to communicate with teachers, friends and others to clarify any
questions that you may have. Furthermore, the natural light you get during the
day is better than the artificial light that you use at night.
For free distribution
On the other hand, studying during the night can also be beneficial. During the
night, the environment is very quiet. This creates a setting to study peacefully.
Hence, there are fewer distractions than the day time. When you study during the
night, your creativity will increase and this in turn will help you to understand
theories and concepts easily. Your analysing ability also will be greater.
However, the best time to study depends on an individual's personality, nature of
the exam, time management, the natural sleep cycle of the person, the resources
the person has etc.
Whatever the time you choose to study, it is important to be methodical. First,
set a target and keep on recalling your target. Next, give yourself enough time
to study and organize your study space. It will also be advantageous to work
according to a timetable, use flow charts and diagrams to concentrate on daily
lessons, practise past question papers, discuss your answers with others, get
necessary clarifications from teachers, organize study groups and associate with
friends who have a spirit to study. You should not forget to take regular breaks,
eat nutritious food, drink plenty of water and spend time with your family too.
Above all, be positive and have faith in yourself. Then, no one can stop you
from achieving your target.
A) Complete the table given below on advantages of studying during daytime/
night.

Forms of Entertainment
Entertainment is a performance or an activity that provides enjoyment to an
audience.There are many forms of entertainment. Among them, films, dramas,
music, dancing and opera are the most popular. All of these are art forms in
which the medium of expression is different.
A drama is a piece of writing that tells a story and is meant for performance.
Originally, dramas were meant to be acted on stage before a live audience.
Radio and television dramas were later developments.
A film is a similar art form,where a series of images creates the illusion of
continuous movement on a screen. Both dramas and films provide an audio-
visual realistic experience to spectators who often tend to identify themselves
with the characters.
For free distribution
Music is another popular form of entertainment. Music is considered “the
universal language of mankind”. That is because a piece of music has the ability
to appeal to listeners who are not even familiar with its language or the culture.
That is why some musicians are famous all over the world even though their
fans may not understand the language in which they sing.
The rhythmic movement of the body and feet to music is called dancing.
Dancing exists in all cultures in different forms and styles.
Opera is an art form in which music, singing, drama, poetry and dancing are all
combined together. Opera can be defined as musical drama. This is a classical
form of entertainment preferred mostly by adults.
People need to engage in enjoyable activities in order to balance their busy
lives. Entertainment helps people to become relaxed. At the same time, it is not
good to spend too much time on entertainment.We may become addicted to it
and neglect important things such as education or work. Maintaining a proper
balance between work and pleasure will help us to lead a productive life.
1) Read the above article and complete the following sentences.

Leisure
What is this life if, full of care,
We have no time to stand and stare?
No time to stand beneath the boughs,
And stare as long as sheep and cows:
No time to see, when woods we pass,
Where squirrels hide their nuts in grass:
No time to see, in broad daylight,
Streams full of stars, like skies at night:
No time to turn at Beauty's glance,
And watch her feet, how they can dance:
No time to wait till her mouth can
Enrich that smile her eyes began?
A poor life this if, full of care,
We have no time to stand and stare.

Given below is the article shown to Anuradha by Rashmika.
When we study the history of the world, we can see
that many religious leaders, political leaders and social
activists lived simple lives as minimalists. This quality
attracted many disciples and followers around the
world.
Mahathma Gandhi is considered as the Father of the
Nation by the Indians. He was an inspiring philosopher
and a leader who led a simple life. Gandhi was actually
born into an affluent family and had a very privileged
upbringing. Gandhi accumulated little, ate the amount
he needed to eat, dressed simply and led a simple stress free life. He was a
man who believed in being non-possessive and didn’t even own a house. When
Gandhi died, he had less than ten personal possessions including a watch, a pair

of spectacles, a pair of sandals and his eating bowl. Although some considered
him to have died a pauper, he influenced the lives of many. Even today his way
of life continues to inspire many others around the world. However, at present
it is believed to be difficult to minimise the living conditions to such an extent.
One must learn to use, buy, or do things that they really ought to do rather than
doing them just because the others do.
Life becomes easy when one learns to reuse,
recycle and give things away. Self-sufficiency
also is a good trait of a person who leads a
simple life. If one can manage his own work

garden or mending a shoe etc, it makes life
easier. In addition if one is in the habit of
growing fruits and vegetables for one's own
consumption, that person saves a lot of money for a worthy cause. A person

The Last Wishes of Alexander the Great
The name of Alexander the Great (356-323 B.C.) still lives in the legends of
the East, and traces of his swift conquest are still stamped upon the fabric
of Western Asia. His name is famous as a conqueror and as the King of
Macedonia. Alexander the Great was born in the Pella region of Macedonia on
July 20, 356 B.C., to King Philip II of Macedon and Queen Olympia. This
young, dark-eyed and curly-haired prince was tutored by the great philosopher,
Aristotle. Alexander the Great conquered half the known world in thirteen
years. This ruler swept aside the mighty armies of the Persian Empire and
established his rule as far as Punjab.
Alexander the Great was far more than a general
and a leader of armies. His colossal victories
were followed by sympathetic, understanding
administration and had won the loyalty of the
defeated. Alexander, after conquering many
kingdoms, was returning home. On the way, he fell
ill. Knowing that his death was nearing, he longed
to see his mother’s face. However, he realized
that his sinking health would not permit him to
reach his mother as he was far from his homeland.
Alexander the great realized that all his wealth
and his conquests, his great army, his sharp sword
would not help him to save his life.
He called his generals and said, "I will depart from this world soon, I have three

wishes, please carry them out without fail."
With tears flowing down their cheeks, the generals agreed to abide by their
king's last wishes.
1) "My first desire is that", said Alexander, "my physicians alone must carry my
coffin."
2) After a pause, he continued, "Secondly, I desire that when my coffin is being
carried to the grave, the path leading to the graveyard be strewn with gold,
silver and precious stones which I have collected in my treasury".
3) The king felt exhausted after
saying this. He took a minute's
rest and continued. "My third and
last wish is that both my hands be
kept dangling out of my coffin".
All who were around were in
tears. But, there was none who
was brave enough to inquire the
reasons for the wishes except for
the favourite general. As a reply this great ruler said, “I would like the world
to know of the three lessons I have just learnt. I want my physicians to carry
my coffin because people should realize that no doctor on this earth can really
cure anybody. They are powerless and cannot save a person from the clutches
of death. So let not people take life for granted. The second wish of strewing
gold, silver and other riches on the path to the graveyard is to tell people that not
even a fraction of gold will come with me. I spent all my life in greed for power,
earning riches but I cannot take anything with me. Let people realize that it is a
sheer waste of time to chase wealth. About my third wish of having my hands
dangling out of the coffin, I wish people to know that I came empty handed into
this world and empty handed I go out of this world".
Leaving these three important lessons, this great conqueror let death conquer

My thoughts were now wholly employed about securing myself against either
savages, if any should appear, or wild beasts, if any were in the island; and I
had many thoughts of the method how to do this, and what kind of dwelling to
make - whether I should make me a cave in the earth, or a tent upon the earth;
and, in short, I resolved upon both; the manner and description of which, it may
not be improper to give an account of.
I soon found the place I was in was not fit for my settlement, because it was upon
a low, moorish ground, near the sea, and I believed it would not be wholesome,
and more particularly because there was no fresh water near it; so I resolved to
find a more healthy and more convenient spot of ground.

fourthly, a view to the sea, that if God sent any ship in sight, I might not lose
any advantage for my deliverance, of which I was not willing to banish all my
expectation yet.
In search of a place proper for this, I found a little plain on the side of a rising
hill, whose front towards this little plain was steep as a house-side, so that
nothing could come down upon me from the top. On the one side of the rock
there was a hollow place, worn a little way in, like the entrance or door of a cave
but there was not really any cave or way into the rock at all.

A terrible scream—a prolonged yell of horror and anguish—burst out of the
silence of the moor. That frightful cry turned the blood to ice in my veins.
“Oh, my God!” I gasped. “What is it? What does it mean?”
Holmes had sprung to his feet, and I saw his dark, athletic outline at the door
of the hut, his shoulders stooping, his head thrust forward, his face peering
into the darkness.
“Hush!” he whispered. “Hush!”
The cry had been loud on account of its vehemence, but it had pealed out from
somewhere far off on the shadowy plain. Now it burst upon our ears, nearer,
louder, more urgent than before.
“Where is it?” Holmes whispered; and I knew from the thrill of his voice that
he, the man of iron, was shaken to the soul.
“Where is it, Watson?”
“There, I think.” I pointed into the darkness.
“No, there!”
Again the agonized cry swept through
the silent night, louder and much nearer
than ever. And a new sound mingled
with it, a deep, muttered rumble,
musical and yet menacing, rising and
falling like the low, constant murmur of
the sea.
“The hound!” cried Holmes. “Come, Watson, come! Great heavens, if we are
too late!”
He had started running swiftly over the moor, and I had followed at his heels.
But now from somewhere among the broken ground immediately in front of us
there came one last despairing yell, and then a dull, heavy thud. We halted and
listened. Not another sound broke the heavy silence of the windless night.

I saw Holmes put his hand to his forehead like a man distracted. He stamped his
feet upon the ground.
“He has beaten us, Watson. We are too late.”
“No, no, surely not!”
“Fool that I was to hold my hand. And you, Watson, see what comes of
abandoning your charge! But, by Heaven, if the worst has happened, we’ll
avenge him!”
Blindly we ran through the gloom, blundering against boulders, forcing
our way through gorse bushes, panting up hills and rushing down slopes,
heading always in the direction when those dreadful sounds had come.
At every rise Holmes looked eagerly round him, but the shadows were thick
upon the moor, and nothing moved upon its dreary face.

Read the paragraph about Anne Frank and answer the questions.
Anne Frank was a Jewish girl who had to go into hiding during World War II
from the Nazis. Together with seven others she hid in a secret annex. After
almost two years in hiding they were discovered and deported to concentration
camps. Anne’s father, Otto Frank, was the only one of the eight people to
survive. After her death Anne became world famous because of the diary she
had written while in hiding.
Anne Frank was born on 12 June 1929 in Frankfurt.
The economic crisis, Hitler’s rise to power and
growing anti-Semitism (hatred against Jews) put an
end to the family’s carefree life. So, following what
most of the Jews did, they decided to leave Germany
to save their lives.
Anne and others in hiding stayed very quietly, they
were often afraid and despite good and bad times,
spent the time together. They were helped by the
office workers Johannes Kleiman, Victor Kugler,
Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl, by Miep's husband Jan
Gies and warehouse boss Johannes Voskuijl, Bep's
father. These helpers arranged food, clothes and
books for them.
For free distribution
Shortly before going into hiding Anne received a diary for her birthday. She
started writing straightaway and during her time in hiding she wrote about
events in the secret annex, about herself and about humanity. Her diary was a
great support and source of relief to her.
On 4th of August 1944 the people in hiding
were arrested. They were deported to
Auschwitz. Immediately after the arrest
Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl rescued
Anne's diary and papers that had been
left behind in the secret annex. Despite
intensive investigations it had never
been clear how the hiding place had
been discovered.
Today, people from all over the world
learn of Anne Frank's story. Over the
years Otto Frank answered thousands of letters from people who had read his
daughter's diary. In 1960 the Anne Frank House became a museum. Otto Frank
remained involved with the Anne Frank House and campaigns for human rights
until his death in 1980.

Read the following text and answer the questions that follow.
What can you say about the pictures shown above? They are strange circles and
patterns seen on farming areas/sites. These patterns are called “Crop Circles”.
The circles are mostly found in the United Kingdom, but have spread to dozens
of countries around the world during the past decades.
It is said that crop circles appear every week somewhere around the world.
These circles are considered mysterious since the strange circles and patterns
appear mysteriously overnight in farmers' fields, provoking puzzlement. These
patterns almost always involve circles, rarely triangles, rectangles, or squares,
though some designs contain straight or curved lines.
Nobody knows how they are made, who brought them to the farming fields.
Some believe that this can be a creation of hoaxers. But, mysteriously this
nocturnal act is reported to be insensitive to cameras. Besides, hoaxers who
devote their time and effort required to design and create the crop circles are
unlikely to carelessly leave obvious signs of their activities. Some believe that
these patterns are made by aliens.
In 1966 a farmer said he saw a flying saucer rise up from a swampy area and fly
away. Later he had seen a roughly circular area of debris and apparently flattened
reeds and grass. He assumed that it had been made by the alien spacecraft.
However, this was refused by the investigators who stated that this could have
been caused by a natural phenomenon.

of countries around the world during the past decades.
It is said that crop circles appear every week somewhere around the world.
These circles are considered mysterious since the strange circles and patterns
appear mysteriously overnight in farmers' fields, provoking puzzlement. These
patterns almost always involve circles, rarely triangles, rectangles, or squares,
though some designs contain straight or curved lines.
Nobody knows how they are made, who brought them to the farming fields.
Some believe that this can be a creation of hoaxers. But, mysteriously this
nocturnal act is reported to be insensitive to cameras. Besides, hoaxers who
devote their time and effort required to design and create the crop circles are
unlikely to carelessly leave obvious signs of their activities. Some believe that
these patterns are made by aliens.
In 1966 a farmer said he saw a flying saucer rise up from a swampy area and fly
away. Later he had seen a roughly circular area of debris and apparently flattened
reeds and grass. He assumed that it had been made by the alien spacecraft.
However, this was refused by the investigators who stated that this could have
been caused by a natural phenomenon.
Those who claim that aliens physically make the patterns themselves from
spaceships also suggest that they do it using invisible energy beams from space,
saving them the trip down here. Still others believe that it is purely a human act.
However, the cause behind crop circles remains a mystery until today.

SETTING YOUR PERSONAL GOALS
If you want to live a happy life, tie it to a goal. Not to people or things”
Albert Einstein
Setting your goals is the process
of having a clear vision about your
ideal future, and motivating yourself
to turn your vision into a reality.
It helps you to choose where you
want to go in life. When you know
precisely what you want to achieve,
you know where you have to focus
your efforts. You’ll also identify the
distractions that might lead you astray and correct them before it is too late.
First, start your process of setting personal goals by brainstorming and writing
down what you really enjoy doing. Then evaluate each activity, narrow down
your list and identify what you really want to do. Make sure that the goals that
you have set are the ones that you genuinely want to achieve, not ones that your
parents, family, or others might want you to achieve.

The departure of educated or professional people to more developed
Brain Drain
countries
Brain drain refers to the emigration (out-migration) of knowledgeable, well-
educated and skilled professionals from their home country to another
country. This can take place due to several factors. The most obvious is the
availability of better job opportunities in the new country. Other factors that can
cause brain drain include: war or conflict, health risks, and political instability.
Brain drain occurs most commonly when individuals leave less developed
countries with fewer opportunities for career advancement, research, and
academic employment and migrate to more developed countries with more
opportunities. However, it also occurs in the movement of individuals from one
developed country to another developed country.
A country that experiences brain drain faces
many problems. In less developed countries, this
phenomenon is much more common and the loss is
much more substantial. There can be an economic
loss for the country as educated professionals
leave for better salaries elsewhere. In addition, the
development of the country is affected when most
of the educated individuals do not use their knowledge for the benefit of their
own country.
The loss that occurs in more developed countries is not felt much because these
countries generally see an emigration of these educated professionals along
with an immigration of other educated professionals.
There are many things governments can do to combat brain drain. If there is an
increase in job advancement opportunities and research opportunities in one’s
own country, we can reduce the brain drain. The process is difficult and it takes
time to establish these sorts of facilities and opportunities, but it is possible, and
is becoming increasingly necessary. If we encourage highly-skilled workers to
serve their own country, they will not seek better opportunities elsewhere.
