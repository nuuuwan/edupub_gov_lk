What is Earth Hour?
Earth hour is held annually to encourage individuals, communities,
households and businesses to turn off their lights for one hour, from 8:30
to 9:30 p.m. on the last Saturday in March. This is done as a symbol of our
commitment to the planet we live in. Hundreds of millions of people from all
over the world show their support by switching off the lights for one hour on
this particular day.
They engage in this activity irrespective of all thebarriers such as race, religion,
culture, society, generation and geography. Therefore, it is a global celebration
showing the commitment of people towards one thing that unites everyone –
the planet.
Earth Hour generally aims to show the actions people, businesses and
governments world-wide are taking to reduce
their environmental impact. This helps to
encourage others to join an interconnected
global community motivated to find solutions
to environmental challenges.

However Earth Hour is not merely for saving
an hour’s electricity; it is a broader concept that
helps us to understand that most of our actions
have an effect on the world. For example, the
energy we use, the food we buy and the water
we drink have an impact on our planet. We all
depend on our planet and need to look after it –
not just for an hour a year, but every day.
So, when we switch on the lights again, if we stop to think about the things we
can change in our daily life, it will benefit the planet in many ways. Across the
world, biodiversity and natural habitats are disappearing at a greater rate than
ever before. If we are not careful, we will be depleting the earth of wild animals,
water, wood and other natural resources faster than they can be replenished.
Things will only worsen if we continue in the same direction.

Conditional Sentences
A conditional sentence is a sentence structure used to talk about something
(a result) that may happen ONLY IF something else happens first (a condition).
“IF” type one (Possible situations)
This is a picture of a market in an imaginary
island. In this island people do not use a
monetary system. Instead they still use the
barter system which is an old method of
exchanging services and goods for other
services and goods in return.
This is how they exchange their goods.
John - If I give you some grains, will you
give me some apples?
Tom - Sure! If you give me a handful of
grains, I will give you four apples
in return.
Grace - Hey, if I give you some flour, will
you give me that bag of rice in
exchange?
Mary - Why not Grace? I need flour. If you
give it, I will exchange this bag of
rice for it.
For free distribution Study the two exchanges. In each exchange, there is a possible condition.
The result will occur only if this condition is fulfilled.
In type one of the conditional sentences we talk about possible, real conditions
that have possible results. The tense in the 'if' clause is in the simple present,
and the tense in the main clause is in the simple future.
Condition (IF Clause)
Result (Main Clause)
If you give me a handful of grains
I will give you four apples in
return.
If you give me some flour

“IF” type two (Imaginery
situations)
Let’s go back to the market.
What will happen if you do
not have something suitable
to exchange to get what you
want?
Read this dialogue.
Luke -
If I give you my cow, will you give me honey for the value? My cow
will give you a lot of milk.
George - Oh sorry, Mr. Luke. I don’t have enough honey to match the value of
your cow. How about something smaller? A chicken perhaps?
Luke - What can I do? This is all I have. If I had a chicken, I would give it
to you.
George - Then there’s no deal. If I were you, I would give this cow to farmer
Luke -
Stephan. He would give you some bags of rice.
If I needed rice, I would give it to him. I don’t need rice since I’ve
more than enough in the cellar. See you then.
In this dialogue, there are unlikely conditions. Fulfilling these conditions is
theoretically possible but practically it is highly unlikely to fulfil them.
In type two of the conditional sentences, we talk about unlikely conditions
that are unlikely to be fulfilled. The tense in the 'if' clause is in the simple
past, and the tense in the main clause is ‘would + infinitive’.
Condition (IF Clause)
Result (Main Clause)
If I had a chicken
I would give it to you.
If I were you
I would give this cow to farmer

“IF” type three (Impossible situations)
After returning from the market Mr. Luke felt sorry because he could not
get what he wanted. This is how he told his experience to his wife.
If I had got something smaller, I would have exchanged it for honey.
In this situation, it is impossible that the condition will be fulfilled because
it refers to the past. The tense in the 'if ' clause is in the past perfect, and
the tense in the main clause is 'would + have +past participle'
Condition (IF Clause)
Result (Main Clause)
If I had got something smaller
I would have exchanged it for
honey.

Reading
Read this story about Mr. Mumble Jumble. Then decide the things that
could have been different for him on this particular day. Write them in your
notebook. Follow the example given.
Eg :- If he had checked the bag before leaving the counter, he would have
seen the saree.
One day, Mr. Mumble Jumble had a series of misfortunes. He was
invited to attend the wedding ceremony of one of his close friends. He decided
to go shopping to buy a new shirt to wear on that day. At the shop, the salesman
showed him a number of shirts. Mr. Mumble Jumble selected a nice, blue shirt.
It was just the colour he liked. He gave it to the salesman who volunteered
to take it to the cashier while Mr. Mumble Jumble looked for the credit card
in his pocket. When Mr. Mumble Jumble arrived at home, he unpacked his
shopping, and found that the cashier had given him a blue saree instead of the
shirt! Unfortunately, he had not checked his bag before leaving the counter.
“No problem,” Mr. Mumble Jumble thought. “I will take it back to the shop
tomorrow and exchange it”
However, when he went back to the shop, it was crowded and there was
a long queue at the cashier. Mr. Mumble Jumble decided to walk round the shop
until he was able to speak to the cashier.
It was then that the security officer became suspicious of him. He asked Mr.
Mumble Jumble to show the contents of the bag. When he asked for the bill,
he produced it but unfortunately, the contents of the bag did not match the bill.
Poor Mr. Mumble Jumble was called as a shoplifter and taken to the Chief
Security Officer, becouse they thought that he had stolen a saree from the shop
“You have stolen this expensive saree, haven’t you?” he asked.

“I don’t wear sarees. My friend is getting married next week. So I wanted to buy
a shirt” mumbled Mr. Mumble Jumble.
The Chief Security officer was even more suspicious as it was not a clear
answer. He detained Mr. Mumble Jumble for two more hours until the manager
of the shop arrived. After some more mumbling Mr. Mumble Jumble managed
to explain what really happened to him.
After two more hours, Mr. Mumble Jumble went home with his new, blue shirt
securely tucked under his arm.
