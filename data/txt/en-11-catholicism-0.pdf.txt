Pentatuech
Teacher - Children, today I have brought you a very valuable book to teach you
a very important lesson. But it is a volume, a collection of five books.
You find in that book about the creation of the world or the universe, the
creation of man and his falling into sin. You find such beautiful stories
in parables. It is important for us to understand the message that God
is revealing to us through these stories than to find out whether these
stories are true or not. Not only that, choosing and appointing patriarchs,
Israelites becoming the slaves in Egypt and under the leadership of
Moses, Israelites' going back to the promised land.
Marie - We like very much to know about them, teacher.
Teacher - Good. Five of your friends are ready to relate to you about this.
Noel -
I am the Book of Genesis. I am the one who recorded about the beginning
of the universe and the creation of man. I want to tell you not how the
universe was created, but I want to tell you that God is the creator of the
universe. My message is for all times.
Rayan -
I am the Book Exodus. I speak about the chosen people of God's, the
Israelites' freeing from the bondage of slavery in Egypt and journing
back to the promised land through the desert. It is a wonderful story. The
whole Pentateuch is written on the marvelous experience of mine.
Brian -
I am the Book of Leviticus. I speak about the rules and regulations of the
liturgy of the Old Testament.
Kevin -
I am the Book of Numbers. I write about the journey of Israelites in the
desert. It was a very difficult journey. It was full of experience of God.
Sherin - They call me the Book of Deuteronomy. I tell them to be faithful to God
always and to live according to His word. Those who live accordingly
will receive God's blessings.
Teacher - Very Good. With that knowledge let us begin our lesson.
The first five books of the Holy Bible are
Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers
and Deuteronomy. They are known as the
“Pentateuch”. In Hebrew, they are known
as “Torah” which means “The Law” or
“Instructions”. Other names used for the
Pentateuch are The Law, and The Law of
Moses. Pentateuch is made up of faith of
generations of people and their experience
of God.
Picture 1.1 - Pentateuch
Biblical scholars are of the opinion that four theological traditions have helped in
writing the first five books of the Holy Bible, the Pentateuch. The four traditions are
Yahwist (J), Elohist (E), Deuteronomist (D) and Priestly (P)
Yahwist Tradition (J)
This tradition uses the name 'Yahweh' for God. The literary style is story telling.
It is simple, vivid and dramatic. The following stories belong to this tradition:
² Second creation story (Genesis 2:4b-25)
² Adam and Eve (Genesis 3)
² Cain and Abel (Genesis 4).
In an anthropomorphic way this tradition brings out that God has a very close
relationship with man. Eg: God called man and ask where are you (Genesis 3:9).
We too must be close to God and experience his love.
Elohist Tradition (E)
God is called 'Elohim.' God is all powerful. He lives far away from man. God
reveals to man by means of dreams, visions and angels. E.g. God said to Moses
“Come no closer. Remove the sandles from your feet for the place on which you
are standing is holy groud.” (Ex. 3:5) The literary style of this tradition is straight,
brief and without explanations.
² E.g. Sacrifice of Isaac ( (Genesis 22:1-19)
² Jacob’s dream at Bethel (Genesis 28:10-20)
God speaks to us in various ways in day today life. We should get tuned to listen to
his voice.
Deuteronomist Tradition (D)
The literary style is instructive. This tradition is limited to the Book of Deuteronomy.
According to this tradition, one must be faithful to the covenant and should worship
one and only one God (Dt. 6:4-6)
Priestly Tradition (P)
According to this tradition God is all powerful. Since its concern is about the priestly
teaching, it deals with the religious practices, liturgy and priestly life.
² E.g. The first creation story (Genesis 1:1-2:4a)
² Covenant with Noah (Genesis 9:1-17)
God created the world in six days and rested on the 7th day. Therefore, sabbath day
has to be kept holy. Let us try to keep the Sabbath day which is Sunday for us, holy.
The Importance of Pentateuch
The Pentateuch is full of various theological themes. Accordingly we must worship
only one God, the creator and the saviour of the universe. It is the duty of not only
of the Israelites but also all human beings. Because of his love and kindness, God
chose the nation of Israel for the salvation of the universe. When they became
slaves in Egypt God brought them back to the promised land as a fulfillment of his
promise to their forefathers. God guides the weak human beings through law and
blesses the faithful with his graces. Let us obey the creator God and by fulfilling his
commandments, let us become heirs of his blessings and graces.
Activity

² Let us keep Sunday holy.
The Deuterocanonical Books
Number of books is the Holy Bible
Hebrew Bible
Christian Bible
Catholic Bible
Testament
Testament
Total
In the Holy Scripture, the list of canonical books means the books, written through
the inspiration of God. The problem of the list of canonical books arises with regard
to the books in the Old Testament.
Jews and the non-catholic Christians (Protestants) accept only 39 books of the old
Testament as canonical books, but the Catholics accept 46 books from the Greek
Text, called Septuagint. Jews and Protestants use the Hebrew Text. It is called
Masoretic Text and there are 39 books in it. The origin of these two texts are Jewish.
There are 7 extra books in the Catholic Bible. They are called “Deuterocanonical
Books.”
1. Tobit
2. Judith
3. The Wisdom of Soloman
4. Sirach (Ecclesiasticus)
5. Baruch
6. 1 Maccabees
7. 2 Maccabees
“Deutero” means “secondly” Yet Deuterocanonical book were in the Septuagint
Text long before the Masoretic Text was finalized. At the beginning there was no
difference between canonical and deuterocanonical books.
Septuagint Text
Hebrew Old Testament was translated into Greek in the 3rd century B.C. King
Demetrius of Ptolemy II took 6 scribes from each of the twelve tribes. 72 of them
translated the Hebrew Bible into Greek. Though the 72 of them did it individually
when they got together with the translations they found that all 72 have translated
in the same way. It is known as “Septuagint” (meaning: LXX = 70). The 46 books
of the Catholic Old Testament are from the Septuagint Text.
Evidence to prove that Deuterocanonical books were written through
Divine Inspiration.
1. The New Testament authors often used the Greek Text. Out of 350 quotations
from the Old Testament 300 were taken from the Greek Text. Out of 300
quotations 18 were taken from the Deuterocanonical books. If there had been
a debate about the canonicity of the deuterocanonical books, they would not
have quoted from them.
In the Greek Text, canonical books and deuterocanonical books are not
separated. E.g. after the book of Nehemiah two Deutorocanonical books
namely Tobit and Judith and then book of Esther. This shows that they had
equal acceptance.
3. We have evidence that the early Christian Church has used Deuterocanonical
books for their liturgy.
All these show that even before the New Testament time, Deuterocanonical books
were considered as the Word of God. There is no doubt that they were written
through inspiration of God. We should accept them as word of God and use them
for our enlightenment.
Activity
1. Name the seven Deuterocanonical books.
2. Write three reasons why the Septuagint Text is important for
us, Catholics.
For your life
² Let us accept Deuterocanonical books as the word of
² Let us use the Deuterocanonical books fruitfully.
² Let us make our life meaningful by making use of
Deuterocanonical books.
The Prophets of Israel
First student ¡
I am ready to tell you about your future. Everything happens
according to your destiny. Nobody can change your destiny.
Come, I will tell you about your future.
Second Student¡ I am a person who speaks for God. I have brought you a message
from the living God. My purpose is to proclaim divine will.
Third Student¡
Is there a difference between the two of them? When you look at
them, both of them are alike.
Forth Student ¡ Why not? The first one is a fortune teller. The second one is a
prophet.
Fifth Student ¡ Are they not telling the same thing? I cannot see any difference?
Sixth Student ¡ How can it be? One is telling you about your future destiny. The
other one is saying about the word of God. The fortune teller
speaks about your future destiny. We, Catholics do not listen or
believe in fortune telling. There is nothing, called destiny or fate.
To believe in destiny is a sin. Everything happens according to the
will of God. Our duty is to listen to God’s message, and leave our
future in the hand of God.
Prophets of Israel spoke for God and delivered God's message to the people of
Israel irrespective of their state, clan, colour or wealth and what will they get
in return. The Hebrew word for the prophet was “Nabi” which means “the one
who proclaims God’s will to others”. In Greek they were called “prophetes” which
means “One who speaks for others”. According to that a prophet is one who speaks
on behalf of God.
While prophesing, they used three types of sayings
1. “Thus says the Lord” (Amos 1:3)
2. “I, the Lord has spoken” (Ezekiel 5:15)
3. “The word of the Lord came to ........” (Ezekiel 12:1)
Prophets of Israel can be divided into two.
1. Early prophets.
2. Classical prophets
Early prophets
There are no books in the name of early prophets, but their teaching and
activities are found in the books of Samuel and of Kings. Some of those prophets
1. Nathan
2. Elijah
3. Elishah
4. Huldah
5. Ahijah
6. Micaiah
Early prophets have three characteristics
1. Ecstatic experience (1 Samuel 10 :5-15)
2. Working in groups (1 Samuel 19:18¡24)
3. They performed miracles to prove their mission (1 Kings 17:16¡24)
Classical Prophets
These prophets have books in their name. They can be devided into 2 groups.
Classical prophets
Major Prophets
1. Isaiah
2. Jeremiah
3. Ezekiel
Minor Prophets
1. Hosea
2. Joel
3. Amos
4. Obadiah
5. Jonah
6. Micah
7. Nahum
8. Habakkuk
9. Zephaniah
10. Haggai
11. Zechariah
12. Malachi
The size of their book decides whether one is a major prophet or a minor prophet.
The call of prophet Isaiah (Isaiah 6:1-13)
Prophet Isaiah saw a vision in the Temple. He saw the
Lord sitting on a high and lofty throne. The angels in
their mighty voice praised God saying: Holy, holy,
holy is the Lord of hosts.” The foundation of the temple
shook at their voices and the Temple filled with smoke.
Then he said, “Woe is me! I am lost, for I am a man of
unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips;
yet my eyes have seen the king, the Lord of hosts.
Picture 3.1 - prophet Isaiah
Then one of the seraphs flew to him, holding a burning
coal that had been taken from the altar with a pair of
tongs. The seraph touched his mouth with it and said “Behold, this has touched your
lips, your guilt is taken away and your sin is blotted out.” Then he heard the voice of
the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send and who will go for us? And he said, “Here am
I, send me.” And God said “Go and say to this people.” Then prophet Isaiah fulfilled
his mission, proclaiming God’s message to the people of Israel. The true God that
Isaiah experienced is present in all our churches and the Son of God, the Lord Jesus
Christ is present in every church where the Blessed Sacrament is kept. So it is our
duty to behave very respectfully in the church.
The call of prophet Jeremiah (Jeremiah
1:1-19)
Now the word of the Lord came to me saying,
“Before I formed you in the womb I knew you
and before you were born I consecrated you: I
appointed you a prophet to the nations.” Then
he said, “Ah Lord God! Truly I do not know
how to speak, for I am only a boy.” But the
Lord said to him, “Do not say, ‘I am only a
boy:’ for you shall go all to whom I send you,
and you shall speak whatever I command you.
Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you to
deliver you.” Then the Lord put forth his hand
and touched Jeremiah's mouth; and the Lord
Picture 3.2 - Prophet Jeremiha
said to him: “Now I have put my words in your mouth. See, today I appoint you
over nations and over kingdoms, to pluck up and to pull down, to destroy and to
overthrow, to build and to plant.” Like prophet Jeremiah, we too must accept our
nothingness and weaknesses before God. If God gives us some responsibilities,
he will also give us strength and power to do them. Let us have faith in God's
mighty power.
The call of prophet Ezekiel ¡ Ezekiel 2:1¡3:5)
God gave his message to prophet Ezekiel
symbolically. God said to Ezekiel: “eat
this scroll, and go, speak to the house of
Israel. He ate it and it was sweet as honey
in the mouth. God gave him his mission,”
I am sending you to the people of Israel to
a nation of rebels who have rebeled against
me. Ezekiel, who had a deep faith in God
and a very strong and firm will, went to
the exiled people of Israel in Babylon and
was able to enkindle in them some hope of
returning to their own land.
All of us who have received the sacrament
of Baptism have become prophets. We too
must carry the message of God to others and
help those who do not listen to the word of
God to come back to God.

Gospels
The Gospel according to St. Mark
Author :
St. John Mark
Symbol : Lion
It is because he begins his gospel
with the sermon of St. John, the
Baptist, crying like a roaring lion
in the wilderness. Therefore this
gospel gets the figure of a lion as its
symbol in the religious tradition.
Time : 64 - 66 AD
Another name : Gospel of Passion
Place :
In Rome
The purpose of writing this gospel was to strengthen the faith of the first
Christians who were persecuted in Rome under the Roman Emperor, Niro. St. Mark
was one of Peter's followers who helped him as his translator. His main task was
to strengthen and give hope to the persecuted Christians, assuring them that only
through the cross that they can have victory.
Even today in many countries the Christians are persecuted and even killed for their
faith. Let us follow the example of the early Christians during Emperor Niro's time.
Let us be brave Christians who stand for our faith.
The Gospel according to St. Matthew
Author :
St. Matthew, the apostle
Symbol : Man
Because he begins his gospel
with the genealogy of Jesus.
Time and place : 80-90 AD Syria Palestine.
Other names, used for this gospel: the Gospel of the kingdom of God and Gospel
of the Church.
The purpose of writing the gospel: Jesus is the New Moses and New Messianic
Teacher.
The father of Apostle Matthew was Alphaus. Matthew was a tax collector before he
was called by Christ. He showed that just as Moses was the law giver in the Old
Testament, Jesus Christ was the new law giver in the New Testament. We too must
learn the values of the kingdom such as love, justice, peace, forgiveness and try to
build up a society where there are such values.
The Gospel of according to St. Luke
Author St. Luke
Symbol Cow
St. Luke begin his Gospel with
an incident when a priest, name
Zechariah was getting ready to
offer sacrifices. Those days bulls
were sacrificed.
Time and place : 80-85 AD Antioch in Syria
Other names used for this gospel : gospel of the poor, gospel of gentiles, gospel
of mercy, gospel of women.
Purpose of writing the gospel : To prove that Jesus is the saviour not only of the
Jews but of the whole human race.
This gentile historian tries to prove that Jesus Christ is the savior of the whole
universe. He was a physician and an artist. He was a writer who made a great
emphasis on the love and compassion of Jesus towards women, the poor,
fisherfolk, the marginalized and widows. Besides the gospel, he wrote the Acts of
the Apostles. The Acts of the apostles is considered as the second part of the gospel.
St. Luke says in his gospel that Jesus had great sympathy towards the helpless and
the despaired. Therefore we too must have sympathy towards the helpless and the
needy and help them as much as we can.
The Gospel according to St. John
Author : St. John, the apostle
Symbol : Eagle
It has very deep theological
concepts. The eagle is a bird who
flies high in the sky.
Time and place : 90-100 AD Ephesus
Other names used for the gospel : Spiritual Gospel
The purpose of writing gospel : to prove that Jesus is the son of God and by
believing in him that you may have Eternal life.
John and his brother, James (the Great) were the first apostles chosen by Jesus.
They were fishermen and their parents were Zebedee and Salomi. St. John wrote
his gospel in a different style than the others three evangelists. St. John wants
to prove that Jesus Christ is the son of God and by believing in him you may
have Eternal Life. St. John had tried to prove Jesus' divinity more than others
elaborating on his teaching and miracles. We too must try to believe in Jesus and
attain Eternal Life.
By living according to the messages found in the four gospels, we can attain Eternal
Life. We who study goodnews should be a goodnews to others sothat they too can
be happy and attain Eternal Life.

Creation
Rebecca : Mama, in my rose bush a beautiful flower has bloomed.
Mama : See, our whole garden is full of flowers, songs of birds and beautiful
butterflies of various colours. What a beautiful day is it?
Rebecca: Brother, how did this beautiful universe came into being? Who made this
wonderful systematic order?
Roy :
There are various theories about the origin of the universe.
Rebecca: What are they?
Roy :
Expansion theory, Big Bang theory and Pierre-Simon Laplace theory.
Naomi : Brother, are these theories true?
Roy :
They have not yet been proved scientifically. They may be either true or
false.
Naomi :
If they are proved to be true, will the creation story be false?
Roy :
Not at all
Naomi : Why is it?
Roy :
Then they tell us how God created the world. The Holy Bible says that
God is the creator of the world, yet it does not say how God created the
world. God has given intelligence to man to find out how God created
these things. Science helps us to know how of the things.
Picture 5.1 - The Environment
Pre History (Genes 1-11)
In the book of Genesis chapters one to eleven are considered as pre history. Pre
History means before history. It is difficult to investigate or study things that have
taken place before history. The biblical author presents the pre history in parables
and fables which speak about the beginning of the universe and man. In doing so
he hopes to give only a theological message. He does not expect to teach how the
universe and the man came into being. Hence from the pre historic parables and
fables we can learn theological messages but not scientific or historical truths. The
main message of those stories is that God is the creator of the world.
In the Book of Genesis there are two creation stories.
1. The first creation story (Genesis 1:1 -2:4a)
2. The second creation story (Genesis 2:4b-25)
The First Creation Story
This story belongs to Priestly Tradition. In a liturgical setting creation of the world
is limited to seven days. Here the author is trying to emphasize the importance of
Sabbath day. God created the world in six days and rested on the Sabbath day. In the
same way we too must spend the 7th day (Sunday) holy for God. God created man
into His image and likeness. God did not create any other creature in His image and
likeness. Therefore man is superior to all the other creatures.
For three reasons man is superior to all other creatures
1. Intelligence
2. Free well
3. Immortal soul
If man is superior to all other creatures he should use his intelligence and free will
to do good always. Then he who has an immortal soul can enter into an immortal
life.
The Second Creation Story
This story belongs to Yahwistic tradition. Man is the greatest creation on the
earth because God has given the breath of life only to man. This shows the close
relationship that man has with God.
Woman is created from the rib that the Lord God has taken from the man.
By creating woman from the rib, closer to heart shows that the woman and man
are equal. She is neither a slave nor a boss. The relationship between man and
woman is based on love. Woman is a part of man. Therefore a man is incomplete
without a woman and a woman is incomplete without a man. Husband and wife
should live their married life with love, respect and understanding. Human beings
are the greatest of all God's creations. Therefore man and woman should respect
each other's differences.
Activity
1. Write one characteristic that shows man is the supreme creature
according to the first creation story.
2. Write the three reasons that shows the above characteristic.
3. Write one characteristic that shows man is the supreme creature

Fall of man into sin
Picture 6.1 - sweets and meat
Look at the various kinds of food in this picture. Try to recognize them, cake,
ice-cream, chocolate and various kinds of meat. How tasty and nutritious are they?
but cake, ice-cream and other sweet things are not good for a diabetic patient.
Likewise beaf, pork and sausages are bad for heart patients. If they eat these food
they become more sick and they may die soon.
We and those sick people have an appetite to eat them. It is alright to have an
appetite. An appetite is neither good nor bad. It is the decision, based on appetite
that becomes good or bad.
The serpent in the Book of Genesis chapter three is a symbol of man's appetite and
it shows how the serpant increases the appetite (Genesis 3:1-6).
Serpent ¡ Did God say, you shall not eat of any tree of the garden?
Woman ¡ We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but God said you shall
not eat of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, neither
shall you touch it, lest you die.
Serpent ¡ You will not die. For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will
be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.
When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and
it was a delight to the eyes and that the tree was to be
desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate and
she also gave some to her husband, and he ate.
(Genesis 3:6)
The above scripture quotation shows how appetite speaks to her:
The tree was good (Genesis 3:6)
The fruit was a delight (Genesis 3:6)
The fruit makes one wise (Genesis 3:6)
Before she ate the fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, she had already
forecast that fruit was delicious and that it was a means of wisdom. She made a
wrong decision based on appetite. We can have a number of messages from this.
³ We should not make wrong decisions, based on appetite.
³ When we make decisions we must listen to our conscience.
³ We have to listen to God's will in our free choice.
God is a loving father. Therefore God advises His children sothat they may walk on
the right path. The advice given to Adam and Eve is such an example.
But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat,
for in the day that you eat of it you shall die.
(Genesis 2:17)
Another example is the advice, given to Cain.
The Lord said to Cain; Why are you angry, why has your countenance
fallen? If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do
well, sin is couching at the door; its desire is for you, but you must
master it.
(Genesis 4:6-7)
Adam and Eve gave into their appetite and ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge of
good and evil. Cain, full of jealousy and envy towards his brother Abel, killed him.
God questioned Adam, Eve and Cain who had gone against his advice and sinned
against him.
Adam and Eve (Genesis 3:11-19)
Cain (Genesis 4:9)
² Questioning Adam
² Questioning Cain
Where is your Abel?
Cain: I do not know, am I my
brother's keeper?
Who told you that you were naked?
Have you eaten of the tree of which I
commanded you not to eat?
Adam : The woman whom thou
gavest to be with me, she gave me
fruit of the tree, and I ate.
² Questioning Woman
What is this that you have done?
Woman: The serpent beguilled me
and I ate.
God punished the man who has gone astray.
Genesis
² I will greatly multiply your pain in childbearing;
² In pain you shall bring forth children.
² Yet your desire shall be for your husband, and he
shall rule over you.
² Cursed is the ground. In toil you shall eat of it all
the days of your life
² Thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you,
² In sweat of your face, you shall eat bread till you
return to the ground, for out of it you were take
² you are dust, and to dust you shall return.
Genesis
3:17-19
Genesis
4(11:12)
² you are cursed from the ground .
² You shall be banned from the soil
² when you till the ground, it shall no longer
yield to you its strength
² you shall be a wanderer on the earth
God did not punish our firstparents with anger but with love. as parents who
punish their children when they do wrong. Though the parents punish us they
love us; and forgive us. God's love and mercy towards us are shown through the
promises, laid down below.
I will put enmity between you and the woman, and
between your offspring and hers; and he will bruise
your head, and you will bruise his heel.
(Genesis 3:15)
Through this promise God, gave a hope to Adam and Eve about salvation. God
promises them to send a Saviour.
The Lord God made for Adam and for his wife garments
of skins and clothed them.
(Genesis 3:21)
They were wearing fig leaves; God made them garments out of skins. This shows
God's merey and love for them. Even for those who have sinned against God, his
protection and attention is always there. God had mercy on Cain too.
Then the Lord said to Cain, Not so! If any slays
Cain, vengence shall be taken on him sevenfold.
(Genesis 4:15)
We must obey and respet all those who give us good advice and show us the
correct path. This remind us that even a life of a sinner is belong to God. We have
to obey;
³ our conscience
³ our parents and elders
³ our teachers and
³ our religious leaders
From the time of our first parents the sin in the world increased. The Lord saw that
the wickedness of man had increased to its zenith. The author of the Bible says:
The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth,
and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only
evil continually. And the Lord was sorry that he had made man
on the earth, and he grieved him to his heart. So the Lord said,
“I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the
ground, man and beast and creaping things and birds of the air. I
will bring a flood of waters.
(Genesis 6:5-7, 6:17)
Sin increased on the earth. Hence God decided to blot out human beings from this
earth. The author of the Bible wants to say not that God wanted to destroy mankind
by a flood but to remove sin from this earth. He brought about a flood and thereby
to have a beginning of a new earth. Noah is the beginner of the new creation. He
was chosen because;
1. Noah was a righteous man
2. Blameless in his generation
3. Noah walked with God.
(Genesis 6:9)
Noah's righteousness spared his family from a great disaster and your righteousness
counts for the salvation of
² yourself
² your family
² your country

When God called Abraham, He gave him a promise: “I will make of you a great
nation” (Genesis 12:2). He fulfilled that promise and let his family grew into a great
nation. That great nation was in Egypt.
Joseph was already in Egypt. Then Joseph died, and all
his brothers and all that generation. But the descendants of
Israel were fruitful and increased greatly; they multiplied
and grew exceedingly strong, so that the land was filled
with them.
(Exodus 1:5-6)
Abraham's generation grew and multiplied in Egypt with the assistance of the
Egyptian kings, but later, the situation changed:
There arose a new king over Egypt, who did not
know Joseph
(Exodus 1:8)
The king who did not know anything about Joseph meant that he did not know any
thing about the great services that Josehp had rendered to Egypt. Therefore the new
king of Egypt wanted to control the increase of the Israelites. For that he followed three
steps:
1. Forced labour
He set taskmasters over them to oppress them with forced labour. They built
store cities, Pithom and Rameses. They made their lives bitter with hard service
in mortar and brick, and all kinds of work in the field labour (Exodus 1:11-14).
2. Killing of male children at birth
The king ordered the midwives to kill male children at birth (Exodus 1:16)
3. Every boy that is born to the Hebrews shall be thrown into the River Nile
(Exodus 1:22).
When she (mother of Moses) saw that he was a goodly
child she hid him three months. And when she could hide
him no longer she took for him a basket made of bulrushes
and daubed it with bitumen and pitch; and she put the child
in it and placed it among the reeds at the river's bank. Then
the king's daughter came to bathe in the river. She saw the
basket among the reeds and asked a maid to bring it. When
she opened it she saw the child, and she took pity on him. She
took him as her son. She named him Moses.
(Exodus 2:1-10)
God who paved the way for Moses to go to the king's palace helped him to grow
up like a prince with all the royal comforts. He learnt all the skills and received
a training to be a good leader. God, who prepared him, appeared to Moses in the
burning brush and revealed himself.
God said, “I am the God of your father, the
God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the
God of Jacob.”
(Exodus 3:6)
Picture 7.1 - God calls Moses
God called Moses to free the Israelites from the bondage of slavery and lead them
to the promised land.
I have come down to deliver them out of that
land and to bring them into a land flowing with
milk and honey.
(Exodus 3:8)
Moses accepted God's invitation though it was full of obstacles and struggles.
He went to king Pharaoh, and told him that God wants him to free the Israelites
from the slavery of Egypt. King Pharaoh ignored his request. Moses was not
discouraged he always remembered the encouraging words of God:
I will be with you.
(Exodus 3:12)
Pharaoh's heart was hardened and he would not listened to Moses and he would
not accept God's almighty power. Therefore God sent ten plagues to the people of
Egypt.
Ten Plagues
Water

Frogs
Gnats

Death of the firstborn
Gradually the plagues increased until the death of the firstborn. The reason for this
is in the quotation below.
The Lord said to Moses, “Pharaoh will not listen to
you, in order that my wonders may be multiplied in the
land of Egypt”.
(Exodus 11:9)
After the death of the firstborn of Egypt, king Pharaoh gave permission to the
Israelites to leave Egypt. When king Pharaoh was told that the Israelites have left
Egypt, he and his official said “What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go
from serving us?” Egyptians persued the Isralites and got drowned in the sea. God is
the master and the creator of the whole universe. Good God makes use of the nature
to show his love and protection to His people.

God chose Moses to free the Israelites from the bondage of Egypt and bring them
back to the promised land. In the same way, through the sacrament of baptism, God
has entrusted to the church to save the children of God from all kinds of slavery, and
to take them to the heavenly promised land, kingdom of God.
We have received the Baptism and have become the children of God. Therefore we
have the responsibility of helping others to free themselves from the bondage of
sin and pave the way for them to go to the promised land which is the kingdom of
heaven.
In our journey of life, God who gave divine protection to the Israelites in the
wilderness, will protect us too in our difficulties and struggles. We should have a
deep faith in God through out our life. St. James in his letter says about actions
of faith.
What does it profit, my brethren, if a man says he has
faith, but has not have works? Can faith save him? So
faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead.
(James 2:14-17)

The Covenant of Sinai
Picture 8.1 - Moses with the Ten commandments
A covenant is a solemn agreement between two parties over something with
conditions laid down. There are various kinds of agreements, namely poltical
agreements, economic agreements peace agreements, marriage agreements, etc.
There are covenants in the Holy Bible. They are different from the agreements in
the society. Here are some differences.
³ It is God who initiates the covenant.
³ There is a vast difference between God and man.
³ Though God is always faithful to all those agreements, man breaks them.
Here are some examples for such covenants.
(1) God made a covenant with our first parents
I will put enmity between you and the woman, and
between your seed and her seed. He shall bruise
your head, and you shall bruise his heel.
(Genesis 3:15)
God had to make a covenat with our first parents because they went against his words
and lost the relationship that they had with God. To reestablish that relationship
God promised to send a redeemer. The promise that God made to our first parents
was fulfilled in Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ crushed the head of the serpent.
(2) The covenant that God made with Noah
After the sin of disobedience of our first parents, sin increased in the world.
Therefore God wanted to eliminate all the sins from this world. Therefore God
sent a great flood and all the sinful people got drowned. Afterwards God made a
covenant with Noah that he will not destroy the earth with a flood.
I establish my covenant with you, and your
descendants after you and with every living
creature ............ that never again shall all
flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood, and
never again shall there be a flood to destroy
the earth.
(Genesis 9:11)
The rainbow is the external sign of this covenant.
I have set my bow in the cloud, and it shall
be a sign of the covenant between me and
the earth.
(Genesis 9:13)
(3) The covenant made with Abraham
God made a covenant with Abraham too. That covenant is from two traditions.
Genesis 15:1-24 (J Tradition)
Genesis 17:1-14 (P Tradition)
1. “He brought him outside and said
'Look toward heaven and number
the stars, if you are able to number
them so shall your descendants
(Genesis 15:5)
2. To your descendants I give this
(Genesis 15:18)
1. “I will make you exceedingly
fruitful; and I will make nations
of you, and kings shall come forth
from you”.
(Genesis 17:6)
2. “I will give to you and your
descendents after you, the land
of your sojourning and a the land
of canaan, for an everlasting
possession. And I will be their
God”.
(Genesis 17:8)
There are two main points in this covenant
1. A great generation out of Abraham
2. A land that will be his forever
The visible sign of the covenant with Abraham was circumcision
This is my covenant, which you shall
keep. Every male among you shall be
circumcised.
(Genesis 17:10)
By fulfilling this external sign, the Israelites entered into a covenant relationship
with God.
^4) Sinai Covenant
The Israelites, who led a nomadic life became the people of God after the Sinai
covenant. God gave them the Ten commandments as a set of rules to be kept. Ten
commandments are a sign of God's love. The ten commandments are a guide for us.
It shows how to have our relationship with God and our neighbour. This covenant
brings us closer to God and our neighbour.
Exodus 20:1-17
Our duties towards God

1. I am the Lord your God.
You shall have no other

2. You shall not take the

9. You shall not covet your

10.You shall not covet your

Ten commandments are a set of rules for all times. All generations have followed
these rules and have built up a good relationship with God. We too must live according
to the ten commandment and become worthy people to enter into heaven.
As the Israelites became people of God through the Sinai covenant, we too have
become children of God through the sacrament of Baptism. We too have made a
covenant with God through Baptism.

St. John the Baptist
Old Testament
I send my
Behold,
messager to prepare the
way before me.
(Malachi 3:1)
New Testament
He will turn many of the
sons of Israel to the Lord
their God.
(Luke 1:16)
Picture 9.1 - St. John the Baptist
As it is mentioned in the Old Testament, St. John the Baptist's responsibility was
to go before the Lord Jesus Christ and prepare the way for Him and the people
to accept His message. The birth of John the Baptist was informed to his father
Zechariah by an angel.
According to the custom of the priesthood, it fell on to him by
lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense. And there
appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of
altar of incense. And Zechariah was troubled when he saw him and
fear fell upon him. But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid,
Zechariah, for your prayer is heard, and your wife Elizabeth will
bear you a son”.
(Luke 1:9-13)
Zechariah, who could not believe this divine message, questioned the Angel:
How shall I know this? For I am an old man and
my wife is advanced in years
(Luke 1:18)
Since Zechariah did not believe God's message, he had to undergo a punishment.
And behold, you will be silent and unable to speak
untill the day that these things come to pass, because
you did not believe my words.
(Luke 1:20)
The child who was to be born of Zechariah and Elizabeth was none other than John
the Baptist who was to prepare the way to Jesus Christ. Thus it is clear that nothing
is impossible for God. It is also proved by the words that the Angel Gabriel told
Mother Mary:
And behold, your kinswoman Elizabeth in her
old age has also conceived a son; and this is the
sixth month with her who was called barren. For
with God nothing will be impossible.
(Luke 1:36)
When the angel informed Zechariah about the birth of John the Baptist, the angel
told him some important things about him.
For he will be great before the Lord and he shall
drink no wine or strong drink and he will be filled
with the Holy spirit even from his mother's womb.
(Luke 1:15)
Mary, who was filled with fraternal love, went to visit her cousin Elizabeth and
greeted her.
When Elizabeth heard greeting of Mary the
babe leaped in her womb.
(Luke 1:41)
It is the teaching of the Church that at this moment St. John the Baptist was freed
from the original sin.
According to the Jewish customs, the child was circumcised on the eighth day after
his birth. As they were preparing to give him a name, Zechariah gave his name:
He asked for a writing tablet and wrote, “His name
is John.” And they all marvelled. And immediately
his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he
spoke, blessing God.
(Luke 1:63)
By a special kind of birth John the Baptist received a special calling by God. His
mission was to prepare the way for the Messiah, the one who was to come. He
began his mission around River Jordan.
He went in to all the region about
the Jordan, preaching a baptism of
repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
(Luke 3:3)
Starting his ministry, he challenged the people of Israel.
You brood of vipers. Who warned you to flee
from the wrath to come? Bear fruits that befit
repentance, and do not begin to say to yourselves.
''We have Abraham as our father for I tell you:
God is able from these stones to raise up children
to Abraham.''
(Luke 3:7-8)
By this saying it shows that one cannot gain salvation only by belonging to Abraham's
generation. Repentance is necessary and true personal conversion is very necessary.
In the same way only by receiving baptism one cannot attain salvation. We have to
have repentance for our sins, real conversion of heart and lead a good and holy life.
The response of the people who listened to John the Baptist was, “what then shall
we do?” (Luke 3.10). John the Baptist gave advice to ordinary people, tax collectors
and soldiers who came to him. The advice that he gave is fitting not only for present
but also future generations. By his advice he expected a change of attitudes. It is an
invitation for us to have a change of our lifestyles.
To the ordinary
people
Luke 3:11
Tax collectors
Luke 3:13
³ He who has two coats,
let him share with him
who has none.
³ He who has food, let
him do likewise.
³ Collect no more than
is appointed you.
Soldiers
Luke 3:14
³ Rob no one by violence
or by false accusations.
³ Be content with your
wages.
³ We are invited to share
with others even things
necessary for us.
³ We are invited to do our
work with fairness and
justice.
³ To do our duties well
for the welfare of the
citizens of our country.
³ We are invited to do
our job in accordance
the salary we
get, and work
the betterment of the
country with love and
justice.
The new social doctrine that St. John the Baptist laid down included good virtues
such as justice, communion, solidarity and love.
Just as St. John the Baptist prepared the way for the first coming of Jesus Christ,
the Holy Catholic Church and each and everyone of us have the responsibility of
preparing the people for his second coming.
Holy Mother Church in her liturgical year has set aside two seasons, namely
Advent and Lent as periods of repentance. Not only during these two periods
but also everyday and every moment we should prepare ourselves for the second
coming of Jesus Christ.
Death of St. John the Baptist (Matthew 14:1-12)
When Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias
danced before the company and pleased Herod so that
he promised with an oath to give her whatever she
might ask. Prompted by her mother, she said, “Give me
the head of John the Baptist here on a platter. And the
king was sorry but because of his oath and his guests,
he commanded it to be given; he sent and had John
beheaded in the prison.”
(Matthew 14:6-10)
The main reason for his death was that John the Baptist spoke boldly about Herod's
wrong behavior. Herod kept his brother's wife as his own.
For Herod has seized John and bound him and put
him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother
Philip's wife, because John said to him. “it is not
lawful for you to have her.” And though he wanted
to put him to death, he feared the people, because
they held him to be a prophet.
(Matthew 14:3-4)
Since John the Baptist spoke bravely about injustice and lawlessness, he was put
to death.
In his prophetic mission he spoke bravely about injustice in the society and he had
to pay for it with his life. In the same way all those who speak against injustice will
have to face the same fate. E.g.Rev. Fr. Michael Rodrigo.
You who have received the sacrament of Baptism is a prophet or a prophetess. Are
you ready to stand up for justice and truth? When you try to stand today for those
things you might have to lose many things. Even if you have lost many things you
cannot by pass them. That is the duty of a Catholic today.
Activity
1. Explain three things that you can do to fulfill the message that
John the Baptist gave to the ordinary people.
2. Give an example when you testified to your prophetic mission.

The Mission of Jesus Christ
Picture 10.1 - Baptism of Jesus
Jesus' public life and his ministry started with his baptism. When he was being
baptized by John the Baptist, the Holy Trinity manifested. Jesus was proclaimed
as the Son of God.
Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus also had
been baptized and was praying, the heaven was opened and the
Holy Spirit descended upon him in bodily form as a dove and a
voice came from heaven, “Thou art my beloved son; with thee I
am well pleased.”
(Luke 3:21-22)
After this experience at the River Jordan, Lord Jesus Christ went into the wilderness
to have a deep union with His Father:
Jesus full of the Holy Spirit returned from the Jordan and was
led by the Spirit for forty days in the wilderness, tempted by
the devil. And he ate nothing in those days; and when they
were ended, he was hungry.
(Luke 4:1-2)
Incarnated Jesus had to face three temptations at the beginning of his ministry.
temptation
Luke 4:3-4
The temptation
The devil said to
him, “if you are
the Son of God,
command this stone
to become bread”
The response of
Jesus
“Man shall not live
by bread alone”
Its message
One should use one's own
power and capabilities
for the common good and
should not use them for
one's selfish gains.
life nourished by
the word of God is much
more valuable than the
life nourished by food.
You shall worship
the Lord your God,
and him only shall
you serve.
What belongs
to God
should not be given to
power and wealth.
It is said You shall
not tempt the Lord
your God.
We must not work for our
personal glory.
temptation
Luke 4:7-8
temptation
Luke 4:9-
Then the devil took
him to a mountain
showed him
kingdoms of
earth and said, “If
you, then, worship
me (satan), it shall
all be yours”
Then the devil took
him to Jeruselem,
and set him on the
pinnacle
temple, and said to
him, “if you are the
Son of God, throw
yourself down from
here for it is written.
He will command
his angels to protect
you.”
Having overcome these three temptations, he came to Nazareth where he had been
brought up He went to the synagogue on Sabbath day, as his custom was. And he
stood up to read, and there was given to him the book of the prophet Isaiah.
The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has
anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He
has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and
recoverying of sight to the blind to set at liberty those
who are oppressed, to proclaim the acceptable year
of the Lord.
(Luke 4:18-19)
As it is mentioned in the above scripture passage, the aim of the mission of Jesus
was the welfare of the poor, the slaves, the oppressed and the blind.
Miracles
According to St. Augustine, a miracle is an act contrary to the laws of nature. For
example, in the nature water never turns into wine, but Jesus turned water into
wine. By performing miracles, Jesus proved that the kingdom of God had come, We
can categorise the miracles of Jesus Christ into four groups.
1 Healings
The man with a withered hand (Matthew 12:9-14)
2 Exorcisms
The healing of Gerasene Demonic (Mark 5:1-20)
3 Nature Miracles
Walking on the sea (Matthew 14:22-31)
4 Raising the Dead
Raising of Lazarus (John 11:38-44)
Through
miracles of Jesus
Christ
Picture 10.2 - Examples of four categories of
miracles performed by Lord Jesus
They show the abounding love of God for man
God reveals himself to man
The glory and power of God are revealed
They prove that Jesus is the son of God
They testify to the ministry of Jesus Christ
They are signs of messianic kingdom
Jesus, who proved that the kingdom of God has come through miracles, bore witness
through his words too. It is clear from the following passage of scripture.
But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out demons, then
the kingdom of God has come upon you.
(Luke 11:20)
Deep faith in the power God is a necessity for performing miracles.
1. Jesus said to the blind man at Jericho
“Receive your sight. Your faith has made you well” (Luke 18:42).
2. To the woman who touched the fringe of his cloak.
“Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well.” (Matthew 9:22).
You can experience miracles if you have a deep faith in God, when you face
problems, challenges, sicknesses and pain in your life. To the extent your experience
you faith deepens.
Mission of the seventy (Luke 10:1-12)
Only St. Luke mentions the mission of the 70. Bible scholars say that it was the
belief that there were seventy nations at that time in the world. St. Luke says that the
Lord appointed another seventy to send them ahead of him; Jesus wants every nation
to hear the message of the goodnews. The mission of the seventy is symbolic. That
the goodnews have to be preached to all those who do not know the goodnews.
Jesus chose a group to establish his kingdom in the hearts of people. He explained
to this group of disciples the urgency of this apostolate and the trials and challenges
they have to face in performing this service. He advised them to carry no bag, no
purse, no sandals and to have faith in divine providence.
The harvest is plentiful but the labourers are few; pray
therefore the Lord of the harvest to send out labourers into
his harvest. Go your way behold, I send you out as lambs
in the midst of wolves. Carry no purse, no bag, no sandals;
and salute no one on the road. Whatever house you enter,
first say “Peace be to this house;” and say to them the
kingdom of God has come to this house.”
(Luke 10:1-9)
Holy Mother Church has the responsibility of evangelization of the world till the
end of time. We, who have become the children of holy Mother Church through
baptism, have the same responsibility of spreading the goodnews wherever we are.
First we must establish the Christian values within ourslaves and then give them to
the society where we live in.
Through evangelization and catechism we can bring the goodnews to the world. By
leading exemplary lives we can preach the goodnews to others. The best place for
this is the lay apostolates in our own parish.
Let us join these various societies in the parish and take the mission of Jesus forward.
Activity
1. Write an incident that you experienced Jesus in your life of faith.
2. Write five ways that you can fulfil your responsibility of preaching
the goodnews to others as a Catholic student.
3. Write three things that you have to do to experience miracles in
your life.
4. Write a miracle that you experienced in your life recently.
For your life
³ Let us experience the living Lord in our life
of faith
³ Our responsibility is to do missionary work
like Jesus. Let us be charitable towards the
poor and the weak.
Kingdom of God
Picture 11.1 - Where there is love, there is God
A kingdom has its limits. It has rules and a constitution. It has people, governed
by a government. Kingdom of God is not a worldly kingdom. It has no limits. Then
where is the kingdom of God?
Is it above the sky?
Is it down on the earth?
Is it within you?
Is it within me?
Or has it not yet come?
The Kingdom of God is
Kingdom of God is surrendering oneself
to the will of God and being fully under
his control.
To live in heaven is “to be with Christ.” The elect live “in Christ,”
but they retain, or rather find, their true identity, their own name.
According to St. Ambrose, for life is to be with Christ, where Christ
is, there is life, there is the kingdom.
(C.C.C. 1025)
Lord Jesus Christ taught the values of the kingdom through parables.
Examples: -
Parable of the Sower (Matthew 13:1-23)
Parable of the weeds among the wheat (Matthew 13:24-30)
• Parable of the Mustard Seed (Matthew 13:31-43)
Parables of Treasure, Yeast, Pearl and Net thrown into the sea
(Matthew 13: 44-53)
Parable of the sower

He who hears the word and
accepts it with joy, endures
it only for a while and when
troubles come on account of
the word he immediately falls
away.
One hears the word, but the
cares of the world and delight
of riches choke the word and it
yields nothing
This is the one who hears the
word and understands it bears

Lord Jesus Christ thr ough Sermons taught the people about the Kingdom of
Being asked by the pharisees when the kingdom of God was
coming, he answered them, The kingdom of God is not coming
with signs to be observed; nor will they say “Look here it is! or
There! For behold the kingdom of God is in the midst you”
(Luke 17:20-25)
Therefore, we need not run here and there looking for the kingdom of God. Kingdom
of God is within us. It is among us. We desire to find the kingdom of God wherever
we are. To fulfill that desire we must read the sermon on the mount and try to
understand its teachings and live according to those teachings of Jesus.
The kingdom values according to the sermon on the mount.
Picture 11.3 - The Sermon on the Mount
We find the sermon on the mount in Matthew chapters 5, 6, and 7.
Here are the some of the teachings
• The beatitudes (Matthew 5:1-12)
• Salt and Light (Matthew 5:13-16)
• Teaching about Retaliation (Matthew 5:38-42)
• Love for Enemies (Matthew 5:43-48)
• Teaching abouth Almsgiving (Matthew 6:1-4)
• Teaching about Fasting (Matthew 6:16-18)
• Treasure in Heaven (Matthew 6:19-21)
• Dependence on God (Matthew 6:25-34)
• The Golden Rule (Matthew 7:12)
• The Narrow Gate (Matthew 7:13-14)
• The True Disciple (Matthew 7:21-23)
• The Two Foundations (Matthew 7:24-29)
Values of
the kingdom
according to
beatitudes
1. Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the
kingdom of heaven
2. Blessed are those who mourn, for they
shall be comforted
3. Blessed are the meek, for they shall
inherit the earth
4. Blessed are those who hunger and
thirst for righteousness, for they
shall be filled
5. Blessed are the merciful, for
they shall obtain mercy.
6. Blessed are the pure in heart, for
they shall see God.
7. Blessed are the peace makers, for they
shall be called children of God
8. Blessed are those who are persecuted
for righteousness, sake for theirs is the
kingdom of heaven
Lord Jesus Christ by preaching the eight beatitudes in the Sermon on the Mount

Baptism and Confirmation
Baptism
Picture 12.1 - Baptism of Jesus and Baptism of an infant
The words that Jesus said to Nicodemus verifies that we should receive baptism to
enter the kingdom of God.
Unless one is born of water and the spirit,
he cannot enter the kingdom of God.
(John 3:5)
Before ascension Jesus commanded his apostles to make disciples from all nations
and baptize them.
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them
in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you, and
behold I am with you always to the end of the age.
(Matthew 28:19-20)

(Pope St. Leo the Great)

Holy Communion)
³ Should have completed the age of 16
³ Should live a life of faith and understand the duties, assigned to the role
³ Should be free from any kind of punishment, declared by the Catholic Church
³ Should be a person appointed by the child's parents

³ Should not be child's parents.
Symbolic things used at the Baptism and their meanings
Water :
Water is the main and essential symbolic thing at the Baptism.
As water was used at creation of the world, it gives a new life
at Baptism. In the begining of the world, the Spirit of God was
moving over the waters (Genesis 1:2). Holy spirit descended upon
Jesus, when He was baptized. (Mark 1:10)
White Garment : White is the symbol of purity. Laying the white garment on the
child or dressing it to the child symbolizes the spiritual cleanliness
of the child. Man lived a life of grace before he fell into sin and
after the fall, he lost that life of grace. The white garment of
baptism symbolizes that the baptised will be lifted up to a graceful
life. It also symbolizes the garment of the Risen Lord. It reminds
us that we are participating in the glory of the Risen Lord.
Anointing with Sacred Chrism: “Chrism”, the perfumed oil, consecrated in
the name of Jesus Christ, is used to anoint the neophyte at the
baptism. The anointing symbolizes the strengthening. Christians
are strengthened:
³ to live according to their faith
³ to fight against the things which challenges the faith.
The person is anointed as a priest, prophet and king to serve God
and man.
Lighted Paschal Candle : Lighted Paschal Candle is a symbol of the Risen Lord.
A small candle is lighted from the paschal candle at the baptismal
rite. It symbolizes that the Risen Christ lights the soul of the
neophyte. It entails that a follower of Christ does not walk in the
dark but should always walk in the path of light.
Confirmation
Picture 12.2 - Bishop is giving the sacrament of confirmation
Confirmation in the Salvation History
We cannot separate Holy Spirit from the life of Jesus. He was conceived by the
power of the Holy spirit.
Joseph son of David, do not fear to take Mary your
wife, for that which conceived in her is of the Holy
Spirit,
(Matthew 1:20)
The Angel said to Mary.
The Holy spirit will come upon you, and the power of the
Most High will overshadow you. Therefore the child to
be born will be called holy, the Son of God.
(Luke 1:35)
When Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist at the river Jordan, Holy Spirit came
upon him as a dove. At the begining of his public ministry, Jesus proclaimed:
The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to
preach good news to the poor.
(Luke 4:18)
Jesus also explained to his apostles, how they will act when they receive the Holy
Spirit.
You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come
upon you, and you shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem,
and in all Judea and Sameria and to the end of the earth.
(Acts 1:8)

The Sacraments of Healing
There are two Sacraments of Healing
1. The Sacrament of Reconciliation
2. The Sacrament of the sick anointing
These two sacraments are named as sacraments of Healing, because they give
physical and spiritual healing to the person. Physical and spiritual healing are for
the benefit of the eternal life.
The Sacrament of Reconciliation
Picture 13.1 - Receiving the Sacrament of Reconciliation
The other names for this sacrament.
1. The Sacrament of Conversion
This name is used because, one has to accept one's sinfulnes and return to God to
receive forgiveness.
2. The Sacrament of Penance
This sacrament is named as the sacrament of penance because it incudes
conversion, penance and satisfaction.
3. The Sacrament of Confession
It is called the sacrament of confession because each one has to confess his/her
sins and receive forgiveness from God.
4. The Sacrament of Forgiveness
The main result of this sacrament is forgiveness. Through this sacrament God
grants peace of mind to the penitant.
Inner repentance
Interior repentance is a radical reorientation of our whole life, a return, a
conversion towards God with all our heart. It is an end of sin, turning away from
evil, with repugnance towards the evil actions that we have committed. Because of
that without an interior conversion, such penances remain sterile and false, “The
sacrifice acceptable to God is a broken spirit; a broken, contrite and humble heart”
(Ps 51:17).
The Acts of the penitant
Contrition is sorrow for sin and detestation for the sin committed, together with the
resolution not to sin again.
Two types of contrition
perfect imperfect
Contrition is called “perfect” when it arises from love by which is God is loved
above all else. It is also called as ‘contrition of charity.' Such contrition remits venial
sins. It also obtains forgiveness of mortal sins, if it includes the firm resolution to
have recourse to the sacrament of confession as soon as possible.
The contrition called “imperfect” is also a gift of God, a prompting of the Holy
Spirt. It is born of the consideration of sin's ugliness or the fear of eternal damnation
and the other penalties threatening the sinner (contrition of fear). It is an imperfect
contrition, which cannot obtain the forgiveness of grave sins, but it requires one to
obtain forgiveness in the sacrament of penance.
Among acts of penitent, contrition occupies first place.
In order to make a good confession, the penitant should follow the steps, given
below.
1. Examination of conscience
2. Be sorry for the sins committed (Perfect contrition is recommend more than
the imperfect contrition)
3. Make a firm desire, not to sin again
4. Confession of sins to a priest i.e receive the sacrament of Reconciliation
5. Do works of penance and reparation.
One who receives the sacrament of Reconciliation with true contrition and
conversion is 'rending heart but not the garment. ‘Rending Heart’ is correcting the
wrong, done. e.g:- giving back the things stolen, paying the damage done, helping
the poor and needy. The following things are very important for this.
Methods of Penance (Penitential Acts)
³ Prayer
³ Fasting
³ Alms giving
³ Bearing sufferings and disappointments patiently
³ Even though we are tired, we have to fulfill our task, what was assigned with
The effects of the Sacrament of Reconcilliation
The whole power of this sacrament of penance consists in restoring us to God's
grace and joining us with him in an intimate friendship. Reconciliation with God
is the purpose and effect of this sacrament. For those who receive the sacrament
of penance with contrite heart and religious disposition, “reconciliation is usually
followed by peace and serenity of conscience with strong spiritual consolation”.
Through the Sacrament of Reconciliation
³ Brings about spiritual resurrection
³ Restoration of the dignity of the children of God
³ Blessing of the life of children of God
³ The most important thing out of all these is the friendship with God
Rebuilds the broken
relationship
Gives forgiveness of sins
Gives inner peace
Gives strength to make a firm
decision , not to sin again
Through the
Sacrament of
Reconcilliation
From the Holy Scripture
I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one
sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous
persons who need no repentance.
(Luke 15:7)
The Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter
remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said
to him “Before the cock crows today; you will deny
me three times.” And he went out and wept bitterly.”
(Luke 22:61-62)
The Sacrament of Anointing of the Sick
Picture 13.2 - Anointing a sick person
Healing the sick was given an important place in Jesus' ministry. Healing the paralytic
man (Matthew 9:2-7) and healing the man with a withered hand (Matthew 12:10-
13) are some examples for that. The faith of the sick person was most important
thing needed for the healing. Because of that, to the woman who touched the
garment, Jesus said:
Daughter your faith has made you well.
(Mark 5:34)
When Jesus sent out his apostles for the mission, they too healed the sick by
anointing with oil.
They cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many who
were sick and healed them.
(Mark 6:13)
Not only that, St. James also teaches:
Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and
let them pray over him, and anointing him with oil in the name of the
Lord; and the prayer of faith will save the sick man, and the Lord will
raise him up; if he has committed any sins, he will be forgiven.
(James 5:14-15)
According to these, it is clear that the sacrament of anointing of the sick was there in
the early Church. Anointing of the sick is the sacrament which confers the spiritual
strength, peace of mind and physical healing to a person who is seriously sick or in
the old age.
Teaching of the Church about this Sacrament
This is one of the seven sacraments which was specially intended to strengthen
the sick. From ancient times in the liturgical traditions of both East and West we
have testimonies to the practice of anointing the sick with blessed oil. Over the
centuries the anointing of the sick was confered more and more exclusively on
those at the point death. Because of this it received the name “Extreme Unction”
Notwithstanding this evolution the liturgy has never failed to beg the Lord that the
sick person may recover his health if it would be conducive to his salvation. In the
apostolic Constitution ‘sacred anoniting of sick’ (sacram unctionem infirmorum)
following upon the Second Vaticon Council, Pope Paul VI teaches:
The sacrament of Anointing of the sick is given to those who are
seriously ill by anointing them on the forehead and hands with
duly blessed oil - pressed from olives or from other plants - saying,
only once: “Through this Holy Anoniting may the Lord in his love
and mercy help you with the grace of the Holy Spirit. May the
Lord who frees you from sin save you and raise you up”. Amen
The Rite of Anointing of the Sick
² Introductory Rite
² Penitential Rite
² Liturgy of the Word
² Prayers of the Faithful
² Laying hands over the head
² Anoninting with the oil of infirmorum
² Giving the Holy comminion
² Blessing
Effects of the Sacrament of Anointing of Sick
³ The uniting of the sick person to the passion of Christ, for his own good and
that of the whole Church.
³ The Strengthening, peace and courage to endure in a christian manner the
suffering of illness or old age.
³ The forgiveness of sins if the sick person was not able to obtain it through the
sacrament of penance.
³ The restoration of health, if it is conducive to the salvation of his soul.
³ The preparation for passing over to eternal life.

forehead, “you are dust, remember one day you
become dust”
Holy Orders
There are two sacraments at the service of the community.
1. The Sacrament of Holy Orders
2. The Sacrament of Matrimony
These two sacraments are different from the other sacraments, because these two
sacraments;
1. Confir a particular mission in the Church
2. Build up the people of God
3. Are directed towards the salvation of others as well to personal salvation if
they contribute.
For an example,when children are born into a family, through the sacrament
of Matrimony the parents receive the responsibility to train their children and
guide them in faith. In the family, they provide a christian environments to their
children. This is an obligation of those who receive the sacrament of holy orders
and of the parents. To build up the people of God, new members are born into
christian families. They are baptised by those in Holy Orders.
Holy Orders
Holy Orders is the sacrament, through which the mission entrusted by Christ to His
Apostles, continues to be exercised in the Church until the end of time. There are
three degrees of this sacrament.
Degrees of Holy
Orders
Episcopacy (Bishops)
Presbyterate (Priests)
Diaconate (deacons)
The Bishop is the visible leader of the local Church. He participates in the mission of
the Church with authority as a member of the Bishops' conference and a transmitter
of the apostolic line.
All priests depend on their bishop to fulfill their mission. They take the responsibility
either to work in a parish community or in a ecclesial office. The appointment is
given by the bishop.
Deacons, participate in the ministry of divine word, divine worship, pastoral care
and the charity under the pastoral authority of the Bishop of that diocese.
Two Types of Priests

Sacrament of Matrimony
Picture 15.1 - Rite of the Sacrament Matrimony
What God has joined together, let no man put
asunder.
(Mark 10:9)
Marriage is an irrevocable covenant by which a man and a woman establish between
themselves with a firm decision. This covenant by which a man and a woman
accept each other through their free will, is a life long relationship (Matthew 19:6).
Therefore, even one or both parties decide to terminate their decision, the marriage
does not end.
The two characteristics of the catholic marriage
Unity
Indissolubility
i.e. a man can marry only one
wife and a woman can marry
only one husband
Indissolubility means
there can be no divorce.
The purpose of the catholic marriage
Mutual assistance and
completion love
Procreation and education
of children
The life long relationship of marriage
can be compared to the relationship
between Christ and the Church. This
intimate union of marriage has to be
built on mutual love. That love should
be developed day by day.
The purpose of
the catholic
marriage is to receive the children
as gifts of God and give them love,
protection, nourishment, christian
education and bring them up in a
christian atmosphere.
Children are a gift from the Lord, the fruit of the womb,
a reward.
(Psalm 127:3)
Impediments to a Catholic Marriage
³ Age :- Should complete the 18th year of age, But those who are between 23-29
years can give birth to healthy children.
³ Free will:- Nobody can force a person to marry a person whom he/she dislikes.
³ Murder :- If one murders are's spouse or another's spouse with the aim of a
marriage, that marriage is null and void.
³ Consanguinity
³ Mixed marriage
Marriage promise
The external sign of the sacrament of Matrimony is the marriage promise.
I ............ take
you ..............
to be my wife/husband.
I promise to be true to
you in good times
and in bad times, in sickness
and in health, I will
love you
and honour you all
the days of
my life.
The spouses mutually confer upon each other the sacrament of matrimony by
expressing their consent before the Church. The priest is the witness on behalf of
the Church. He blesses the marriage.
The marriage between two baptized persons is a sacrament and cannot be
dissolved.
For this reason a man shall leave (his) father and (his)
mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall
become one flesh. This is a great mystery, but I speak
in reference to Christ and the church. In any case, each
one of you should love his wife as himself, and the wife
should respect her husband.
(Eph 5:31-33)
Marriage and the Civil Law
According to the civil law of the Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, all marriages
should be registered at the Registrar's Office. Accordingly the marriages solemnized
at the Church, also should be registered in the government documents. It is done
by the parish priest. He has the faculties to act as a Registrar. This registration is
not relevant to the sacrament of matrimony. It is essential for the civil right of
a person. If registered or not in government documents, marriages done at the
Church is a sacrament and valid. Yet it has to be registered in the government
documents so that his/her civil rights are safeguarded. Catholic are not allowed
to register their marriages before non catholic ministers or civil Registrars. Such a
marriage is not a sacrament.
Divorce and Annulment
There is no divorce in the Catholic Church. It is because the Church has no power
to dissolve a valid marriage. It is a covenant, made before God. Yet after an inquiry,
before a Church marriage tribunal, the tribunal declares some marriages are null
and void from the beginning. That is, there had been no marriage on the ground of
an impediment for marriage or lack of consent.
For a Fruitful Catholic Marriage
³ Both parties should be Catholics
³ There should be mutual love and trust
³ Good character
³ Mutual understanding
³ Self sacrifice
³ Work for the unity of the family
³ Spiritual orientation for the duties of married life.
So they are no longer two, but one flesh.
(Matthew 19:6)

Religious Life
Historical background of the Religious life
In the early period monks lived a solitary monastic life. By the third century,
they lived in communities. Paul of Thebes is the first Christian hermit to live in a
monastry (227-342 A.D). At the time of St. Anthony of Egypt, a disciple of St. Paul
of Thebes, there were about 5000 monks, who lived in deserts. Later there evolved
'community-based' monasticism. They lived an ascetic life in communities for their
spiritual development.
St. Basil, St. Jerome, St. Augustin and St. Ambrose are considered to have done a
great deal of work for the development of the monastic life. St. Benedict and St.
Pachomius introduced a monastic rule for community life.
Religious should carefully keep before their minds the fact that the church
presents Christ to believers and non believers alike in a striking manner
daily through them. The church thus portrays Christ in contemplation on
the mountain, in His proclamation of the kingdom of God to the multitudes,
in his healing of the sick and maimed, in His work of converting sinners to
a better life, in His solitude for youth and His goodness to all men, always
obedience to the will of the father who sent Him.
(Lumen Gentium 46)
Religious life is a gift and a voctation, given by God to live upto the baptismal promises
more in a meaningful way or in a responsible manner. He/She, should proclaim the
word of God, not only by word but also by deed.
Chastity - Without entering into the
married life they dedicate their whole
life for the kingdom of God

Missionary Activity of Laity
Look at the picture above. There is a Church. Church is the centre of our
christian life. On the day of baptism all of us joined to our Church and our parish.
All who were baptized become members of the Mystical Body of Jesus Christ or
the members of the Church and also belong to the People of God. Because of that,
they participate in the common priesthood of Christ. This common priesthood
received at the baptism, is different from the ministerial priesthood.
Common Priesthood
Ministerial Priesthood
Every Christian receive at baptism
Those Christians who accepted the mission, entrusted to
the apostles become ministerial priests at ordination.
Those who received the common priesthood of Christ share in the tripple functions
of Christ.
1. Kingly or shepherdic function
2. Priestly Function
3. Prophetic Function
Those who receive the common priesthood of Christ have their own part to play
in the mission of the whole christian people in the Church and in the world (C.C.C
To succeed this mission all of us have to join and serve in the field of Lay
Apostolates. Second Vatican Council teaches: “By reason of the knowledge
competence or pre-eminence which they have, the laity are empowered - indeed,
sometimes obliged - to manifest their opinion on those things which pertain to the
good of the Church. If the occassion should arise this should be done through the
institutions established by the Church.” (Lumen Gentium - 37)
Catholic Daham Pasala (Sunday School)
The main task of the prophetic role is evangelization (C.C.C 905). Evangelization
is not only the task of priests and the religious but it is also the prophetic role of
the laity (C.C.C. 904). Therefore lay people who are capable and trained may also
collaborate in Catechetical formation, in teaching the sacred sciences and in use
of the communication media (C.C.C. 906). Because of that “Daham Pasala” is the
best place for a Christian to engage in his prophetic function which is given by the
common priesthood.
³ Spread the kingdom of God by carrying out the mission, launched by Jesus
Christ on this earth
³ Build up a deep intimate relationship with Jesus Christ
³ Form the Catholic children with moral values
Services

become the followers of Jesus Christ (catechism is taught voluntarily)
² Celebrating the Children's Day
² Holding the Bible quiz competitions
² Holding a Daham Pasal examination at the end of every year
² Updating the knowledge of the Catechists

Legion of Mary (Legio Mariae)
This is an apostoliate by the laity for the laity. It was started by Frank duff. It is a
strong Apostolic movement, functioned under the guidence of hierarchy and the

Protecting the Environment
Picture 18.1 - ‘Environment’
Red Indian leader, Seattle says: “Rivers are our brothers. They quench our thirst;
they carry our canoes and feed our children. We are part of the earth and it is part
of us, the perfumed flowers are our sisters; The bear, the deer, the great eagle, these
are our brothers; The rocky crest, the dew in the meadow, the body of heat of the
pony and man all belong to the same family.
The Environment which the Red indian leader appreciated is a gift of God, because
God is the Author of the creation. Earth, water, hills, animals are for man. The
creation of God is complete. It was good. Therefore man has to protect the creation.
Holy scripture testifies to it.
The importance of protecting the creation according to the First Creation
Story
The Earth which was formless and void became complete, beautiful and good
because of the creative work of God. By saying “Be fertile, multiply, fill the eanth
and subdue it” God gave that beautiful world or the divine creation to man's care
(Gen 1:28). The creation of God becomes a suitable place for man to live, if he
consumes it with preservation. We call it “ Sustainable Development” Where
ever there is sustainable development, equilibrium of the creation will be pro-
tected automatically.
Man was created into the “Image” and “Likeness” of God (Gen 1:26). In the
begining God made the universe. Therefore the man who is having the image and
likeness of God should re-create God's creation. Therefore man should develop
the creation. He can participate in the creative action of God, when he tries to
consume it carefully and work for its conservation.
God's will was to give man dominion over the creation (Gen 1:26). The Hebrew
word for domain is “Radah.” It means “conservation”.
The importance of protecting the Environment according to the Second
Creation Story
Having created the world, God created man and gave responsibility over creation.
The book of Gensin says:.
The Lord God then took the man and settled him in the
garden of Eden to cultivate and care for it.
(Genesis 2:15)
According to the Second Creation Story, God has given two responsibilities to
1. Cultivate : Hebrew word for “Cultivate” is ‘Abad.’. It means, “create
by working.” Therefore he is called to work and create, i.e. “preserve the
creation.” Therefore one who creates by work is a person who works to
conserve the God's creation.
2. Take Car e : The Hebrew word for “take care” is ‘shamar’ which means
conservation Even from this, it is clear that man has to conserve the creation.
If man fulfils these two obligations, he can find a better world for him to live. It will
bring prosperity and goodness to him.
Therefore if man does not protect the creation, he has to experience bad outcomes.
Today man is facing a lot of natural disasters, because he has gone against God's
plan. Some of them are floods, draughts earthslips ect. Therefore we should not
misappropriate the creation.
You have an obligation to protect and develop the environment. It involves the
following:
² Love and honour the environment
² Protect the fertility of the soil
² Beautify the world where we live
² Protect the equilibrium of the environment
² Avoid polluting the environment
² Live a simple life
² Protect the resources for the future generation
² Point out bad effects to the people who destroys the environment
² Develop the physical resources and share them generously
² Encourage others to share their resources with others
Activity
1. Write the meanings of the following Hebrew words
(a) Radah
(b) Abad
(c) Shamar
2. Explain briefly, how those three words are connected with the
preservation of environment.
3. Write and explain five activities that you can do to protect and develop
the environment.
4. “We are part of the earth and it is a part of us” Write in 100 words
how you develop the social, biological and physical environment as

Catholic Teachings about Peace
“Shalom” is the Hebrew word for peace used in the old Testament. “Shalom”
means inner peace. Truth, justice, love and freedom are the prerequisites for
peace. To have inner peace, we have to honour and respect others and their human
rights. Accordingly peace has a broad and deep meaning than abscence of war and
violence.
Peace is needed to protect and develop the lives of human beings. Building up
justice, sensitivity to the needs of others, honouring and respecting other and
brotherly love are important for that.
Jesus, the prince of peace came to this world to inculcate peace in the hearts
of mankind. Peace between man and God, which was destroyed by the sin has
been reestablished by his death on the Cross. Not only that, He invited all of us
to be the channels of peace by saying “Blessed are the peacemakers (Matthew
5:9). Jesus also instituted the Sacrament of Reconciliation and gave authority
to the Church to encourage every man to experience inner peace by receiving
Sacrament of Reconciliation.
Peace is necessary to protect and develop the lives of mankind. Peace is a gift
of Jesus Christ. Jealousy, hatred and revenge are the sins against Christian love.
Catering such feelings within ourselves for a long period can lead to a greater
sin. That is what happened to Cain. It is very important to control such feelings.
Because of that, Jesus taught us.
I say to you, whoever is angry with his brother will be liable
to judgement, and whoever says to his brother “Raqa” will be
answerable to the Sanhedrin, and whoever says “You fool” will
be liable to fiery Gehenna.
(Matthew 5:22)
Love your enemies and pray for those who hurt you, is the main theme of Christ's
teachings.
Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you,
that you may be children of your heavenly father, for he
makes his sun rise on the bad and the good, and causes rain
to fall on the just and the unjust.
(Matthew 5:44-45)
To have, Peace the following are necessary:
² Justice
² Love
² Protecting the weak
² Rejection of violent actions
² Stoping murder
² Protecting the human rights
Preventing the War
² It is dangerous to have war and collecting arms.
² Poverty of the world can be wiped out from the money, spent on war
² Christian duty is to reject the war and develop the inner peace
² Organizations should work to reject war and work against producing the arms.
Prayer of Saint Francis of Assisi
Lord make me an instrument of your
peace. Where there is hatred let me sow
love; where there is injury, pardon; where
there is doubt, faith; where there is despair,
hope. where there is darkness, light, where
there is sadness joy. Divine master, grant
that I may not so much seek to be consoled
as to console, to be understood as to
understand, to be loved as to love. For it is
in giving that we receive, it is in pardoning
that we are pardoned, it is in dying that we
are born again to eternal life.
Picture 19.1 - St. Francis of Assisi
We Should be the instruments of peace
We have to share peace that we gain by living in Jesus Christ, the prince of peace.

Spiritual and Corporal Works of Mercy
Benedict :- Father, is there an eternal life after death?
Father :- Yes son, after death, there is an eternal life.
Benedict :- Father, what should we do to gain eternal life
Father :-
Son, we should love our neighbour. For that we have to do works of
Mercy.
Benedict :- Father, what are works of Mercy?
Father :-
Son, you will understand. When you listen to this scripture passage
carefully.
When the son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels with
him, he will sit upon his glorious throne, and all the nations will be
assembled before him. And he will separate them one from another,
as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He will place
the sheep on his right and goats on his left. Then the king will say
to those on his right “come, you who are blessed by my Father.
Inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the
world. For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and
you gave me drink, a stranger and you welcomed me, naked you
clothed me, ill and you cared for me, in prison and you visited me”
Then the righteous will answer him and say, "Lord when did we see
you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? When did
we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you?
When did we see you ill or in prison, and visit you? And the king
will say to them in reply, “Amen, I say to you, whatever you did
for one of these least brothers of mine, you did it for me.” Then he
will say to those on his left, “Depart from me, you accursed into the
eternal fire prepared for the devils and his angels. For I was hungry,
and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, a
stranger and you gave me no welcome, naked and you gave me no
clothing, ill and in prison, and you did not care for me,” Then
they will answer and say “Lord when did we see you hungry or
thirsty or a stranger or naked or ill or in prison, and not minister
to your needs? He will answer them.” “Amen I say to you, what
you did not do for one of these least ones, you did not do for me.”
(Matthew 25:31-45)
I would give my bread to the hungry and my clothing to the
naked, If I saw one of my people who had died and been
thrown outside the walls of Nineveh, I would bury him.
(Tobit 1:17)
The above scripture passages show us that everybody will be judged at the sec-
ond coming of Jesus. The criteria or the measurement for judgement is the acts of
mercy. Though we have to observe the commandments of God as catholics, it will
not fulfil our every obligation. If we want to gain the kingdom of God, we need to
engage ourselves on spiritual and corporal acts of mercy.
The Corporal acts of mercy are concerned with the material needs others. There are
7 corporal work of mercy.
1. To feed the hungry
2. To give drink to the thirsty
3. To clothed the naked
4. To give shelter to the strangers
5. To visit the Sick
6. To free the captive
7. To bury the dead
The spiritual works of mercy are concerned with the spiritual needs of others. There
are 7 spiritual works of mercy.
1. To convert the sinner
2. To instruct the ignorant
3. To counsel the doubtful
4. To comfort the afflicted
5. To bear wrongs patiently
6. To pardon offences willingly
7. To pray for living and the dead
The spiritual needs of a man is fulfilled by the spiritual works of mercy. We can
enrich others by sharing our knowledge, talents, skills, thoughts and aspirations
with them.
The spiritual works of mercy are higher than the corporal works of mercy. Christian
love is not something sentimental or just a feeling within the heart. It should
be transformed into action. St. James says:
If a brother or sister has nothing to wear and has no food for the day,
and one of you says to them “Go in peace, keep warm, and eat well
but you do not give them the necessities of the body, what good is
(James 2:15-16)
The main concern of the corporal works of mercy are to fulfil the needs of the
human beings, Food, clothing, shelter, care in sickness and in sorrow are essential
to a person to live as a human being. Christ has told clearly that our final reward
will be decided on our charitable works i.e. caring the hungry, orphans, refugees,
the sick and prisoners. Anybody who helps the above mentioned people and fulfil
their needs is serving Christ, the king of the people of whole Universe.

Precepts of the Church
It is the responsibility and the duty of the Church leaders to prepare the background
to lead the Catholics according to the word of God. To realize that objective
Church leaders have formulated rules and regulations. The precepts of the Church
are important among them. The “Code of Cannon Law” contains regulations on
Church discipline and matters of other things. The commandments of God, the
precepts and the laws of the Church lead us to live as children of God. There are
five precepts of the Church.
1. Attend Holy Mass on Sundays and other days of obligation and rest from
servile work.
2. Go to confession at least once a year.
3. Receive Holy Eucharist (communion) at least once during the Easter.
4. Observe the prescribed days of fasting and abstinence
5. Contribute to the needs of the Church.
1. Attend Holy Mass on Sundays and holy days of obligation and rest
from servile work
Holy Mass is the sacrifice we offer to God, the Father, as people of God. Even
though it was presided by the priest, at the celebration the whole people of God
(faithful) join and partake in the offering. Because of this, chating, joking, looking
around or engage in other distractions during the holy Mass are not worthy. Such
things distract and disturb others. Therefore, such things have to be avoided.
The obligation of the Sunday and the holy days can be fulfilled by attending mass
in the evening of the previous day. But if there is a Holy Mass in your Church on
Sunday, it is more meaningful to attend the mass on Sunday itself.
The obligation does not bind persons who are seriously sick, living far away
from the Church or engaged in essential services and other similar circumstances.
In such instances they should try to attend a prayer service or engaged in private
prayer. One should not consider sunday mass as a burden but as an act of gratitude
to God for his loving kindness towards us. We should try to attend Mass, even on
week days though it is not a precept.
This precept oblige us to attend the ‘entire’ mass from the entrance hymn to the
final hymn. We should not be late for mass or going out before the end of the mass,
as a habit unless it is an unavoidable circumstance. It is also important to to be in
the Church before and after mass. The mental integrity that we receive from the
private prayer before mass, helps us to attend mass with great devotion.
2. Go to confession at least once a year
This precept binds all who have reached the age of reason i.e. those who know
what is right and what is wrong. Normally children are prepared for confession
and first holy communion at the age of seven. As soon as a grave or a mortal sin
is committed, it is a must to receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation. Therefore
the second precept binds us to seek forgiveness for our sins through confession.
If we make confession even without a grave sin, we receive the forgiveness of
sins and the strength and graces to avoid sins. Therefore we are called to make
a good confession in preparation for the Easter, the Church feast and Christmas.
As a result we can celebrate those feast in a graceful manner.
3. Receive Holy Eucharist (Communion) at least once during the Easter
The Catholics of the Middle Age were afraid to receive Holy Eucharist (communion).
Because of that, the Church implemented this precept. Today Church teaches us to
receive Holy communion at every Eucharistic celebration. Our participation for the
Holy Mass will be fulfilled when we receive Holy Communion.
4. Observe the prescribed days of fasting and abstinence
The Church establishes this precepts as an obligation of a christian to motivate
them in the faith and belief.
Abstinence
The abstinence means, to abstain from meat and meat products on prescribed days.
Such days are;
² Ash Wednesday
² Good Friday
² All Fridays of the year
But if a solomnity falls on a friday, this obligation is not observed eg. If christmas
falls on a Friday.
Fasting
Fasting implies only one full meal a day and a very light diet or no meal at other
two meals.
There are some reasons for fasting
1. For atonement for our sins.
2. To train self control
3. To imitate Christ who fasted for forty days in the wilderness.
The Church teaches to give to the poor as alms what is saved by fasting because it
is the main purpose of fasting. This precept binds only those catholics who have
completed 18th year of age and not reached 60 years. The sick and the aged are free
from this obligation. Those who are not obliged to fast are encouraged to do fasting
voluntarily. Those who are in age 18-60 are obliged to fast on ash Wednesday and
Good Friday. Besides prescribed days any body, is free to fast on the other days too.
5. Contribute to the needs of the Church
The stability of every institution or organization depends on the donations or
the contributions of its members. This precept calls the faithful to contribute for
the needs of the Church according to his/her own ability. Our donations, and
contributions will be utilized to maintain the Church, the people who does the
domestic work and other different charitable work in the parish.
Activity
1. Name the five precepts of the Church.
2. Write five points to show the importance of receiving the Holy
communion, to a friend who is reluctant to receive holy communion.

The Lord's Prayer
Picture 22.1 - Jesus with his diciples
Our father who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name,
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespass against us
Lead us not into temptations
But deliver us from all evil
The hymn, “Thri Eka Sura Jesune” is on Lord's Prayer. It was composed by Most
Reverend Father Jacome Gonsalves. Lords prayer which was taught by Jesus our
Lord, is the model prayer. The Holy scripture teaches us how we got this prayer.
He was praying in a certain place, and when he
had finished, one of his disciples said to him,
“Lord, teach us to pray just as John taught his
disciples.”
(Luke 11:1)
According to that, Jesus taught this prayer, as an answer to his disciples. St. Luke
and St. Matthew report this prayer in their gosples (Luke 11:2-4, Matthew 6:8-13)
St. Matthew reports:
Your Father knows what you need before
You ask him. This is how you are to pray:
“Our father in heaven, hallowed be your name
your kingdom come. your will be done
on earth as in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread.
and forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive those who trespass against us
and lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from the evil one.”
Matthew 6:8-13
The first phrase of this prayer is 'Our father in heaven' Lets find out the meaning
according to the teachings of the Church.
We can invoke God as “Father” because the son of God made man has
revealed him to us. In this son, through Baptism, we are incorporated
and adopted as sons of God. “Who art in heaven” does not refer to a
place, but to God's majesty and his presence in the hearts of the just.
Heaven, the Father's house, is the true homeland toward which we are
heading and to which, already we belong
C.C.C. 2798, 2802
In this prayer, there are three “wishes” and four petitions on spiritual and physical
needs. Here are the meanings of those.
1. “Holy be your name”
When we live a good life, it gives glory to God. Therefore we have to live a
life to glorify God's name.
2. “Your kingdom come”
This has a connection with the second coming of Jesus. Therefore we should
pray for the fulness of the kingdom of God.
3. “Your Will be done on earth as it is in heaven”
To complete the plan of salvation on this earth, it is our duty to integrate our
will with Jesus' will.
4. “Give us this day our daily bread”
Bread, our earthly sustanance and the spiritual sustanance, which are,
1. The word of God and
2. The Body of Christ, which is the Eucharis
We depend on;
i. Divine Providence for our daily sustanance.
ii. The nourishment we get through the word of God.
iii. The nourishment of Eucharist.
5. “And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against
With the example of Jesus Christ we get parden for our sins only if we have
forgiven the sins of others.
6. “Lead us not into temptations”
By this we ask from God
1. not to send temptations which lead us into sin.
2. asking the help of the Holy Spirit to understand the situation which lead
us into sin.
3. asking God to grant us the graces to be watchful and to persevere.
7. “But deliver us from Evil”
We pray to God to grant graces to defeat satan and aquire the life in Jesus
Christ.
Amen is a faith proclamation, which expresses our belief for the assurance of
getting things what we prayed and asked. The summary of St. Matthew's gospel is
in the Lord's prayers. It is a perfect of prayer, which teaches us not only to ask what
we need but to wish what we request.
Picture 22.2 - Reciting the Lord's Prayer
The Catholic Church teaches us, how to say the Lord's prayer
Simple and faithful trust, humble and joyous
assurance are the proper dispositions for one
who prays the Our Father.
C.C.C. 2797
When we say this prayer, we strech out our hands and pray to our God. In this
prayer, all of us are invited to maintain and keep up that posture because it is a main
feature of a prayer.
Structure of the Lord's Prayer
³ Praising - Our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy Name
³ Adoration - Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in
heaven
³ Asking for our Needs - Give us this day our daily bread
³ Asking forgiveness - Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who
³ Dependence on God's providence - Lead us not into temptations, but deliver
trespass against us
us from all evil
Before we say the Lords prayer, we have to forgive those who have hurt, punished,
damaged and insulted us. We must have the confidence that we are going to get
what we ask. Then we experience the power of prayer.
Activity
1. Mention three moments, that you tried to fulfil the will of God.

Marian Devotion
Mother Mary is the most honoured woman in the Catholic Church and no
other woman will get her place in the future too. The prayers, books, hymns,
literature, murals, paintings, names, shrines and Churches in her honour testify
to her popularity. All these shows her specific place in the Catholic liturgy and
devotions.
In the first three centuries, christians were martyred by the Roman emporers.
Therefore during that period, the Church focused her attention on martyrs. Yet
there are prooves to show that Mother Mary was given a special place in that
period too. The best proof is from the third century. It is the prayer, “we fly to thy
patronage.” It has been in use in the Church from the third century.
We fly to thy patronage, O Holy Mother of God.
Despise not our petitions in our neessities, but
deliver us always from all dangers, O glorious
and blessed virgin. Amen.
Theological Background of Marian Devotion
Mary said to Elizabeth: “All generations will call me blessed”
This became true through marian devotion. In marian devotion
we do not worship but honor her. We worship only God the
Father, Son and the Holy spirit.
C.C.C. 971
Here are the reasons why we honour Mother Mary
1. She was the mother of the Son of God
2. She was conceived without the original sin
3. She preserved her virginity before and after child birth
4. She was full of grace
5. She was free from sin
6. Assumed into heaven with body and soul
Immaculate conception
Due to a special grace, Mary was conceived in her mother's womb without the
original sin. Pope Pius ix proclaimed:
The Most Blessed Virgin Mary was from the first moment of
her conception, by a singular grace and privilege of almighty
God and by virtue of the merits of Jesus Christ, Saviour of the
human race, preserved immune from all stain of original sin.
(C.C.C. 491)
Accordingly, since Mary was chosen to be the mother of the Son of God, God
preserved her from the stain of original sin from the moment of her conception
as she was chosen for a very special purpose. Just as Mary was preserved from
original sin, we too were freed from original sin at our Baptism. Mary was
not only preserved from original sin, she also kept away from all kinds of sin.
Therefore those of us who have received the sacrament of Baptism should try
to avoid sin and lead a holy life.
Assumption of Mother Mary
Ascension is going to heaven by ones own power. Only Jesus could do it. “No
one has gone up to heaven, except the one who has come down from heaven
(Jn 3:13). Assumption is that somebody is lifted up to heaven by another person.
Therefore Mary was assumed into haven but she did not ascended into heaven.
Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches:
Finally the Immaculate Virgin, preserved free from all stain
of original sin, when the course of her earthly life was finished,
was taken up body and soul into heavenly glory, and exalted by
the Lord as Queen over all things, so that she might be the more
fully conformed to her son, the Lord of lords and conqueror of
sin and death. The Assumption of the Blessed virgin is a singular
participation in her son's Resurrection and an anticipation of the
Resurrection of other Christians.
C.C.C. 966
Picture 23.1 - Assumption of Mother Mary
At the end of her life, Mother Mary with her body and soul was lifted up into
heaven by God. Through her Assumption, Mother Mary was able to participate
in Jesus' Resurrection, which God had promised to everybody. When we
proclaim our belief in Mother Mary's Assumption, we too accept and believe
and proclaim our rising again to eternal life. That was verified by the statement
given by Jesus to his disciples.
And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back again
and take you to myself, so that where I am, you also may be.
(John 14:3)
Through his priestly prayer, we can understand the desire of Jesus to keep his loved
ones near to him.
I wish that where I am they also may be with me.
(John 17:24)
Mother Mary was able to assumed into heaven because she preserved herself from
all sins and lived a good life. If we want to experience the same graceful life that
Mary experienced, we have to avoid the sinful life. Then just as Mother Mary we
too can enjoy and inherit the same reward in the second coming of Jesus in glory.
Apparitions of Mother Mary
Mother Mary appeared several times with a Rosary in her hand. Those apparitions
gives the following messages:
1. God knows that we are undergoing a difficult time.
2. In this difficult time Mother Mary is showing her maternal love towards us.

an and asked for some milk for the infant. The boy accepted her request and gave
some milk. On reaching the customer's home, the boy apologized for his delay
and the reduced amount of milk by relating the incident. On inspection, the man
found the milk pot to be full and realized something miraculous had happened.
They went to the pond. Mother Mary appeared to them once again. Some years
later she appeared once again and cured a crippled boy.
Perpetual Help Novena
We have to attend Perpetual Help Novena to ask spiritual and worldly needs that we
are in want of in day to day life and thereby experience the divine love.
Rosary
The word ‘Rosary’ is from the latin word, ‘Rosarium.’ In sinhala we call it
‘Japamalaya’. The meaning of the word, Rosarium is “garland of Roses” or ‘chain
of roses.’ During the rosary we meditate the myteries or special incidents of the life
of Jesus and Mother Mary. Since the rosary is a powerful weapon we have to keep
it in the pocket, in the bag, in front of the vehicle and in hands of a dead person. It
gives a protection effectively.
In appearance, Mother Mary requested to recite the rosary for the conversion of
sinners in the world. We too are also sinners; Therefore, we have to say the Rosary
every day for the conversion of ourselves and others. According to the Liturgical
calander, Catholic Church annually celebrates many feasts in honour of Mother
Mary.

and prayed continuously with them in one mind and one heart (Acts 1:14) Ac-

of Jesus and the Mother of the Church. According to the Encyclical “Mysterium

Liturgy of Hours (Divine Office)
Picture 24.1 - Praying the Liturgy of hours
During the day, God is praised hour by
hour by praying liturgy of Hours
The four Hours at which the Divine office is prayed are:
1. Morning Hour
2. Midday Hour
3. Evening Hour
4. Night Hour
God who is the author of time should be praised and
honoured during the hours of the day. Therefore the day
could be sanctified by celebrating the Liturgy of Hours and
Liturgy of Eucharist (mass). “At dawn I will plead before
you” (Ps. 5:4)
According to the Hours, Divine office could be classified into four:
1. Morning Prayer (Lauds)
2. Midday Prayer
3. Evening Prayers (Vespers)
4. Night Prayers (Compline)
Evening prayer is called “vespers.” The service on the eve of a Feast day is based
on the Evening Prayer of the Liturgy of Hours. Therefore it is called Vespers.
As God is the Author of time and time belongs to Him, we praise God in every hour
of the day. Every time, every hour and every moment belongs to God. Therefore
there is no bad time; every time is auspicious; every time is good.
After the Second Vatican Council, this prayer is called “Liturgy of Hours.” Earlier
it was called “Divine Office.” This word also gives the above meaning. Observing
the Liturgy of hours is compulsory for priests and religious. This prayer is also
called “Work of God” “Canonical Hours” and “Breviary.”
According to the advice given by the apostles to “pray constantly” (1 Thes 5:15; Eph
6:18) it is important to sanctify the day by Praying Liturgy of Hours from morning to
evening. Priest, religions and laity participate in their common, priesthood received
through baptism by praying “Liturgy of Hours.” This prayers of the Church is the
address of the bride, the Church to her groom, Christ.
Liturgy of Hours is a community prayer of praising. Psalms are an indispensable
part of “Liturgy of Hours.”
The Canticle of Zechariah (Benedictus) (Luke 1:68 -79) is used in the Morning
Prayer: the Canticle of Mary (Magnificat) (Luke 1:46 -55) is used during the
Evening Prayers, and the Song of Simeon (Nuncdimittis) (Lk 2:29 -32) is used at
the Night Prayer. All three songs have been taken from the Gospel of Luke.
The Origin and development of the Divine Office
This is not a new way of prayer. Israelites prayed Psalms in synagogues. Even Jesus
and His disciples participated in those synagogue prayers. Therefore the Divine
Office or the Prayer of the Church has followed that tradition.
In the Apostohic age, christians attended the Divine Office in a specific
time. Later this was celebrated in a solomn way with the participation of
priests, religious and Lay people, headed by a bishop. Egeria, a spanish nun, was in
Jerusalem from 381-384 AD. While in Jerusalem, she wrote a diary and in it she
says that tradition of praying Divine Office was there at that time.
In the 4th century, after religious freedom, Religious orders developed. As a
result there was a big change in the Divine Office too. The Divine Office which was
headed by the Bishop with the Christian community at the Cathedral was known
as “Cathedral Model”; and the divine office which were said in the monastries was
known as 'monastic model.' Later in monasteries, the simple form of the prayer
was lost and it become more complicate. The number of times which has to say
the divine office increased. It was not suitable for the common people, because of
that lay people kept away from the Divine Office. Instead of the divine office some
supplementary prayers were introduced to the lay people. Therefore ‘Angelus’
was introduced to say in the morning, noon and evening. The Rosary also was a
substitute said by the lay people.
Unfortunately the practice of Divine Office is still limited to priests and religious.
It is not known or not popular among the lay people. But the Catholic Church will
greatly appreciate if it is prayed as a family, as an institution or privately.

Meditation
Three people were discussing about the posture at prayer. First person said, kneeling
down is the best posture to pray. The second said that the ascetics use to sit on
the ground with crossed legs. The third gave a completely different opinion. He
said when I am praying I keep my head looking up towards heaven, with closed
eyes. While they were talking, there was an electrician at a nearby place who
was reparing an electric system. He heard the discussion. He questioned. “I spend
my life on these lamp posts. I believe my life depends on God. Some times I pray to
God, while I am hanging my self with one leg. How do you describe that posture?”
At prayer, the most important thing is not the posture or not the place but the
praying in one mind and one heart. One way of praying is meditation. As Christians
our aim is not only to meditate for the sake of meditation but to have a good
relationship with God. That should be strengthend by being in a meditative mood
with the word of God, to be aware of God's presence. Jesus gives the best example
of prayer and meditation.
According to the nos 2705 - 2706 of Catechism of the Catholic Church, Meditation
is a quest: In this quest we must concern about two things.
1. Purpose of Christian life
2. Way of Christian life
We must be concerned about these things in order to adhere and respond to, what
the Lord is asking.
For meditation, different books may help but for Christians Sacred Scripture the
word of God is the most suitable book. In meditation, when we read the sacred
scripture challenges us. There by we can inquire, “Lord what do you want me to
do?” It helps us to take a decision to act in line with God's expectations firm.
History of Meditation
Till the 16th Centenary “Lectio Divina” or the contemplative prayer was the method
of meditation. There are four steps in the contemplative prayer.
1. Lectio or Read : In this step Holy Scripture is read
2. Meditatio or Meditate : In this step, Meditate upon the scripture passage which
was read
3. Oratio or Pray : In this step, pray over the scripture passage
4. Contemplatio or Contemplate : In this step, stay in the Lord, based on what was
read and meditated.
Contemplative prayer can be done only by the people who are in the highest level
of Meditation. Because of that, Discursive Meditation was introduced. There were
two steps in it.
1. Listening - Listening to the word of God
2. Meditation - Meditation upon the word of God, and inquire how much it is
lived. After evaluating, decide to live a pious life, by identifying and avoiding
our failiures. The decision is made to do away with the wrong and to live a
holy life.
The heresy of Quietism rose in 17th Century. The main concern of the Quietism
was the 4th step of “Lectio Divina” which is staying with the Lord. But there was
a small disadvantage in this kind of meditation because it was not based on sacred
scripture.
The Heresy of Jansenism arose in 19th Century. Accordingly one has to be perfect to
receive graces and to meditate and to enter into the sphere of contemplation.
After the second world war, Catholic Church resumed to give priority to meditation.
The literature and the documents of Saint Therese of Avila and Saint John of the
Cross influenced a lot for that renewal. The reawakening of the congregations,
specially the Trappists, Benedictines and Carmelites influenced on that too.
Today even in Sri Lanka we can notice that many are incline towards meditation.
According to that, it is good to give priority and importance for meditation. We can
follow the following steps to do a good meditation.
1. Daily rise early in the morning
2. Wash and clean the face, and have a cup of tea or a glass of water
3. Sit in an easy porsture
4. Focus your attention on breathing
5. Say a thanksgiving prayer for the New day
6. Read the Gospel of the day or any other Gospel passage
7. Meditate upon the gospel passage and see whether you have lived according
to that
8. Ask pardon from Jesus for the moments you have not lived
9. Take a decision to live accordingly in future
10.Meditate on the actions what you can do accordingly
11. Pray for the needs (of you, your family, friends, others who are having
different necessities)
12.Do the same breathing exercise
13.Start to study.
