Democratic Governance
Democracy is accepted globally as a more desirable method of good governance.
The main reason for this is that democratic government is based on people’s
participation and it represents public opinion. In this chapter, you will be able to
study the system of democratic government relevant to the following topics:
Characteristics of democratic governance
² Origin and the expansion of democratic governance
² Nature of the state and the government
Nature of the national state, its origin and expansion
² Role of the state
² Nature of constitutions and their characteristics
² Organizational structure and the performance of the government

Importance of democratic governance
Introduction to democratic governance
In the long history of civilization, man used to live together with a view of
facilitating the fulfillment of his basic needs. With the gradual development of
society, the need arose for an organized system of governance to facilitate the weal
of society and safeguard law and order.
Accordingly, various countries have practised different methods of
governance to rule them from the past. Monarchism (federal), aristocratic system
and democratic governance can be cited as examples. At present, most countries
including Sri Lanka are implementing democratic governance.

Democracy
In Sinhala,“praja” means people while “tantra” is the system of governance.
“vadaya” is the ideology. Accordingly, democratic governance is the governance
developed by the public to govern themselves.
If you consider the Tamil word ‘Makkaladchi’, ‘Makkal’, means people
and ‘adchi’ means governance. In that sense, Makkaladchi simply means public
governance.
The word ‘democracy’ is derived from the Greek words ‘Demos’ and ‘Kratos’.
‘Demos’ denotes public while ‘Kratos’ denotes power. So the Greek meaning of
the word is power of the people. The system of government which allows people to
participate in the administration directly and indirectly is democratic government.
The origin and the expansion of democratic governance
There is historical evidence to show that some features of democratic
governance had existed in both the East and the West.
Fig 1.1 - Caryatides arena-Athens Greece
Fig 1.2 - Parthinan Accropolis Athens Greece
The governance of the Greek city-state (polis) of Athens was based on direct
democratic principles. The supreme governing body of the city-state of Athens was
the Citizen's Council that consisted of citizens in the government in Greece. The
citizens' opinion on the functions of government have been directly considered in
the Citizen's Council. Therefore, the citizens were given an opportunity to take an
active part in the government. But urban women, slaves and foreigners were not
allowed to participate in it. This method of governance in Athens was recognized
as direct democratic governance. Collective decision making can be cited as direct
democratic governance.

History records about a republican government in the “Vajji” kingdom of
India in the sixth century B.C. The seven principles of “Aparihani Dhamma” of
Vajji kingdom can be seen in the present democratic governance too. Some of them
are given below.
² Regular meetings and discussion.
² Meet, discuss and leave peacefully.
² Avoid framing of non-functional laws, strict enforcement of framed laws, and
obedience to framed laws.
² Respect elders, obey and respect their advice and abide by them.
Accordingly, this shows how the East followed the principles of democracy
in their governments.
From 5th century A.D. up to the 15th century A.D. the feudal system existed
in Europe. After the 15th century A.D. the advancement of commercial economy
took place replacing the agricultural economy which was based on service bound
land use. At the same time, a capitalist class also emerged. After the 15th century
A.D. national states came into existence in Europe. With the spread of liberal ideas,
the freedom of the individual was greatly appreciated.
The power of the people’s representatives took precedence over that of the
monarchy. The English Revolution (Great Revolution) that took place in 1688 is
an example of this. Later, the power of the Parliament which consisted of people’s
representatives began to develop.
Types of democratic governance
When we inquire about democratic governance, two main types of it can be noticed.
² Direct democracy
Indirect democracy (Representative Democracy)
Direct democracy
The governance which existed in the Greek city-state (polis) of Athens is a good
example of direct democracy.
Direct democracy is the system in which people gather in one place, discuss
and take collective decisions on state administrative functions with the
consent of the people swiftly and directly.
- Professor Garner

The problems arising out of implementing direct democracy at present,
² The large land masses of present states
² Vast population of present states
² The difficulty of getting all the citizens to rally in one place
² Complexity of social needs
Indirect democracy
Considering the practical problems in implementing direct democratic
governance, the system of elected representatives emerged. It is called indirect
democracy or representative democracy.
Indirect democracy took root in Europe as an instrument of administration.
Philosophic ideas nurtured it further. As a result, representative institutions such as
the Parliament came into being.
“Democracy is, government of the people by the people and for
the people”
- Abraham Lincoln -
“Democracy provides rights for everybody as a tool of governance”
- Sealer -
In a representative democracy, the citizens themselves cannot take part in the
governance. The opinion of the voters is directly assessed in some countries where
representative democracy is practised.
The referendum in the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of
Sri Lanka, is one such example.
Importance of democracy as a system of governance
Most of the present states consist of multicultural societies. In such a society,
every member of the population can become a partner in the mechanism of
governance.
In most countries, government bodies have been established to enable
people’s representation at both national and local levels.
² Democracy is useful as a system of government, as it builds up on the people’s
will. The representative is elected on the majority will.
The government is formed by the party or group which elects the majority of
representatives.
The laws are passed by the majority decision of the elected representatives.

The importance of democracy as a way of living
Democracy plays a major role in society and as a way of living. A democratic
society respects different opinions, taking decisions by consensus, respecting
equality while enjoying rights and fulfilling related duties.
A society which adheres to such conditions automatically creates
opportunities for the smooth implementation of democracy.

consideration, draft a simple definition.
² Prepare a note which contains the qualities that one should develop as
a member of a democratic society.
Characteristics of democratic governance
Election of governments and rulers using universal franchise
In a democratic country, ruling representatives are elected by general
franchise. Moreover, franchise is utilized in referendums in direct democracies.
Franchise is bestowed on all the citizens over a particular age limit. Voting
power is granted irrespective of sex, community, employment or income. It is
known as universal franchise.
In article 3 of the constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri
Lanka, it is mentioned that;
In the Republic of Sri Lanka sovereignty is in the people and
is inalienable. Sovereignty includes the power of government,
fundamental rights and the franchise.

Competitive party system
Political parties are an essential component in the operation of democratic
government.
A political party, is an organized entity of persons formed with the aim of
acquiring ruling power of a country based on principles of its governance.
The opportunity given to a number of competitive parties to gain political
power in a country is called competitive party system. It can be noticed that, they are
in constant competition to acquire power presenting various political and economic
programmes. Accordingly, the people can select their party on their own.

Polling division system
It is necessary to divide the country into polling divisions as a strategy
to involve people’s representatives for democratic governance. Based on these
divisions representatives are elected to the legislature and local governments. The
simple majority representation and the system of proportional representation are
followed mostly in electing members at present.
According to the constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of
Sri Lanka, polling divisions are divided by the Delimitation Commission. For this
purpose, the land and population are taken as the main criteria.
The electoral map of Sri Lanka is given below as an example.

Electing representatives to government bodies is a cornerstone in a
democratic country. Similarly elections give the opportunity for the government to
obtain the participation of the people in administrative functions.
Elections are essential for the existence of democracy and holding free and
fair elections is also an essential factor. The voters must be able to choose a political
party or a group and vote freely. Candidates too should be able to engage in the
election process freely.
Characteristics of a free and fair election
Holding elections in due course
² All the eligible citizens must be assured of their vote/candidacy in a free and
fair manner

Existence of a government and an opposition
In an election for the selection of representatives for government bodies, the
party which wins a majority of representatives becomes the government in a
democratic system of government. Administration rests with the government. At an
election, the party or parties which get a minority of representatives forms the
opposition.

Freedom, equality and rights
In simple terms, the state in which an individual is allowed to fulfill political,
economic and social needs can be defined as ‘freedom’.
In simple terms, freedom is the opportunity for developing one’s personality
sans external resistance.
- G.D.H. Cole -
It is very important that this freedom is enjoyed so as to cause no hindrance
or obstacle to the other members of society. Freedom can only be enjoyed within
the boundaries of law.
The freedom that the individual gets to consummate his life, contributes in
general to the progress of society as a whole.
Providing every individual with equal opportunities is equality. What
is implied here is the provision of opportunities for the enjoyment of rights and
freedom to everyone without any discrimination.
Execution of qualities such as freedom and equality depends on safeguarding
rights. Rights can be interpreted as the entitlements of humans given by society to
consummate his social life
Human rights can be defined as the entitlements unfavoured by any means
which humans receive at birth to lead a prestigious life in society.
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was proclaimed by the United
Nations General Assembly on 10th December 1948. This is an important instance in
the history of winning human rights. By this, human rights were legalized.
Entertaining the rights of a person properly results in leading a healthy
social life. The intention of providing rights in a democratic society is to develop
the whole society through personal development. Social development is established
by performing duties combined with rights. Education is one example of the rights
you are entitled to. It is your responsibility to dedicate knowledge and skills gained
through education for social development.

Act in accordance with the constitution
The basic law of a country is the constitution. Under a democratic system of
administration, governance of the country takes place in conformity with the
constitution.
The constitution is a document which defines the formation, the execution
and the powers of the major component of a government, which are the
legislature, executive and the judiciary and describes the relationship
between the said institutions with the people.
- Professor Ivor Jennings -
Though there is no consensus about the contents of a constitution. But, most of
the constitutions consist of the following;
² How the major components of the government, the legislature,
executive and the judiciary are constructed
² The tasks, powers and the relationships in the said institutions
² The nature of the relationship between the government and the people

Media freedom and the right of access to information
The people of a democratic country have freedom of expression and access
to information. This is fulfilled by the media. Media is the main factor in forming
public opinion.
The people have a right to know about the activities and the decision making
process of the government. It is an essential factor of good governance. Likewise
the media has the ability to make the government aware of public opinion.
Media freedom is of paramount importance in a democratic country to form
public opinion.

Independence of the judiciary
The judiciary plays the role of dispensing justice. In a democratic society
the judiciary plays a major role in safeguarding freedom and protection of rights.
The judiciary should be independent and free from the influence of the
legislature and the executive, and any other aspects. Constitutions of modern states
have taken numerous steps to protect the sovereignty of the judiciary. Independence
of the judiciary ensures that equity and justice is meted out to the people as well as
judiciary.
Establishment of the Judicial Service Commission is one of the important
steps with regards to independence of Judiciary.
The supremacy of law and equality before law
In a country, law is above all. It is the supremacy of the law. It is compulsory
that both the rulers as well as subjects must obey and respect the law. They should not
over rule the law. It should be practised equally for both the rulers and subjects.
The application of law irrespective of nationality, caste, creed, or sex or an
individual basis is in brief called equality before law.
Features that illustrate the supremacy of law
Punishing the offenders under the existing law
² Everybody to respect the law, obedient to the law and not superseding it
² Arresting individuals only on the basis of an indictment
² Equality before law.
² Everybody to get the protection of law in absolute fairness

The State
While the state is a permanent institution, the government is an institution
subject to changes from time to time. Present state is considered a national state,
and there are four basic characteristics evident in such a state. They are land,
population, government and autonomous power.
² Land area is demarcated by fixed frontiers.
² The maritime boundary.
² The sky above the land area.
Population
² The population living within the land limits.
Government
² Safeguarding law and order and motivating people to fulfill common goals
within the state are entrusted to the government.
Autonomous power
² Autonomous power is the authority that can be applied for the sake of the
public without the intervention of any particular internal or external force.
Autonomous power helps in enacting laws and in obtaining the allegiance of
the public to such laws.
Definitions presented about the state
“ The state is a community of persons more or less numerous,
permanently occupying a definite portion of territory, independent
of external control and possessing an organized government to
which the great body of inhabitants render habitual obedience ”

Unitary states are states where power is concentrated with central
governments to implement the legislative, executive, and the judicial power.
In a unitary state, local governments implement the administrative powers
vested by the central government. (further details are given in chapter 2)

² Promulgation of laws
² Management of finance
² Control of the executive
Executive
Fig 1.5 - Parliament of Sri Lanka
The executive is the implementing body of the laws promulgated by the
legislature. The selection procedure of members depends on the nature of the
constitution. In a parliamentary government, the executive consists of the Prime
Minister and the cabinet. The political party which wins the majority of seats in a
general election gets the opportunity to form the cabinet.
In a presidential government, the president is the head of the executive. the
president is elected by a presidential election.
Judiciary
The judiciary sorts out the disputes arising out of the implementation of the
laws enacted by the legislature. The main function of the judiciary is the dispensation
of justice. The judiciary plays a major role in protecting the rights of citizens and
safeguarding the constitution.
In federal states, the problems that crop up between the central and regional
governments are solved by higher seats of the judiciary.

Forms of government
In modern states two types of government are to be seen. They are;
² Parliamentary government
Presidential government
Parliamentary government
A parliamentary government consists of a parliament with representatives
elected by the people for a fixed term, a cabinet appointed by the parliament and an
independent judiciary.
In a parliamentary government the executive is directly appointed by
parliament from the elected representatives. As such the executive is directly
responsible and answerable to parliament. Hence the parliamentary system of
government is described as a government of responsibility. The Prime Minister and
the cabinet are collectively accountable to the parliament. If it deviated from this
process the legislature can defeat the government at any moment.
There are two types of parliamentary government: the nominal executive and
the political executive. In Britain, the nominal executive is the king or the queen. It
comes down as a tradition.
The political executive in a parliamentary system of government is the Prime
Minister and the cabinet.
Features of a parliamentary system of government
It consists of two types, i.e. the nominal executive and the real executive.
(Political executive)
² The executive is elected by the legislature.
² A direct relationship exists between the executive and the legislature.
² The legislature has the power to remove the executive.
The executive is collectively responsible to the legislature.

Special features of the presidential system of government
The President implements executive power.
² The President is the leader of the government and the state.
² The executive is not directly responsible to the legislature.
² The legislature does not control the executive directly.

Factors essential for the success of democratic governance
A series of factors are essential for the success of democratic governance.
Some of them are stated below;
Free and fair elections
An opportunity was provided to learn the features of a free and fair election
under the “ features of democratic governance ”.
The rulers are selected by the elections based on the universal franchise.
The voter must be given the opportunity to cast his vote free of influence, according
to his political opinion. It is a basic feature of a free election.
A fair election is one in which all the political groups are allowed to engage
in election activities equally, in a suitable environment free from corruptions and
malpractices.
Holding elections alone is not adequate for the existence of democracy;
they should be free and fair.
Gaining power in a free and fair election is a requirement to obtain public
support, confidence and acceptance towards the rulers. This is called the legitimacy
of a government.
Existence of the supremacy of the law
The laws are the rules promulgated by the government to control the external
behaviour of citizens. The obedience submission to the law and respecting those
by both rulers and subjects should be done, without superseding the laws. The
existence of the supremacy of the law is helpful for the government to maintain its
affairs unobstructed and to establish public confidence.
For free distribution
Independence of the Judiciary
The judiciary is considered the main tower in
building democracy. Maintenance of this institute without
any influence is essential in democracy. The judiciary
should exist impartially as an institute free of undue
influence to dispense justice and fairness according to the
existing law.
Then only justice could be dispensed to all the
Fig 1.6
citizens of the country according to the existing law. Democratic governments set
up provisions in the constitutions to protect the sovereignty of the judiciary. The
existence of an independent and impartial judiciary is vital to setup a just and a law
abiding society.
Existence of people with political intelligence
Bringing a people friendly government into power is of paramount
importance for successful democratic governance. The voter is of prime importance
in this process.
The political parties and groups present their policies to the people. The
voters should be politically intelligent to vote correctly taking such policies into
consideration.
Moreover, the voter must display concern to elect the candidates of
exemplary character in society and great leaders devoted to build the nation. The
intelligent voter must be concerned to prevent the selection of politicians who are
guilty of offences in society. Thereby the voter is able to build good governance in
the country. The existence of intelligent, politically educated public is very essential
in building a peaceful political environment free of fraud and corruption.
Activity
² Make a list of matters a voter should pay attention to when deciding to cast
his vote.
Existence of a sound economic standard
Fulfillment of fundamental rights to the highest standard is a key factor in
strengthening democracy. The availability of food, clothing, housing, education,
health and common amenities adequately is useful for the existence of a democratic
society.
Existence of qualities like freedom, rights and equality depends on the sound
economic level. To achieve these conditions, social welfare is also undertaken by a
democratic government.

Availability of free and unbiased media
You will be able to learn the role played by the media under ''the features of
a democratic governance.''
As the right to access information is an essential factor in a democracy, it
is the task of the media to ensure it. Therefore, the existence of an environment
conducive to the provision of information in a free and unbiased manner is essential
for the success of democracy. Media has an obligation and a responsibility to
provide unbiased and true information with a sense of responsibility. The media
can build public opinion correctly by doing so.
Democratic life
Establishment of democratic principles in society is vital for the success of
democratic governance. A democrat should have the following qualities.
² Taking decision through discussions
² Tolerance of opposite views
² Respecting majority decision
² Co-operation
² Respect for human rights
² Obedience to law
² Enjoying rights while fulfilling duties
Identifying factors that hinder democracy and present constructive criticism.
Accordingly, the members of institutions like the family, school, higher
educational institutes and places of employment must appreciate democratic
principles in conducting their affairs.
Importance of democratic governance
Enjoyment of equal rights
Democracy is based on basic concepts such as personal freedom, rights, and
equality. In a democracy, all citizens are entitled to equal rights irrespective of
differences. No one is discriminated. There are provisions to establish a suitable

of a constitution and acting in accordance with it in a democratic country is an
example of this.
Possession of equal rights, building social integrity, reducing social conflicts
help personal development. The opportunity to enjoy equal rights contributes to the
development of the entire society.
Opportunity to develop personal abilities and skills
The citizens of a democratic country have the opportunity to develop their
skills to the maximum. An individual has the opportunity to develop his intelligence,
abilities and various skills. There are no limitations or obstacles imposed in this
regard.
Not only opportunities provided to acquire education and vocational training
but special identified skills are also improved.
Enjoyment of freedom and rights based on equality are of great help for the
development of personal abilities and skills.
Opportunity for the citizens to take part in the government
A special feature of democratic governance is the political right of the
people to take part in governance. Since they cannot take part directly, it is done
through representatives. Hence, the rulers are elected by voters through universal
franchise. The citizens have the opportunity to engage in election activities. One
can present himself as a candidate. Moreover, by being vigilant of the activities of
an elected government, a citizen can present his opinion.
Priority to human development
Food, housing, education, health, employment and other common amenities
are factors which affect human development. These factors are instrumental in the
qualitative development of the living conditions of the people.
In a working democracy, various political parties contest to gain power. In
this contest, priority is mostly given to the party manifesto (policies) that bring
people's welfare.
It is a special feature in democracy, to pay special attention in providing
facilities. With the development of democracy the state has become a welfare
institute in the last decades of the 20th century.
For free distribution
In some democratic countries, services such as education and health are
provided free of charge. Sri Lanka is one such example.
Foundation for the development of a peaceful society
Most countries at present are multi- racial and multicultural societies. Every
citizen is a partner of the administration in a democratic country. The following
aspects have contributed to build a peaceful society
² Existence of the supremacy of law
Independence of the judiciary
² Freedom, equality and possession of equal rights
² Respect for majority decisions
² Regard for minority opinion
² Come to decision through discussions
² Opportunity for peaceful expression of ideas of the citizen
Social welfare
The transition of the state into a welfare organization occurred with the
advent of democracy in the early decades of the 20th century. As a result, special
attention was paid to social activities which contributed to the quality of the standard
of living of the citizens in a democratic government.
The government's role in the administration of the programmes on education,
health, housing, transport, social security, poverty alleviation and caring for the
aged are examples for this.

Decentralisation and Devolution
of Power
Introduction
The ability a state possesses to implement the administrative affairs of that
state is, described in simple terms as power. While the final authority of power
is the public and that power possessed by the public is described as sovereign
power. The three areas: administrative power, voting power and basic rights, are
included in this. There are several aspects of power. Political, administrative,
social and economic are some of them. One way of defining the concept of
power from the point of view of political science is the administration of power
according to their wishes in order to control those subject to their power and
should those being controlled fail to accept, ensure acceptance through the use
of force.
This power which the state has, can be decentralized, or devolved.
Accordingly, the present day states decentralize as well as devolve power. The
power of a state is subject to decentralization as well as devolution based on
the need of that state. If some state, for convenience of administration devolves
only the administrative power upon regional administrative units, this is called
decentralization of power. Similarly if some part of the threefold power involving
legislative, executive and judiciary of the central government is devolved upon
regional units of administration through the constitution, this is described as
devolution of power.
By studying this lesson unit, you will be able to understand the concept
of power, its different facets, decentralization and devolution of power, unitary
and federal systems of government, and with our past experiences, we can
understand how power is devolved in countries like the United States of America
and Switzerland.

Power
The ability a state possesses to implement the administrative affairs of that
state is, defined as power. While the final holder of power is people, that power
owned by them is described as sovereign power. Administrative power, franchise
and fundamental rights are included in this.
The manner in which sovereign power is implemented in Article 4 of the
1978 constitution is as follows,
The sovereignty of the people shall be exercised and engaged in the following
manner.
(a) The legislative power of the people shall be exercised by the parliament,
consisting of elected representatives of the people and by the people at
a referendum.
(b) The executive power of the people, including the defence of Sri Lanka
shall be exercised by the President of the Republic, elected by the
people;
(c) The judicial power of the people shall be exercised by parliament
through courts, tribunals and institutions created and established, or
recognized, by the constitution, or created and established by law,
except with regard to matters related to the privileges, immunities and
powers of parliament and of its members where as the judicial power
of the people may be exercised by parliament according to law.
Types of the Power
The concept of power takes various forms. Political power, administrative
power, social power, economic power etc., are some examples for it.
In accordance with the view point of political science, power has been
described as “the ability to govern the subordinates as per the consent of the
governors and the ability to obtain immunity by force when it is contrary to the
consent.”
From the view point of economics, “the attempt taken to control others in
an economy by a group of authorized persons” has been defined as power with the
view point of economic science.
It has been described sociologically as “the ability to exceed persons of the
society and existing social organizations” as power.

Decentralization of Power
Decentralization of power means the assignment of some of the powers
vested in the Central Government, upon regional units of administration or
otherwise, the devolution of the powers of the Central Government upon regional
units in order to facilitate administrative functions and also to involve regional
individuals in administrative activities.
One outstanding feature evident in the decentralization of power is that it is
implemented through an Act passed by the legislature. Similarly, another feature is
that such power can be re-vested in the central government at any moment. The best
example, that can be given is the decentralization of power on Local Government
Bodies in Sri Lanka.
Through the decentralization of power the responsibility of formulating
plans, management, acquisition of resources and their distribution have been
assigned to regional level administrative bodies, local government bodies, provincial
governments, semi - independent public authorities and corporations.
Decentralization of powers of the central government can be implemented
in various ways. Decentralizing the pattern of administration is one of them. It
will be possible to understand how the administrative power from national level to
regional level, is decentralized, from the examples below.
National level
District level
Regional level
Ministry Secretary
District Secretary
Divisional Secretary
Grama Niladhari division level
Grama Niladhari
Assignment of the functions of central government to regional administrative
units, is one aspect of decentralization of power. Under this, formation of the local
authorities (Local Government Bodies): Municipal Councils, Urban Councils,
Pradeshiya Sabha are examples.
Another aspect of decentralization of power is the assignment to regional
units the powers that belong to state enterprises or state authorities. In this regard,
necessary powers are vested in different departments, corporations and authorities
to run state enterprises. e.g. State Petroleum Corporation, Sri Lanka Ports Authority.

Unitary State
What happens in the decentralization of power is the assignment of only
administrative powers of the state to regional administrative units. In other words,
legislative, executive and judicial powers are handled by a single center of power.
A unitary state is a state where the legislative, executive and judicial powers
are executed and controlled by a single central government. No devolution of
power takes place in a Unitary State. Local government bodies can exist as some
administrative powers of the central government have been decentralized in order
to facilitate administrative functions. Local government bodies operating in Sri
Lanka can be cited as an example. While the assignment of administrative powers
to local government bodies are vested through an Act of Parliament, there is also
the ability for the Central Government to withdraw such powers from local bodies,
at any moment.
Professor Herman J. Finer, the eminent political scientist, points out that,
“If all types of executive powers are concentrated on a single institution, this
becomes a Unitary State.”
Characteristics of a Unitary State
² Exercising the Executive, Legislative and Judicial power by a single central
government.
Decentralization of only the above administrative powers to regional
administrative units with the objective of facilitating the administrative
functions of the central government.
Decentralization of administrative power is only possible through an Act
passed by the legislature of the Central Government.
² The ability to revert the administrative power that have been decentralized, at
any instance the Central Government desires.
Devolution of Powers
The assignment of the executive, legislative and judicial power vested in the
Central Government to local Government Bodies by an Act of Parliament is termed
as devolution of power. This can be implemented only through the constitution.
If power is devolved newly or the vested power is revised by any means, the
existing constitution should be amended.

Reasons for the devolution of power in Modern States
Need for unity to be built up amidst diversity.
What this implies is to gather all the groups who speak different languages,
follow different religions and belong to different ethnic groups under a
common principle of nationhood to participate in the functions of government
while respecting the identity of the respective groups.
The difficulty of administration from a single central position because of the
size of the state.
² Ensure national security.
Federal States
You have learnt that the assignment of the Legislative, Executive and
Judicial power of the Central Government to regional units of administration is
devolution of power. States that have implemented such devolution of power are
called Federal States or in other words the states where Legislative, Executive
and Judicial power of the Central Government is assigned to regional units of
administration by the constitution itself are Federal States. Division of power
between the Central Government and State Governments is a basic feature of the
Federal System of government. Instead of a single center for power, two types of
centers as central and state, can be seen in Federal States. Similarly, sometimes, the
existence of two systems of law, such as laws of the Central Government and the
laws of the State Government can be seen in a Federal State.
Federal States are formed due to various reasons and factors. One such
factor is the union of several independent states and the creation of a Federal State
to facilitate administrative functions.
Normally, Local Governments or Federal States are called states. Sometimes
some other specific terms are in use to designate a federation.
eg - The Local Governments functioning in Switzerland are called Cantons.

Characteristics of a Federal State
² There is a written constitution.
² Demarcation of powers of federal states as well as Central Government clearly
in the constitution.
² Assignment of power of interpretation to the constitution to a higher judiciary
e.g. Federal jurisdiction of the United States of America.
² Establishment of an upper house of representatives (Senate) e.g. : Senate of
the United States of America.
Characteristics of a federal state for its effective existence
² Affecting as per the existing constitution of the state.
All ethnic groups to exist with common feeling.
Providing financial resources to federal states in a fair manner.
New tendencies of federal states
Federal states as well as the Central Government are treated equally in a
federal system. Nevertheless the general tendency for the central government to
become powerful could be seen when in operation. The central government has
the ability to lead federal states. Some factors which have affected to create such a
situation are as follows;
² Although the consent of federal states is obtained to amend the constitution of
the government, neglecting the consent of federal states in making ordinary
laws.
In instances of interpretation of the constitution, it is done to the advantage of
the Central Government.
² The Central Government has become the strongest in the implementation of
financial deals between the Central Government and federal states. Federal
states depend on the financial allocations made by the Central Government.
These are provided subject to various conditions.
² As the welfare provided by the government increases, its responsibility is
assigned to the Central Government.
Co-ordination is accelerated as a result of modern developments in
communication and transport services.

According to the above diagram what has taken place in decentralization is,
vesting only administrative powers of the Central Government to administrative
units. It should be understood that the said Regional administrative units are not
called prefectures or independent states. The Provincial Council system which is in
operation now in our country is a fine example.
Decentralization means a split of the task of the Central Government, and federal
states or independent administrative units will evolve thereby. Decentralization
taken place where it is necessary to facilitate independent administrative units.
Decentralization as well as devolution of power has been done in some federal
states.

Unitary Government
You have already studied what the concept of decentralisation of power
means. We have identified the states which have decentralised power as unitary
states. The governments which are in power in the unitary states are identified as
unitary governments. Given below is a definitions of a unitary state.
"If the authorized power has been agglomerated in one central
authorized institute however it is called a Unitary State"
- Professor Hermon J. Fainer -
The following governments are examples of unitary governments.
² Sri Lanka
² Great Britain
² France
Characteristics of a Unitary Government
You have learnt what a Unitary Government is. Two ideological views
are expressed by two political scientists on several characteristics of a Unitary
Government, appears below;
“One central authority vested with the power to enforce law is the basic
feature of a Unitary Government.”
- Prof. A.V. Dicey -
Supremacy of the Central Government and absence of extra sovereign
bodies in the Government is the main feature of a Unitary Government.
-Prof. C.F. Strong -

Accordingly, features of a Unitary Government are stated as follows;
Parliament, the legislature of the Central Government, is the highest law
making authority.
² Decentralization of power to Local Government bodies to facilitate
administrative functions. (e.g: Pradeshiya Sabha, Urban councils and
Municipal Councils functioning at present in Sri Lanka)
² Concentration of Sovereign power of the state in one center (Central
Government)
² Centralization of Legislative, Executive and Judicial power in the Central
Government.
Advantages of a Unitary System of Government
² The ability of taking quick decisions easily by the government
Inconsistencies between bodies which exercise power such as Central
Government and State Governments are less due to the non-existence of such
bodies.
² Government and the Judiciary are common to the whole state.
Federal Government
The governments which exist in federal states are called Federal
Governments. The outstanding feature of a Federal Government is the division of
power of government between the Central Government and the Local bodies.
Two definitions of eminent political scientists are given below.
"It is a government which paves the way for unity through
diversity".
- A.V Dicey -
''Though it has independence to act within the power range, at
times, the way is open for acting together on some aspects''

Salient features of a Federal Government
Building a common nationality respecting ethnic diversity in a multi ethnic
community.
² Facilitates administration in countries with a large land mass
² Facilitates prevention of a state becoming dictatorial as a result of the force and
influence brought upon the Central Government by the regional government.
² Strengthening of the framework of democracy.
Unwholesome features of a Federal Government
² The dissatisfaction among the State Governments about the powers awarded
under decentralisation.
² The tendency of states attempting to separate themselves from the Central
Government.
The collapse of administration as a result of inconsistencies in decision
making between the Central Government and the State Government.
² Delay in the constitution - mating process due to the existence of a second
legislature.
² Scarcity of efficient officers resulting in failures in the administration of states.

History of decentralization and devolution of power in
Sri Lanka
History of decentralization of power in Sri Lanka
The concept of decentralization of power is not novel to Sri Lanka. When
observing the systems of government that prevailed in the distant past of our country
it is obvious that decentralization of power had taken place in different forms to
facilitate the functioning of the government.

Examples
² Appointment of officials named “Gambara”, “Gamani” by King
Pandukabaya during the Anuradhapura era to govern villages.
² Appointment of local government officials with administrative powers by
King Parakramabahu during the Polonnaruwa era.
² Appointment of local government officials to maintain the governance
unchanged with the migration of westerners.
e.g: Appointment of a “Resident officer” at provincial level by the British in
1815 A.D.
The manner in which power was decentralized in Sri Lanka during
the British colonial era
The manner in which decentralization of power took place during the British
rule can be identified by the Municipal Councils Act 1865 A.D. In 1865 AD and in
1866 AD Municipal Councils were established based on Colombo and Kandy cities
respectively. British governance has immensely influenced the present situation in
Sri Lanka where decentralization of power has been established.
Village Councils (Gam Sabha) were established in 1871 AD. An ordinance
enacted in the same year assigned the Village Councils provisions to solve minor
disputes arising in villages, to solve the problems related to agriculture and
irrigation and provide health protection. An executive committee appointed for
local governance under the Donoughmore Constitutional reforms in 1931 extended
the powers of Village Councils (Gam Sabha). In addition, the establishment of
Urban Councils in 1940, and the Local Government Ordinance passed in 1943
further decentralized power in the British colonial era.
Attempts to decentralize power after independence
The existence of local government bodies could be noticed even after gaining
independence in 1948. The political authority system was established in 1973 to
decentralize power. This attempt of the United Front government was to provide
leadership for the enforcement of administration at district level. Subsequently,
District Minister system in 1980 established the District Development Council
abolishing the Village Councils and Town councils. Later, in 1981, Divisional
Councils (Pradeshiya Mandala) and Village Councils (Gramodaya Mandala) started
functioning and Pradeshiya Sabhas were created according to the Pradeshiya Sabha
Act, No 15 of 1987.

Attempts to devolve power in Sri Lanka
Opinions on devolution of power had been presented in our country
nearly a century ago. The proposal to establish a federal state in the upcountry
regions forwarded by Mr. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike in 1926 is prominent as an
effort to devolve power. The Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact signed between
Mr. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike and Mr. S.J.V. Chelvanayakam in 1957 and Dudley-
Chelvanayakam Pact in 1965 are examples of attempts to devolve power after
independence. But the enforcement of these pacts was not possible in the desired
manner.
In the recent past, in 1970’s and 1980’s, a tendency towards the process
of power devolution is noticed. However, the then governments did not intervene
directly and they were more inclined towards decentralization of power than
devolution of power.
Establishment of Provincial Councils in Sri Lanka
Provincial Councils were established by the 13th amendment to the
constitution of 1978 and the Act of Parliament No 42 of 1987 based on the 09
provinces prevailed. Chapter XVII A and Article 154A (1) of the 1978 constitution
states thus
“Subject to the provisions of the constitution, a Provincial Council shall be
established for every province specified in the eighth schedule with effect
from such date or dates as the president may appoint by order published in the
gazette. Different dates may be observed in respect of different provinces”
The 9 provinces which were established under the 13th Amendment to the
constitution are as follows.
The nine provinces established according to 8th schedule of the constitution
are given below

Governor of the Province
A Governor shall be there in each province and he is the delegate
co-ordinator of the Central Government and the Provincial Council. The appointment
of the Governor is done by the President and his tenure is 5 years. The Governor
can resign before the end of his term. A Governor can be removed by addressing a
proposal passed by a two- thirds majority of the Provincial Council to the President.
Article 154 B (1) and (2) of the constitution (1978) states about the Governor, thus;
‘There shall be a Governor for each province for which a Provincial
Council has been established in accordance with Article 154A’
The Governor shall be appointed by the President by warrant under his
hand, and shall hold office, in accordance with Article 4 (b), during the
pleasure of the President.

Chief Minister and the board of ministers
It is mentioned in the 1978 Constitution that Provincial Councils should
consist of a Chief Minister and a Board of Ministers selected from the members of
the Provincial Council. The main function of this Board of Ministers is to assist the
Governor in his functions and advise him. The Appointment of the Chief Minister is
one of the functions of the Governor and the person to be appointed should possess
the consent of the majority of members in the Provincial Council. The Governor
should appoint the rest of the ministers on the advice of the Chief Minister. The Chief
Minister and the Board of Ministers are collectively responsible and answerable to
the Provincial Council.
Powers and functions of the Chief Minister and the Board of
Ministers
² Render advice to the governor in the exercise of his functions
² Preparation of the provincial budget
² Drafting and executing economic development and administrative plans of
the Province
The Provincial Council
You are already aware that Provincial Councils were established in the 09
provinces of Sri Lanka. (Article) 154 (2) of the constitution states that Provincial
Councils will be constituted in each Provincial Council separately.
"Every Provincial Council established under paragraph (1) shall
be constituted upon the election of the members of such council in
accordance with the law relating to Provincial Council elections''.
Article 154D (1) of the constitution states the content of the provincial
legislature. Accordingly, taking the land area and the population of each province,

The term of office of a Provincial Council lasts for five years. If it is not
dissolved before the expiration of the said period, with the completion of five years,
it is considered as dissolved. Members of the Provincial Council are elected only
through Provincial Council elections.
The main function of the Provincial Council is to formulate and pass statutes
on matters determined under the list of powers of Provincial Councils stated in
the 9th schedule of the constitution. Similarly, passing the budget of the Provincial
Council, making decisions relevant to the development of infrastructural facilities
are implemented. The election of the Chief Minister and the Board of Ministers not
more than four, from among the Provincial Council members is also executed by
the legislature of each Provincial Council.
Powers and functions of Provincial Councils
Powers have been classified into three lists according to the 13th amendment to the
1978 Constitution.
v 1st List (Provincial Council list)
v 2nd List (Reserved list)
v 3rd List (Concurrent list)
Accordingly, functions and powers have been classified under three main
fields: central government, provincial council and concurrent powers which both
institutions can exercise. Next you can learn about the three lists and the powers
assigned to each of them as laid down.
List I (Provincial Council List/ Powers of Provincial Councils)
The Provincial Council list contains the functions and powers of Provincial
Councils. Functions and powers of 37 subjects that Provincial Councils are vested
with, are denoted in this list.
e.g:-
² Planning – implementation of provincial economic plans
² Affairs related to local government
² Provincial housing and construction: implementing housing development
programmes and projects
² Social services and rehabilitation
² Agricultural extension. Rehabilitation and maintenance of minor irrigation

Provincial Councils can pass statutes on these subjects, but significantly, a
Council cannot exercise any power in respect of any subject in the reserved list and
it cannot pass any statute in this regard. It has no power to initiate an act.
List II (Reserved list/Powers of Central Government)
Powers relevant to 17 subjects exercised by the central government are
denoted in List II or Reserved list. Subjects which are of great significance are
included in this Reserved list and the Parliament is vested with the sole power to
formulate law relevant to these subjects. Accordingly, several powers included in
List II are given below.
² Forming National policies on all subjects and functions
The power to make policies regarding defence and national security,
internal security, law and order.
² Foreign affairs
All matters related to the government of Sri Lanka with any foreign
country; Diplomatic affairs; United Nations Organization; participation
in international conferences, implementation of decisions taken there;
entering into treaties and agreements with foreign countries and
implementing treaties, war and peace; and foreign jurisdiction are covered
under this.
Justice in so far it relates to the judiciary and the structure of courts
² Finance in relation to national revenue, monetary policy and external resources
² Census and Statistics

List III (Concurrent List)
Powers that can be equally exercised by both Central Government and
Provincial Councils are classified under List III. It consists of 36 subjects. Some of
them are given below:

this General Assembly. Formulating of policies and plans, passing the council’s
budget, assisting the Mayor/Chairman in the execution of administrative functions
receive priority among the powers and functions of the General Assembly.

which consisted of 13 states. There was also the need to build a strong nation to
avoid the reoccurrence of the experience they had to face during the British colonial
regime.
Laws related to devolution of power had been included in the constitution
when the United States of America was formed in 1787. Accordingly, powers of the
Central Government were included in the constitution while the State Governments
were vested with the rest of the powers. The purpose was to strengthen the State
Governments.
The Structure of the Government of the United States of
America
² The executive President exercises the executive powers.
² The legislature consists of two houses: congress
(house of representatives) and the senate (bicameral
legislature)
² The president has to obtain the approval of the senate
to exercise certain powers.
Example - Declaration of war, appointment of
higher officers (ambassadors, judges of the higher
courts and signing international treaties)

-USA The map
of USA with the 13 states
² The Supreme Court is empowered to settle the disputes
between the Central Government and the states over
the execution of power.
² Appointment of two representatives to the senate to represent the interests of
each state.
² Existence of a federal judiciary.
If the acts approved by the congress are inconsistent with the constitution, the
Supreme Court has the power to reject them.
² Requirements of 2/3 of the consent of the Central Government and 3/4 of the
states for constitutional amendment.

of the United States of America
The constitution has vested all the powers except the powers given to the
Central Government in the states. It is understood that the makers of the constitution
have made an effort to build a system of federal states with more powers than the
Central Government. The powers of the Central Government and the states are
given below.

At present, there is a trend of the government succeeding in strength over
the states in the U.S.A. There are many underlying reasons and some of them are
mentioned below.
² The complexity of social, political and economic problems.

Establishment of the Swiss Confederation
Reasons behind the establishment of a federal state
The threat to the national security being sandwiched between four countries:
France, Italy, Germany and Austria.
² The difficulty to develop Switzerland economically due to its harsh
geographical differences.
² Need to achieve successful solutions to ethnic, language and religious
diversity.
The formation of the federal
state of Switzerland took place as a
result of the above reasons. Before
the formation of a federal state, there
was a number of small independent
states in the country. As a result of the
civil war between the Catholics and
the Protestants in mid 19th century the
federal state was formed and the war
was called off.
Switzerland stretches to an area
of 41300 square kilometers (km2)
and it comprises of communities
speaking languages such as German,
French, Italian and Romansh and
these languages are considered as the
official languages.

The constitution of Switzerland
was approved 150 years back. It has

the last time. There are 26 provincial governments known as cantons in the federal
system. It is a significant feature that freedom of a higher level has been awarded

The Multicultural Society
Introduction
The present day society is extremely complex. Economic, social,
political and cultural factors have contributed to this complexity. Apart from
these, geographical factors, migrations and invasions have also influenced
this tendency. Hence, modern society is comprised of differences like diverse
ethnic groups, languages, religions, beliefs, customs and manners. Social
systems with such diversity are termed plural societies by sociologists.
The different ethnic groups living in such plural societies practise customs,
manners, languages, religions, beliefs, aspirations, traditions etc., unique
to them in order to safeguard their identity. Owing to this, the culture of
even a single country can be diverse. Societies that comprise such cultures
are called "Multicultural Societies". This unit anticipates provision of a
correct understanding regarding multicultural societies and the creation of a
generation of citizens endowed with the competencies necessary to contribute
to the building of the atmosphere essential for peaceful co-existence in such a
society.
The Multicultural Society
Various sociologists and philosophers have put forward definitions to
explain what "Culture" means. Given below are a few of them;
Culture is the knowledge, beliefs, arts, habits, values and the behaviours,
pro-activities and abilities acquired by man as an individual living in
society.
T.B. Tyler
Culture is the collective name that can be given to all behaviour patterns
required socially, by means of symbols or inheritance.
Charles A. Elwood
For free distribution
Culture means the socially as well as traditionally accepted forms of
implementation of beliefs, styles of thought, applied arts, life styles,
customs and manners.
E.T. Healar
From the above definitions, it is evident that all our activities and thoughts
and desires belong to the category of culture. All of us have got habituated to an
accepted life style within society. This habituation or moulding is also culture. As
an individual, each of us from birth to death behave according to the culture we
have inherited. All the features that manipulate the forces evident in society belong
to culture. Some of them are given below;
Language
Knowledge
² Religion
² Clothes
² Food and Drink
² Arts
² Rules and
regulations
² Faiths
² Customs
² Ethics
² Values
² Family background
² Economic background
² Beliefs
² Equipment used
² Friends associated with
² Education
² Politics
² Technology
² Habitat
Infrastructure
In every society an important function or role is performed by culture for the
existence of that society. Culture continues to change and develops within society,
with the time.
Culture varies in terms of society in which the individual lives. As a result, in
different societies, a culture that is unique to that society develops.

Emergence of a multicultural society and the necessity of
good governance
Introduction of good governance
Good Governance can be defined as a concept that emerged consequent to
the factors that influenced the collapse of social justice as well as the lethargy in
the economic development of certain countries where there was no lack of either
economic or human resources.
For free distribution Given below are some of the reasons as to why economic development has
become lethargic as a result of the failure of the economic and human resources of
these countries to be properly managed.
Inefficiency of governance
Politicization of public services
² Power becoming unnecessarily centralized
² Bureaucratic control
Absence of public participation in deciding on state policy and its
implementation
Escalation of bribery and corruption
State administrators becoming irresponsible.
² Negligence of national goals by the private sector
While emphasizing the necessity of alleviating the above weaknesses faced
by most countries, the concept of good governance is one possible solution put
forward in that regard.
Good Governance is a process of deciding on government policies and
implementing them. The responsibility of those who govern is to be accountable for
the well-being of citizens to the maximum, protecting civil rights and social justice
by being law abiding and having transparency without corruption and malpractices
Basic Qualities of Good Governance
1' State control and administration free of corruption and fraud
2' Confirmation of freedom and equity
3' Respecting the supremacy of law and safeguarding the independence of the
judiciary
4' Individuals responsible for the implementation of state control being
accountable to the public
5' Safeguarding and confirming rights
6' Safeguarding media freedom
7' Making use of resources efficiently and productively
8' Acting with transparency

Importance of respecting political, socio-economic and cultural
identity of each other for good governance
For good governance, respecting political, socio-economic and cultural
identity of each other is an essential requirement. It is essential to confirm the above
qualities in society for this purpose.
Furthermore, paying attention to the following requirements is important'
Political
² Respecting the political identity of each other
² Following any political ideology of one's choice
² Respecting political leadership
² Acting independently when taking political decisions and conclusions
Ensure that such decisions are not obstructive to others
² Conducting free and fair elections

² Following customs and manners
Holding various celebrations
² Residing in a region of one's choice
² Travelling freely
² Respecting cultures of others

² broaden understanding between each other
² develops participation of all ethnic groups for administrative purposes

acts promoting transparency
Multicultural Society and the Morden States
The modern idea of a national government is one Government for a single
nation. This implies that a state is one nation. Even though people who belong to
different cultures live in a country, they are considered as a single nation.
For example, although Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims and other races as well as
people of different cultures live in Sri Lanka, they have to be treated as Sri Lankans.
Modern states where democratic governance is implemented endeavour
to integrate diversities and march towards development independently while
respecting the diverse cultural identities.
Most of the developed countries have immensely made use of multi-
culturalism in their economic, social and political process. Their theme is ''Unity
in Diversity.'' Countries like Singapore and Switzerland can be cited as examples.

Economic Systems and Economic
Relations
Through the study of this chapter you will acquire the ability to
investigate basic economic problems and economic activities,
explore information about various economic systems,
analyse the present economic systems in relation to development,
analyse the influence of globalization on Sri Lanka.
4.1. Basic economic problems and economic activities
Man is subject to various needs and wants when living in a social system.
When attempting to satisfy these wants, man has to face various problems. The
manner in which each society acts in attempting to resolve these problems is
different.
The manner in which societies are organized in order to solve the basic
economic problems faced by man is termed an economic system.
You may already be aware of various needs and wants arising when living
as a group in a society. Primary essentials for man’s existence are called needs.
Clothes, housing, food, etc., are examples of needs. They are explained as basic
needs.
The above needs are fulfilled by various persons in different ways. Various
forms of wants are called needs. Although housing is a basic need, in the fulfilment
of this need houses are constructed in various forms such as huts, wattle and daub
houses, large houses, condominiums, etc. From the example above, it is clear that
they are diverse according to the socio-economic condition of the individual in
need.
We know that the wants of individuals are different as much as they are
unlimited. But we are also aware that resources for the satisfaction of these wants are
limited. Although we need to build a large house, problems arise when we attempt
to build it based on requirements such as the land available, finances etc. Therefore,
if this unlimited necessity is to be met, with the resources available, it becomes
necessary to function in the context of a systematic and scientific methodology.

Display on a table human needs and the wants relevant to them.
Basic Economic Problems
We learned earlier that we have to face various problems in endeavouring
to satisfy human needs and wants. These problems are common to any economic
system. Boundless needs and wants of man and limited resources available to satisfy
them, give rise to these problems. We call this a shortage. Because of shortage,
selection has to be done when fulfilling wants. Problems that any economic system
has to face are called basic economic problems. They can be divided to three main
categories.
1. Which, how much of it is to be produced?
It becomes necessary to decide as to which good is to be produced utilizing
the resources available. And also, the problem arises as to how much of the selected
articles are to be produced. The primary reason for this problem is the availability
of a number of alternative uses of the resources.

decisions that can be taken in this
regard. It is according to the manner in
which the economy is organized that a
decision, as to ‘what’ "how many items
of each are to be produced," can be
taken.
Fig 4.1
2. How is it produced?
After solving the problem as to how many units of the goods are to be
produced the next economic problem to be faced is regarding how they are to be
produced. In this regard two sub – problems need to be faced. They are,
i What is the technique to be applied?
ii By which section is the production to be made?
for free distribution
i. What is the technique to be applied?
There are two main techniques employed in production.
² Capital Intensive
Capital Intensive is the utilization of machinery and other capital equipment
extensively for the production of goods. e.g: If machinery is used for agriculture
extensively it is called capital intensive agriculture.
² Labour Intensive
Labour intensive is the extensive employment of humans in the production
of goods. e.g: If a large labour force is used in agriculture it is labour intensive
agriculture
ii. Which section does the production?
Deciding as to which sector does the production. There are three sectors
where production takes place. As to how production is carried out is of secondary
importance.
State sector
Mineral oil production
² State sector education
² Railway service
Production
of goods and
services
Private sector
² Production of garments
² Private sector education
State and
private sectors
combined
² Telephone services carried
out jointly by the state and
private sector
² Construction of roadways
Various types of business entities such as sole traders, corporations,
partnerships, cooperatives have been formed in order to facilitate the production in
the modern world.
iii. For whom is it produced?
Deciding about for whom goods and services are produced is meant by this.
Society is made up of various groups, in terms of capability to purchase. In this
instance it is important as to which of these groups is targeted when producing.
for free distribution
That is, deciding on the consumers among whom the goods and services are
to be distributed. Luxury goods which derive a high profit are to be produced for
people receiving high incomes? Or otherwise, are essential goods to be produced
for those receiving low incomes? Decision taken in this regard can be noted as
examples.
Activity 4.1
Imagine that you own a block of bare land bordering a trunk road.
Should you intend to use this land for economic activities? Describe
your decision in the light of the economic question above.
Production factors and payments for them
In the satisfaction of human needs, various goods and services are made use
of. These goods are of two main types,
² Economic goods – Goods that bear a cost in production and involve payment
of a price for use thereof
e.g. The features above can be seen in food, clothes, medicine etc.
² Non-economic goods – Goods that are provided free to us by nature,
e.g. Sunlight; water, air.
There are instances where non – economic goods, goods provided free
to us, at times become economic goods.
i. Although we get water free of charge, we have to pay for bottled water.
ii. We have to pay for sunlight converted to electricity
iii. A price has to be paid for nitrogen stored and used in vehicles.
for free distribution
1. Land
The earth and all resources related to the
earth belong to land. The payment made
for this use in the production process is
known as rent.
Fig 4.2
2. Labour
Fig 4.3
The physical and mental energy spent by
various individuals in the production of goods
and services is called labour. Since labourers,
farmers, drivers, etc., spend comparatively
more physical energy, it is called physical
labour. As doctors, engineers, teachers, etc.,
spend comparatively more mental energy, it is
called mental labour. Payment that is done for
labour is called wages.
3. Capital
The various equipment and machinery on which
man invests for the purpose of production are
capital. Machinery, buildings etc., are considered
as capital. Payment made with respect to capital
is called interest.
Fig 4.4
4. Entrepreneurship
Production factors are not located in one single
place. They lie scattered in different places and
among different individuals. The task of labouring
to bring together the production factors distributed
for the expand production process is called
entrepreneurship. Payment made for this is called
profits or profit.

2.Distribution
Distribution is the process of delivering the produced goods to the consumer.
In the past, since one person produced the goods required by one's own self, there
was no exchange of goods involved. Afterwards, a system of exchange of one type
of goods for another type of goods came into being. For example, in the production
of paddy, one's excess production was given to another and salt, dry fish, clothes
etc., were received in exchange. At present, goods came to be exchanged, through
the market with money as the medium. This process is called trade. Trade takes
place not only in the interior of a country, but also internationally. Trade can be
divided into two main types.
for free distribution
² Wholesale Trade
Wholesale trade is the process by
which the goods produced are supplied to
intermediate traders in large stocks, instead
of the final consumer. Wholesale trade
takes place between the producer and the
wholesale trader and the wholesale trader
and the retail trader.
² Retail Trade
Retail trade is the provision of goods
obtained from the producer or the wholesale
trader to the consumer. The retail trader is
the last person met, when goods flow from
the producer to the customer.
Fig 4.9
Fig 4.10
3. Consumption
Consumption is the fulfillment of human needs and wants using the goods
and services produced by an economy. The individual who fulfills his needs in this
manner is called a consumer. The goods that directly contribute to the fulfillment of
the needs and wants of the individual are called consumer goods. The utilization of
food, drink, clothes, vehicles in the fulfilment of one's needs, are examples.

Exploring information on various economic systems
An economic system shows how various organizations deal with the solution
of basic economic problems as to what man faces, to what extent, what manner and
for whom it is produced. This is called an economic system.
These economic systems are basically divided into three main parts.
1. Capitalist systems
2. Socialist systems
3. Mixed systems
The capitalist economic system
An economic organization where property, mostly owned by the private
sector handled with the intention of profit making is called a capitalist economy
system. Given below are a few basic qualities of such an economy;
² Existence of a competitive market
² Ownership of production factors owned by the private sector
² Unequal distribution of profits
Production being profit oriented
In capitalist economic systems an effort is made to attract customers to one's
product and retain them through massive publicity campaigns, is quite evident.
However, the consumer has the liberty to purchase products of his choice out of the
goods available in the market.
Examples of countries where capitalist economic systems prevail are the
United States of America, Great Britain, Japan and Australia. However, total
capitalist economic systems cannot be seen in the world, where some properties are
controlled by the state sector.
Socialist Economic Systems
Economic organizations in which a central planning board is functioning to
solve basic economic problems and the property is under common ownership are
called a Socialist Economic System. Socialist Economic Systems are also called
planned economic systems or state enterprise economic systems.
for free distribution
Given below are a few basic qualities of such an economy;
² Property is state – owned
² The economy is handled by a central planning board
In the solution of basic economic problems, the focus is on the common good
North Korea and Cuba can be cited as examples of countries where socialist
economic systems exist. It is evident that the existing socialist economic systems
are undergoing changes.
Mixed Economic Systems
Mixed economic systems contain the features of both capitalist and socialist
economic systems. Such economic systems are seen in most of the countries in
the world. Sri Lanka is also considered a country with a mixed economic system.
Following are some features of a mixed economic system'
Ownership of factors of production devolved on both state and private
sectors.
² Both the state and private sectors take action in the solution of basic economic
problems.
² Although the price of commodities depends on the market, there is state
intervention.
Existence of both private and state sector enterprise'

The Market Economy which operates at present is also called Neo
– Liberal Economic system. Under this, while the state does not implement what
the private sector can implement, there is scope for the market to function under
minimum state intervention.

Countries like Russia, Poland, China, where a Socialist Economic system
prevailed are gradually implementing the concept of Market Economy at present.
Given below are several characteristics of the Neo – Liberal Market
Economy implemented at present.

Adverse features also can be identified within the concept of the market
economy. Among them is the tendency for the damage caused to other parties,
in a market economy, to be ignored. This is called negative externalities. Eg:
Environmental pollution in the location of factories, failure to recognize public
nuisance etc.
Different forms of the Market Economy
When inquiring about countries where a Market Economic System prevails
three main forms are evident.
i. Greater evidence of characteristics of a capitalist market.
e.g( United States of America, Australia, Singapore, South Korea
ii. Greater evidence of characteristics of a socialist market.
e.g ( North Korea, Cuba
iii. Economies that are in the process of moving towards a transformation
economy or market economy e.g; Countries like Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus,
Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Russia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan
that belonged to USSR (The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics).

Influence of Globalization on Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka is a country with a long history. When examining the economic
systems that existed from the past to the present day it is clear that Sri Lanka's
economy existed in various forms. These economic policies changed from time to
time based on the government that controlled the state. After winning freedom from
British rule in 1948, it is evident that economic systems with socialist, capitalist and
mixed economic features, had existed.

Current economic system of Sri Lanka and Development
The economic system that prevails in Sri Lanka is based on the open economic
policy which is a market friendly economy. Even though it possessed features of
Socialism prior to 1977, at present it contains features of a market economy.
Under the policy of open economy after 1977, private enterprises are
encouraged through various strategies introduced to the economy.
² Provision of various tax concessions to private investors
² Removal of trade barriers (customs duty)
² Minimization of state intervention in the market
² Encouragement of foreign investment
² Privatization of state - property
² Fluctuation of exchange rates
Introduction of an import export economy
Opening up of state institutions to the competitive market
² Broadening infrastructural facilities
² Establishment of Free Trade Zones.
It was stated earlier that Sri Lanka too reflects qualities of a Market Economy.
Given below are a few of such characteristics.
Encouragement of the private sector
State distancing itself from enterprises
Privatization of state enterprises

Introduction to Development
In an economic system, development or growth of various forms can be
seen. While some are beneficial to man some have an adverse effect. For example,
growth of crime, an increasing number of accidents, can be shown as adverse
developments. Accordingly, development that is of a beneficial nature to society is
described with the term development in Economics.
Economic growth and development are not the same. Economic growth is
the percentage of growth in the gross national production annually. But development
is wider and it implies the growth of economic, political, social and humanistic
sectors favourable to society.
Some interpretations presented on ‘Development are’:
“Progress in economic, political, social and humanity sectors and
the minimization of poverty along with permanent progress, is
development.”
- United Nations Development Report, 2000 -
“The economic and social transformation process taking place through
the interaction between complex cultural and environmental factors,
is development.”
- (www.business dictionary. Com. 2013.08.12) -
It is about sustainable development that much of present – day discussion
is focussed on. Sustainable development implies ensuring the security of the
resources of the economy for future generations while satisfying current needs
with the passage towards development.
It is difficult to give a definite definition to development. This concept
implies complete personal and social development. In this regard there are several
aspects that should be taken into consideration.

Describe the importance of sustainable development.
At the millennium assembly of the United Nations Organization in 2000 on
development, eight Millennium Development Targets were approved.
They are,
1' Eradication of poverty and hunger
2' Acquisition of a common primary education
3' Empowerment of women and gender equality
4' Proportional reduction of infant deaths
5' Development of mental health
6' Suppression of diseases like AIDS and Malaria
7' Assurance of environmental sustainability
8' Initiation of a global relationship for development
Sri Lanka too has accepted in principle the need to move towards development
through the achievement of the targets outlined above. It has been accepted as a
policy at present to make Sri Lanka as the central point of knowledge in Asia
New development trends in present - day Sri Lanka
In the past the economy of Sri Lanka depended on subsistence agriculture.
But with Sri Lanka coming under British rule its economy was gradually transformed
into an import - export economy based on plantation crops. Before 1977, state
contribution in the areas of agriculture, industry and services was visibly dominant.
Attention was also paid to the setting up of export oriented industries utilizing local
resources.
When inquiring into modern development trends in Sri Lanka, it is possible
to divide the changes that took place after independence into several main stages.
The table below shows the special features evident in each period;

The influence of technological development and globalization
on world economy and Sri Lankan economy
Technological progress and globalization
People who lived in isolation tended to make various discoveries by living
as a group. With the new industrial revival of Europe new technology too developed
gradually. Every sector in the world has been connected based on this scientific and
technological progress. This is called a Global Village or Globalization.
Fig 4.12 - Several modern technological equipment
The picture above shows several products that have been created using
modern technology. It can be seen that the technological equipment are spread across
all sections of industry, communication, trade, education, health and transport.
Along with the progress of communication technology that takes place
in countries of the world, the whole world has drawn closer to each other. Thus
we can know of any event that occurs anywhere in the world in a moment. The
world drawing closer in this manner with technology is generally known as
globalization.
for free distribution
The mutual relationship taking place within the economic, political and
cultural processes is called globalization. The world economy becoming a single
unit can also be expressed as Globalization. Thus economic changes of one country
exert influence on other countries.
Given below are several characteristics of globalization.
² Broadening of the world of work
² Broadening of the global market
² Ability to live in any country in the world
² The possibility of working in any country in the world according to one's
skills and abilities
² Transfer of industries to countries where cheap labour is available
Just as much as economic reasons, political, social and cultural reasons
too influenced the spread of globalization. Developed countries use this concept
to politically influence other countries. e.g: Market control, impose sanctions
etc. Various forms of cultural intermixing take place as a result of globalization.
Similarly, world powers have utilized globalization to impose their domination in
the world market. It is also possible that a form of neo – colonialism would spread
owing to globalization.
Activity
² Collect information on globalization.
The influence of globalization on the world economy
International trade has been subject to various changes within globalization.
The view of the European Union is that the entire world should be transformed into
a single nation speaking the same language and using the same monetary unit. One
example of this is the action taken by the European Union to introduce a common
currency unit within its zone.
As stated earlier the endeavour of world powers was the transformation of the
entire world to a single economic unit within globalization. Various organizations
such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, United Nations Organization,
Asian Development Bank and World Trade Organization have been set up to
promote this effort. However the effort made through these institutions have directly
or indirectly influenced other countries.

How globalization influences Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka too is unable to save itself from Globalization. We have to bear the
influence of Globalization. As a result of the Open Economic policy implemented
after 1977 the influence of globalization has become more and more pronounced.
The reason for this is the exposure of production and trade to the world market.
Given below are several positive and negative influences Sri Lanka has had
to face on account of globalization.

Conflict Resolution in a
Democratic Society
Dispute is a term often heard and often spoken in daily usage. It is
prevalent in every society. It is the result of diversity. Diversity in human is
expressed through disputes. Variety of individual aims needs and aspirations
create conflicts. Diversity is based on language, caste, religion and territories.
Consequently, conflicts among individuals, individuals and states, states and
states occur.
Disputes bring about both destructive and constructive results. In the
process of social development, conflicts can be taken as a constructive and a
creative force. For example, an unresolved problem or a series of problems is
given expression in this manner.
Individual’s mind which leads to conflict
A conflict originates due to dissent in the mind of an individual. As a result,
the individual is inclined to uncommon behaviour like unrest, tension, sudden
anger, intolerance, use of harsh language, unruly behaviour or assault. Unless such
conflicting mental conditions are settled soon and if continued it can end in mental
illness.
Individuals who evince such behaviour can cause disputes within the family,
between families, in the society and within institutions. As it is detrimental to the
individual and society, a solution should be sought at the beginning. Since the
conflict occurs as a result of the mindset of the individual, the elimination or the
minimisation of a conflict can bring about mental peace.
For free distribution Directions to create mental peace
² Turn to religious activities
² Engage in psychological exercises
² Counselling
² Through observation of natural environment
Basic reasons for conflicts
The triangular struggle conflicts model of Joban Galtun is useful to study
about conflicts.
Context
Attitudes
Behaviour
The context here is the background to the conflict. Conflicts occur with the
connections based on the desires of the relevant parties. Hence the context explains
the social, economic and political environment responsible for the conflict.
Attitudes are the psychological factors on which conflicts develop. It
is due to true or wrong beliefs of both the parties. Violent conflicts are caused
by misconceptions among participants. Mental states such as fear, suspicion,
disappointment and hatred do occur in minds. The final result is the conflict due to
aggressive attitudes.
Behaviour related to conflicts is multifaced. It can be helpful or forceful.
Forceful behaviour can be aggressive or destructive.

For free distribution Internal Conflicts
Personal and social conflicts among the people of a country can be categorised
as internal conflicts. These can be categorised as universal and intricate conflicts.
For example, the conflicts which are of national level or wider level can be called
universal conflicts. The conflicts among communities, religions, and national trade
unions can be cited as examples. Examples of intricate conflicts are the mental
conflicts caused in an individual due to disappointment, family conflicts, economic
problems, domestic violence and land disputes.
Not only individual level reasons but national level reasons also affect these
conflicts. It is obvious that individual conflicts cannot be solved without solving
national level conflicts and vice versa. In solving conflicts, individual and national
level relations have to be taken into serious consideration.
International Conflicts
Conflicts between countries are called international conflicts. They are of two kinds.
² Conflicts of opinions
² Military conflicts
Political, social and economic differences create differences of opinion and they
are called conflicts of opinions. The conceptual conflict of capitalist and socialist
camps, western and eastern cultures and Christian countries of the west and the
middle eastern Islamic countries can be cited as examples.
Resources, economic benefits and expansion of powers are the reasons
behind international conflicts.
The final outcome of an international conflict is war. This situation is to be
seen at global and territorial level and between countries. The 1st and 2nd world
wars were extremely gruesome. Millions of human lives were destroyed and the
loss of property and environmental damage was terrible.

Methods of conflict resolution
The resentment and contradictory ideas of individuals primarily create
disputes. Such situations can be settled at the outset, avoiding conflict. For this
individuals and various parties can follow many methods.
Democratic action can be cited as the best method in conflict resolution.
Taking decisions, listening to the voice of both parties is meant by this. This is
important in the case of an individual, family, nation or international area as well.
Being insensitive to a conflict of opinion which exists in an individual or
among a group of people can lead to a dispute. By ensuring a good communication
with the relevant parties the eruption of violence can be prevented.
Conflict resolution is important because the results of conflicts can be
unhealthy for the individual as well as society. Conflicts in society appear in different
shapes and levels. Understanding the present situation of a conflict is of paramount
importance in conflict resolution. As such, various suitable methods need to be
studied. The important methods which can be used are discussion, bargaining and
conciliation, mediation, peaceful settlement, arbitration, inquiry and counselling.
Discussion
The basic methods of conflict resolution is discussion. The parties who were
instrumental in the conflict find a resolution after coming to a table directly or
by way of third party discussions. The parties succeed in coming to "win- win"
situations.
Aspects of discussion

Bargaining and amicable settlement
This method is in use to solve democratically the problems that arise
between employee and employer. The related parties come to a resolution on their
demands. In this process the parties demonstrate their opposition whenever they
disagree. Ultimately both the parties agree on certain decisions considering their
demands and resolve the conflicts.
In industrial conflicts, estate labour conflicts, trade unions, discussion
and bargaining methods are used.
Aspects of bargaining
² A team work
² Existence of (employer - employee) both parties
² Discussion at the discussion table
² Mutual agreement
² Formal process
² Related to service conditions and wages
² Bargaining commences from demands
² Bargaining ends in an agreement

Mediation
Mediation is used in helping two persons to communicate or two countries
to settle a dispute when the discussion method has failed. This is a mediation sans
war. Professional mediators, specialists in conflict resolution, the relevant parties
of the conflict and external parties can be used as mediators.
Facts to be considered when selecting a mediator
² An unbiased individual accepted by both parties
² Who has a thorough knowledge of the conflict
² A person who does not force his own decisions and solutions on the parties
² Who directs parties towards a solution acceptable to both parties
² Meets both parties separately in instances where they cannot meet directly
Who does not influence either party
and communicate between both parties

Conciliation
Conciliation is the intervention or mediation in a conflict or disagreement. It
is not the final settlement. Conciliator may be an individual or a group. It is meant
to settle disputes by discussing with the opposite sides. Conciliation is useful when
both parties are in neither win nor lose positions. The conciliator may take part to
settle the dispute on a request by one of the parties or someone else.
Role of the conciliator
Induce the opposite parties to a discussion
² Take the initiative to explain the underlying reasons for the conflict
² Raise a direct or indirect discussion regarding the reasons of the conflict
² Try to reduce the gap and the differences between the opposite parties
² Suggest a programme to enter into agreements
The Conciliatory Council has been established as a legal entity by the
Ministry of Justice to conciliate. It directs settlement of conflicting situations, minor
offences, family disputes before taking them to courts. Many such conciliatory
councils have been established at regional level.

Arbitration
Arbitration is the process which is useful in settling a dispute by a mediator
with the consent of the parties. The special person who is selected for the purpose
is the arbitrator. The arbitrator listens to the problems and questions and finally the
correct party is explained. Although both parties are supposed to find solutions, the
outstanding feature is the win - lose situation.

Inquiry
Inquiry is the traditional method of conflict resolution. A court of law or a
parallel body advises the relevant parties to the conflict to come to a settlement
at first and if it fails the dispute is settled by legal inquiry. The verdict of the
judiciary is final and the loser can appeal to a higher court of law.
Aspects of Inquiry
² Both parties cannot refrain from
coming to the discussion
² The defendant should appear in
court
² Giving evidence, legal inquiry is
formal
² Both parties have freedom to give
evidence, argue and cross examine
² Verdict is given according to the law

Building a compromise
Both parties of the conflict are brought to a compromise by a third party in
this process. Both parties sign an agreement to certify the settlement of the dispute
and control instances of conflicts. The particular feature is the contribution of a
third party to observe the implementation of the agreement.
Chances of settling disputes by compromise
² Family disputes
² Employer - Employee disputes
² Disputes with neighbours
² Disputes between institutions
² Disputes among peers
