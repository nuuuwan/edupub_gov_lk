After studying this chapter, you will understand the following:
² How to analyze a problem and develop an algorithm
² Control structures and their use
² Drawing flow charts, writing pseudo codes and conversions between them
² Finding alternate solutions to a problem
² Programming in Pascal
² Evolution of programming languages
1.1 Analyzing a problem
The raw materials that are used to solve a problem are known as the 'input'.
The result obtained after solving a problem is known as the 'output'. Converting
input to output is called the 'process'. A process takes place step by step and it is
very important to understand the order of the process. When analyzing a problem,
the input, process and output are identified separately.
Example -
Problem 1 :
Preparing a letter which can be posted.
Input :
Process :
A sheet of paper suitable to write the letter on and a pen
An envelope and a stamp
1. Writing the letter
2. Folding the letter and putting it into
the envelope
3. Pasting the envelope
4. Writing the recipient's address on the
envelope
5. Sticking the stamp
Output :
A letter ready to be posted.
Note:
Steps No. 4 and 5 in this process can be interchanged.
However, the other steps should be followed in the order
indicated.

Problem 2 : Making a cup of tea
Input :
Tea leaves, sugar, hot water
Process :
1. Putting tea leaves in the strainer
2. Pouring hot water to the cup through
the strainer
3. Adding some sugar to the cup
4. Stirring it well with a spoon
5. Testing for taste, taking a small sip from the cup
6. If the taste is not satisfactory, go to step 3 and repeat step
Nos. 4 and 5
Output :
A cup of tea
Problem 3 :
Dividing 40 page and 80 page books from a parcel of
books between two siblings - Sanduni and Anupama.
Input :
The parcel of books
Process :
1. Opening the book parcel
2. Taking a book out from the parcel
3. If it is a 40 page book, giving it to
Sanduni
4. If it is a 80 page book, giving it to
Anupama
5. Go to Step No. 2 till all the books are taken out of the
parcel
Output :
Sanduni getting 40 page books
Anupama getting 80 page books

Activity
1. Identify the input, process and output related to dividing 100 toffees
among 20 people.
2. Identify the input, process and output in making a kite.
What are alternative solutions?
If there is more than one solution to a given problem, such solutions are
called alternative solutions. Such solutions depend on the nature of the problem.
For free distribution
Example
Imagine you come to school by school bus. If the bus breaks down on your way to
school, you certainly will think of other alternative ways to reach school. Thus, you
will think of alternative solutions to reach school.
1. Coming to school by another school bus which goes to your school
If you have money, reaching the school by CTB or private bus
3. Walking to school along the road
4. Walking to school using a short-cut
If you have a way to inform your parents, get their support to reach the
school
6. Reaching the school by car or motor bike with the support of a trustworthy
person
You may select a good solution out of these if it is mandatory to go to school that
Thus, if there are many solutions (set) to a particular problem, it is suitable to
consider these and select an appropriate solution.
All the solutions pertaining to a problem are called solution space. In computer
programming also, various solutions should be identified and an appropriate
solution should be selected. Then, we can create a short, simple program.
Example 1
Let us examine the solution space to find the perimeter of a rectangle.
Let us analyze the input, process and output related to this problem.
Input : Length and width of the rectangle
Process : Calculating the perimeter
Output : Indicating the perimeter
Let us examine the solution space to calculate the perimeter.
1st solution
Perimeter = length + width + length + width
2nd solution
Perimeter = length × 2 + width × 2
3rd solution
Perimeter = (length + width) × 2
Out of these solutions, a person who has knowledge only of addition, can select the
1st solution as the most appropriate. A person who has knowledge of multiplication
and addition can select the 3rd solution out of the 2nd and 3rd solutions as the most
appropriate. The reason for this is, it has the minimum number of additions and
multiplications.
For free distribution
Example 2
Indicating that a student has failed if the score for the ICT Subject is less than 35,
and indicating pass if the score is 35 or above.
Input : Marks
Process : Comparing the mark scored with 35
Solution 1.
If the mark is less than 35
Result = Fail
If not
Result = Pass
Solution 2.
If the mark is 35 or more than 35
Result = Pass
If not
Result = Fail
Output : Fail or Pass
Example 3
Finding the larger number from the given two numbers (See problem 6 in page 3)
Let us consider the two input numbers as n1 and n2.
Solution 1.
If n1 is larger than n2, the larger number will be n1.
If n2 is larger than n1, the larger number will be n2.
Solution 2. Subtract n2 from n1.
If the result is more than 0, n1 is the larger number.
If the result is less than 0, n2 is the larger number.
Thus, it is important to select the appropriate solution out of the available alternative
solutions.

1.2 Problem Solving using Algorithms
An algorithm is a method to show the steps in solving a problem. An
algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem. The need for this is to
present a way to solve the problem with a plan.
Example 1 - Let us develop an algorithm to post a letter.
(1) Writing the letter
(2) Folding the letter
(3) Inserting the letter in an envelope
(4) Writing the address
(5) Sticking the stamp
(6) Posting the letter
Step (1), (2) and (3) in this algorithm should be followed in the given order.
Step (4) and (5) can be interchanged. The reason for this is, you can either stick the
stamp after writing the address or write the address after sticking the stamp.
Thus, there are steps in an algorithm which should be followed in a strict
sequential order. Sometimes, if the order of some steps is changed, it does not affect
the process and the output is same.
Example 2 - Let us consider steps in measuring 500g of sugar using a scale.
(1) Putting sugar into a bag
(2) Placing the bag on the scale and getting the reading on the
scale
(3) If the weight of the sugar is less than 500g, add sugar till
it weighs 500g
(4) If the weight of the sugar is more than 500g, remove sugar
from the bag till it weighs 500g
(5) Remove the bag of sugar from the scale when the weight
is 500g
The algorithm to measure 500g sugar is given above.
Activity
There are 183 students in a primary school. The principal has
decided to hold an inter-house sports meet dividing them into three
houses – Olu, Nelum and Manel. Develop an algorithm to the divide
the students into the three houses.

1.2.1 Control Structures
Three types of control structures are used in an algorithms.
i. Sequence
ii. Selection
iii. Repetition
i. Sequence
If the steps from the beginning to the end of an algorithm are carried out in
a strict order, it is called a sequence.
Example -
1. Climbing up or down step by step when going on a staircase
2. Students who were admitted to grade 1 of the school
continue studies till grade 13
Activity
Write down two incidents which consist of sequences.
ii. Selection
Selection is a situation where step(s) are executed depending on whether a
condition of an algorithm is satisfied or not. There are two choices; if the condition
is satisfied, one is selected and if it is not satisfied, the other selection is selected.
For free distribution
Examples of selection
1. Admitting a child to Grade 1:
If a child is below 5 years as at 31st of
January that year
The child cannot be admitted to school
If not
The child can be admitted to school
2. Passing a subject:
If the mark is 35 or more
It is a Pass
If not
It is a Fail
3. Buying a book:
If you have money equal to or more than
the price of the book
You can buy the book
If not
You cannot buy the book
Activity
1. Write down three incidents which consist of selection.
2. If a Sri Lankan citizen gets the right to vote after completing the age
of 18, select the most suitable word for the blanks given below.
If the age is ……………… (more/less) than 18
The vote ……………… (can/cannot ) be casted
If not,
The vote …………… (can/cannot) be casted
iii. Repetition
If one or several steps of an algorithm are repeated until a condition is
satisfied, it is called repetition.
For free distribution
Examples
1. Let us consider the process of a class teacher
marking the attendance register.
(1) Call the first name on the register
(2) Mark 1 if the student is present
(3) Mark 0 if the student is absent
(4) Call the name of the next student
(5) Repeat step (2) or (3) and (4) till the
last name of the register is called
2. Let us consider the process of reading a paragraph
and calculating the number of words you read.
(1) Read the first word of the paragraph
(2) Number of words = 1
(3) Read the next word
(4) Add 1 to the number of words
(5) Repeat step (3) and (4) till the end of the paragraph
(6) After reading the paragraph, indicate the number of words
Activity
1. Write down as steps, two scenario that comprise repetition.
2. Fill in the blanks below related to repetition that output 5
times from 5 to 60.
I. n = 5
II. Output the value of n.
III. Add 5 to the value of n.
IV. Repeat step number ……… and ……….. till the value
of n = 60.
1.3 Representation of an algorithm
Flow charts and pseudo codes are used as tools to present an algorithm to
make the algorithm understand better.
For free distribution
1.3.1 Flowcharts
Flowcharts are used to present how the algorithm is built step by step in a
dramatic manner. The symbols given in table are used to indicate different functions.
(See Table 1.1)
Symbol
Table 1.1
Function
Start or end
Input or output
Process
Decision
Flow direction
Connector
Sequence
In sequence the steps from the beginning to the end are executed in order.
E.g. 1 - Finding the area of a circle.
Start
Input the radius of the circle
Calculate the area of the circle
Output the area of the circle
For free distribution
Selection
The selection indicates the flow of direction depending on a condition being
satisfied or not.
E.g. - Finding whether a number is odd or even
Start
Input the number
Find the remainder when the
number is divided by 2
Is the remainder 0?
An odd num ber
An even number
Repetition
A step or several steps are repeated till a condition is satisfied or are
continued till it is satisfied.
E.g. - Finding the total of some numbers
Start
Total = 0
Get the number N
Total = Total + N
Are there any more
numbers?
Output the Total
For free distribution
Activity
Draw flow charts to solve the problems given below.
1. Find the perimeter and area of a rectangle.
It is decided to add Rs.5000 to the basic salary of the employees of
a company. Calculate the new salary.
3. When posting a letter, postal fare is charged according to its weight.
The standard fare should be paid for letters which are equal to or
less than the standard weight. An additional fare should be charged
if the weight is more than the standard weight.
Indicate the first 12 multiples of 7.
5. Draw flow charts for the examples in selection 1:2:1.
1.3.2 Pseudo codes
When an algorithm is presented in simple English terms it is called a pseudo
code. Pseudo codes are independent of a computer language. Pseudo codes can be
converted to any programming language instructions. Hence, pseudo codes make
computer programming easier.
Let us see simple English terms used in an pseudo code.
BEGIN - To indicate a beginning
END - To indicate an end
INPUT , READ , GET - To indicate an input
OUTPUT, DISPLAY , SHOW - To show an output
PROCESS, CALCULATE - To indicate a process
IF … THEN .. .ELSE … ENDIF - Used to indicate a selection
FOR – DO
WHILE – ENDWHILE } Used to indicate a repetition
REPEAT - UNTIL
Writing pseudo codes
E.g. 1 - Finding the area of a circle
BEGIN
INPUT Radius
CALCULATE Area = 22/7 « Radius « Radius
DISPLAY Area
For free distribution
E.g. 2 - Finding whether a number is odd or even
BEGIN
READ number as N
CALCULATE Remainder after number is divided by 2
IF Remainder = 0 THEN
DISPLAY “Even number”
DISPLAY “Odd number”
ENDIF
E.g. 3 - Finding the total of some numbers
BEGIN
Total = 0
REPEAT
READ Number as N
CALCULATE Total = Total + N
UNTIL numbers are over
DISPLAY Total
E.g. 4 - Finding the total and the average of 10 numbers
BEGIN
Total = 0
Average = 0
n = 1
WHILE n <= 10
READ Number
CALCULATE Total = Total + Number
n = n + 1
ENDWHILE
CALCULATE Average = Total/(n - 1)
DISPLAY Total, Average
For free distribution
Following are some of the facts about the above pseudo code.
² Total, Average and Number are variables.
° When values are assigned to number variable, the value of Total, Average
and n variables change.
n indicates the number of repetitions. (Number of times the loop is executed)
² The statements Total = 0 and Average = 0, makes starting values of these
variables assigned as 0.
° Hence, the initial value of Total and Average are 0s.
² The statement n = 1, makes the starting value of n is assigned to 1.
² WHILE n <= 10 indicates that the loop n should be repeated until value of n is
n <= 10 is the condition that should be satisfied.
° Repetition occurs when the value of n is 10 or less than 10. This means,
till the condition n <=10 is true, repetition occurs. When the value of n
becomes 11, the repetition stops. Then the condition becomes false.
² READ denotes getting a value for Number variable.
² Total = Total + Number denotes the
present value of Total is added to
number and the resultant value is
assigned on the new value of Total.
n = n + 1 calculates the number of
repetitions. 1 is added to the present
value of n and the result is assigned
to n.
Total
number
1+1=2
0+12=12
Total
number
2+1=3
12+15=27
² ENDWHILE indicates the limit to
end repetition. Hence, only READ
number, Total = Total + Number and n = n + 1 are repeated till the condition n
<= 10 is fulfilled.
Total
number
² When the repetition stops, the value of n is 11 and the condition is false.
² By Average = Total/(n - 1) , final value of Total is divided by (n – 1) and that
value is assigned to Average variable.
² DISPLAY (Total, Average) produces the output of the total of 10 numbers and
its average.
For free distribution
Observation
² When a value is assigned to a variable, the previous value is
lost.
² When the statement Total = Total + Number is executed, the
value assigned to the Number variable is added with the value
assigned to Total variable and the result obtained is assigned
to the Total variable.
² Total = Total + Number is not a mathematical formula.
1.3.3 Converting flow charts to pseudo codes
An algorithm can be presented in a flow chart as well as in a pseudo code.
Hence, let us examine how a flow chart can be converted to a pseudo code.
Start
Put tea bag in cup
Boil water
Water boiled?
Pour water in Cup
BEGIN
Put tea bag in cup
WHILE (not water boiled)
Boil water
ENDWHILE
Pour water in cup
Stir tea
WHILE (sugar needed)
Want sugar?
Add sugar
Add sugar
Stir tea
ENDWHILE

E.g. 1 - Finding the larger number from two different numbers
Start
Input the two numbers
N1, N2
Is N1 larger than
Larger number is
BEGIN
READ N1, N2
IF N1 > N2 THEN
Large = N1
ENDIF
Large = N2
Larger number is N1
DISPLAY Large
Output the larger
number
E.g. 2 - Finding the smallest number from 10 input numbers
Start
Input the number N
Min = N
Count =1
Count < 10 ?
Input N
N < Min ?
Min = N
Count = Count + 1
For free distribution
Output Min
BEGIN
INPUT Number as N
Min = N
Count = 1
WHILE Count < 10
OUTPUT Number as N
IF N < Min Then
Min = N
ENDIF
Count = Count + 1
ENDWHILE
PRINT Min
1.4 Pascal programming
1.4.1 Identifiers
An identifier is a term used to represent a variable, constant or a program.
The following are some rules that should be followed in declaring an identifier.
² Reserved words in Pascal cannot
be used as an identifier name.
In any programming
language
reserved words cannot be used as
identifiers.
E.g. - BEGIN, END are not valid
(E.g. - A-Z, a-z)
reserved word
variable identifier
Var year : integer;
integer
data type
² Should start with an English letter.
² After the first letter of the identifier, letters (a-z, A-Z) or numbers (0-9) and
underscore ( _ ) can be used.
E.g. - Student_name
² Not case sensitive (E.g. - Art, art, ART will be the same identifier)
² There should not be any space between words.
E.g. - Student Name - Not valid
For free distribution
² The special characters such as the following should not be included in an
identifier.
~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) - + = { } [ ] : ; ‘ “ <> ? , . / | \
but, only underscore ( _ ) is valid.
² Use of meaningful terms for identifiers can make program easily understood.
Examples of valid identifiers
Sum, SUM, Total_Nos, Num1, FirstName, Last_Name
Examples of identifiers that are not valid
$75, Average Marks, 9A, Last-name
1.4.2 Reserved words
The reserved words in Pascal, are defined in Pascal language. Hence,
reserved words are not used as identifiers.
Reserved words are different from language to language. The following are
reserved words used in Pascal.
array
begin
const
constructor
destructor
downto
exports
function
implementation
inherited
inline
interface
label
library
object
packed
procedure

record
repeat
string

while
For free distribution
1.4.3 Standard data types in Pascal
When a program is executed, the input and output should be stored in
computer memory. The space needed for each is defined according to the data type.
Hence, it is essential for a programmer to have knowledge of data types.
The following are data types and their ranges.
Integer - Plus or minus whole numbers
E.g. - 0, 46, -12
Real - Plus or minus decimal numbers
E.g. - 0.0, 25.68
Boolean
True or False
Char - Any character of the key
board
E.g. - ‘k’, ‘#’, ‘7‘
String - Any sequence of characters
E.g. - ‘ICT’, ‘programming’, ‘Sri Lanka’
I m p o r t a n t
Values of Char and String are included inside single quotation ‘ ’.
1.4.4 Variables and constants
Variable
A variable is an identifier which changes the values given to it when the
program is being executed.
For free distribution
In Pascal, “var” is used to declare variables.
Retrive
Store
n1, n2 : integer;
E.g. - var count : integer;
var a,b : real;
Avg : real ;
Pass : boolean;
Character : char;
Name,school : String;
I m p o r t a n t
A variable has a name, and it stores a value of the declared type.
Constants
The identifiers which do not change their values while the program is
executed are called constants. In Pascal, “const” is used to declare a constant.
Example
Const
Const
max = 100;
pi = 22/7;
Observation
² When executing a program, a variable can take different
values. However, the value of a constant remains unchanged.
1.4.5 Operators
Operators are required to perform calculations, comparisons, and to evaluate
logical expressions. Hence, operators are essential in programming.
For free distribution
Basic types of operators
1. Algebra operators
Operator Usage Example expression Result
Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
Division of round numbers 20 DIV 6
Remainder after division 20 MOD 6
6 + 3
7 - 5
2 * 5
2. Comparison operator
Comparison operators are used to compare values or expressions. The final
result of an expression which consists of a comparison always takes a Boolean
value. Hence expression will be True or False.
Function Usage Example expression Result
False
False
7 > 3
Greater than
Greater than or equal 8 >= 8
Less than
Less than or equal
Equal
Not equal
3 < 2
4 <= 6
3 = 1
2 < > 5
3. Logical operators
Logical operators are used to combine two or more expressions. For further
study on this refer. basic logic gates that you learnt in Grade 10.
For free distribution
i) AND operator
AND operator takes the form “(First Expression) AND (Second
Expression)”. Depending on the first expression or second expression being True
or False, the result becomes True or False. The following table shows the function
of AND.
First Expression Second Expression (First Expression) AND (Second

Example
False
False
Expression)
False
False
False
(Rain fall > 56) AND (Temperature < 30)
(Height > 60) AND (Age < 15)
3. Let us consider, (3 >= 2) AND(3 < > 3)
3 >= 2 is True. 3 < > 3 is False. Hence, the result of the expression is False.
I m p o r t a n t
 If at least one operator out of the two operators is false, the AND
evaluates to false.
 When only both operators are true, the expression of AND
evaluates to true.
ii) OR operator
OR operator takes the form “(First Expression) OR (Second Expression)”.
Depending on the first expression and second expression being True or False, the
result of OR is True or False. The following table shows the function of the OR
operator.
First expression

expression)
False
Example
(Temperature > 30) OR (Rainfall < 55)
Let us consider, (3 >= 2) OR (3 < > 3)
3 >= 2 is True. 3 < > 3 is false. Hence, the result of the expression is true.
I m p o r t a n t
 When at least one operator out of the two operators is true, the
OR operator evaluates to true.
 When only both operators are false, the expression of OR operator
evaluates to false.
iii) NOT operator
A True expression is always evaluated as false with a NOT operator while a
false expression is always evaluated as true.
Expression
False
NOT (Expression)
False
Example
1. NOT (Temperature > 30)
2. NOT(5 = 5) is indicated as false statement.
Therefore 5 = 5 is a true expression. Hence, the statement NOT (5 = 5) is
indicated as false

Note : To write comments (*..............*) can also be used.
“program”, “input” and “output” are reserved words.
“addNum” is an identifier. This is the name of the program. It is not essential to
indicate input, output within brackets with the program name.
read( ) and readln( ) functions words are used for input.
¾ Data is input to num1 variable through Read(num1);
¾ Data is input from readln() from a new row.
For free distribution
² write( ) and writeln( ) functions are used for output.
¾ From the function Write(‘Welcome Pascal Programming’) outputs
'Welcome Pascal Programming'.
¾ The function writeln(‘Average is ‘ , avg); prints the value of the Avg
variable in a new line.
When writing Pascal statements;
² Semi-colon (;) is used at the end of an
statement. Semi-colon indicates the end of
an statement.
Total
num 1
num 2
² What happens with
the expression
total :} num1 + num2 is that it adds the
variables num1 and num2 and assign result
to the variable 'total'
“:}’’ is the assignment operator.

Nested IF
When there are multiple conditions one after the other, Nested IF is used.

Is M >= 75?
Is M >= 65?
Is M >= 50?

1.4.7 Repetition
Let us examine how repetition structures are used when the number of
repetitions is known in advance.
i) FOR – DO structure (1st Method)
FOR Variable :} Value_1 TO Value_2 DO
² The data type of Variable , Value_1 and Value_2 should be integer.
² The value of Value_2 should be larger than Value_1 to start repetition.
² Repetition is started with Value_1 and ended with Value_2.
² Hence, FOR – DO structure can be used when the number of repetitions is
known in advance.
Repetition structure
FOR X :}1 TO 5 DO
FOR X :} 0 TO 4 DO
FOR X :} 5 TO 10 DO
Starting
value
Ending
value
Number of repetitions
For free distribution
E.g. - Printing the values from 1 to 10
Program print10Nos(input,output);
Begin
count : integer;
For count :} 1 to 10 do
Writeln(count);
Here the count variable value is changed from 1 to 10 while printing the
output values, and two loop is executed 10 times.
ii) FOR – DO Loop (Method 2)
FOR Variable :} Value_1 DOWNTO Value_2 DO
² The value of Value_1 should be smaller than Value_2 to start repetition.
² Repetition is started with Value_1 and ended with Value_2.
Repetition structure
Starting value Ending value
FOR X :} 10 DOWNTO 5
FOR X :} 4 DOWNTO 0 DO
Number of
repetitions
E.g. - Printing of values from 10 to 1
Program print Reverse (input,output);
Begin
count : integer;
For count :} 10 downto 1 do
Writeln(count);
Count variable value is changed from 10 to 1 while printing the output and
and the loop in executed 10 times.
For free distribution
Finding the total and average of ten numbers
program total_avg (input,output);
I,num,total : integer;
avg: real;
Begin
total :} 0;
for I :} 1 to 10 do
begin
writeln(‘Enter Number’);
read(num);
total :} total+num;
avg :} total/I;
writeln(‘Total is ‘ , total);
writeln(‘Average is ‘,avg);
I m p o r t a n t
A block of statments in
repetition.
A block of statements indent properly is written between 'begin' and
'end'; inside the FOR loop.
When the number of repetitions are not known in advance, ''While do'' or
''repeat until'' structures are used.
i) WHILE DO Loop
² Conditions are checked at the beginning of the loop.
² Statements inside the loop are executed (ie: a loop that runs for ever) only if the
condition is true.
² Statements inside the loop never executed if the condition is false.
² The condition becomes false at the end of the repetition.
If the condition does not become false while the repetition is executed, it will
be an infinite loop.
E.g. 1 - while number > 0 do
Repetition is executed if only the value of the variable number is positive.
E.g. 2 - number :} 1;
while number <= 10 do
number :} number + 1;
For free distribution
◦ Condition is true since the starting value of the variable 'number' is 1.
◦ Hence, the repetition is executed.
◦ Each time loop is executed, 1 is added to the value of ''number''.
◦ Hence, Loop is executed when the value of ''number'' is 10 or less than 10.
◦ Loop stops when the value of the ''number'' variable is 11.
ii) REPEAT UNTIL Structure
² Condition is not checked at the beginning of loop.
² Condition is checked, after the statements are executed once.
² Loop is started if the condition is false only.
² Loop stops when the condition becomes true.
If the condition does not become true while the loop is executed, loop will be
an infinite loop.
E.g. 1 -
count = 0;
Repeat
writeln ^‘Pascal’&;
count :} count + 1
Until count > 5;
◦ The starting value of count variable is 0.
◦ The word Pascal is displayed on the screen.
◦ 1 is added to the count variable.
◦ Loop is executed till the value of the 'count' variable becomes 5.
◦ Loop stops when the value of count is 6.
◦ When the Loop stops, the word Pascal is displayed six times on the screen.
It is checked whether the value of 'count' variable is larger than 5.
E.g. 2 -
sum :} 0;
repeat
sum :} sum + 5;
writeln(sum);
until sum < 50;
For free distribution
5 is added to the value of sum.
² The starting value of sum variable is 0.
² The value of sum is 5 and it is displayed on the screen.
² The condition sum < 50 is satisfied (True).
² Hence, Loop stops.
It is checked whether the value of sum variable is less than 50.
E.g. 3 -
sum :} 0;
repeat
sum :} sum + 5;
writeln^sum&;
until sum >= 50;
It is checked whether the value of sum variable is greater than or equal to 50.
5 is added to the value of sum.
² The starting value of sum variable is 0.
² The value of sum is displayed on the screen.
² Loop is executed till sum >= 50 condition is satisfied (True).
² When the loop stops, the value of sum is 50.
² Loop is executed 10 times.
² Multiples of 5 from 5 to 50 will be given as output.
1.4.8 Nested control structures
Inside an algorithm, a control structure(s) may be included inside another.
For example, a repetition loop may be included inside another repetition. Similarly
a selection may be included inside another selection. Hence nested controlling
structures should be used in programming.
1.4.8.1 Repetition inside selection
A repetition may be executed depending on a condition of a selection being
satisfied or not.
E.g. - Depending on the user’s selection, an ascending or descending number
sequence can be produced as output.
For free distribution
program orderNos(input,output);
num:integer;
cho:char;
begin
writeln('Select Assending(A) or Desending(D)');
read(cho);
if cho = 'A' then
begin
writeln('Asending Order');
for num :} 1 to 6 do
writeln(num);
if cho = 'D' then
begin
writeln('Desending Order');
for num :} 6 downto 1 do
writeln(num);
1.4.8.2 Selection in repetition
Let us consider how selection takes place while the repetition control structure
being executed.
E.g. - Determining whether the numbers input by the user are odd or even and
calculating the total number of odd, even numbers separately.
program rep_sel(input,output);
var num,rem,count,e_count,o_count:integer;
begin
for count :} 1 to 10 do
begin
writeln('Enter Number');
read(num);
rem :} num mod 2;
if rem = 0 then
begin
writeln('Even number ');
e_count :} e_count+1;
For free distribution
begin
writeln('Odd number ');
o_count :} o_count + 1;
writeln(e_count,'Even Number/s');
writeln((o_count ,'Odd Number/s');
1.9.1 Arrays
It is essential in programming to use variables to store data items in
memory. Further, such variables have suitable data types. Various variables which
are different in names are needed to store data items which belong to the same data
type.
E.g. - For instance, five variables are needed to save five round numbers in the
memory. Before using such variables, they should be declared as given below.
p, q, r, s, t : integer;
n1, n2, n3, n4, n5 : real;
1.4.9.1 Use of arrays
An array is used to save data items of the same type in memory using a
single variable identifier name. Hence, use of array enables to store data as required
under a single variable identifier name without providing different variable names
to each item.
Here comes the data
train
Each cart holds a
single piece of data
For free distribution
1.4.9.2 Defining a one-dimensional array
This is a data structure used to save data of the same type sequentially. An
array uses a group of adjoining memory spaces. A one dimensional array can be as
follows.
Var Name_of_Array ( array [first index .. last index] of data type
E.g. - var marks ( array [0''9] of integer;
² From this, the array named marks is defined which can include 10 whole
numbers.
1.4.9.3 Attributes of an array
² Elements of an array are positioned next to each other. (re adjacently)
² The index of an array (sequential number) is indicated with the array name in
square brackets.
Array Name
Index
First element
lowest index
Last element
highest index
element 1
element 5
For free distribution
E.g. - the size of the array Var M : Array[0..4] of integer; is 5.
From M[0] to M[4], it consists of 5 elements.
Index is indicated in square brackets.
Depending on the way array is defined, index positions get changed.
E.g. - ; Var X : Array[1..5] of integer;
Only data items which belong to the same type can be stored in the array.
Any element of the array can be accessed randomly. Hence, an array can be
accessed easily through a repetition control structure.
E.g. - Entering Maths marks of 40 students into an array
var maths : array[0..39] of integer;
i,marks : integer;
for i :} 0 to 39 do
begin
writeln(‘Enter marks’);
read(marks);
maths[i] :} marks;
1.4.9.4 Assigning values to an array
Let us consider integer array with 5 five elements which can input whole numbers.
var num : array[0..4] of integer;
num[0] num[1] num[2] num[3] num[4]
num[0] :} 45;
num[2] :} 36,num[4] :} 60;
num[1] :} num[4] + 15;
num[3] :} num[0] + num[2]
For free distribution
1.4.9.5 Declaring values of an array
The elements declare the values of an array.
writeln ^num[3]&;
writeln ^num[1]" num[4]&;
for x :} 0 to 3 do
Print the 4th element (81)
Declaring 2nd and 5th elements (36, 60)
Print the first 4 elements of the array (45, 75,
36, 81)
writeln ^num[x]&;
for x :} 2 to 4 do
writeln ^num[x]&;
for x :} 0 to 4 do
Print the 3 elements - 3rd, 4th, 5th - of the array
(36, 81, 60)
Print all the elements of the array (45, 75, 36,
81, 60)
E.g. - Entering Information and Communication Technology marks of 35 students,
determining the highest mark and calculating the average.
program ictMarks(input,output);
var marks : array[0..34] of integer;
i,tot,max : integer;
avg : real;
begin
for i :} 0 to 34 do
begin
writeln('Enter Marks');
read(marks[i]);(* Read Marks to array *)
tot :} tot + marks[i];(* Add marks *)
avg :} tot/35;
max :} marks[0];
for i :} 1 to 34 do
if marks[i] > max then max :} marks[i];
writeln('Maximum marks = ', max);
writeln('Average marks = ',avg);
1.4.10 Use of sub - programs

it will be difficult to read and understand and also to maintain. Therefore, using sub
programs as much as possible while writing useful.

1.10.1 Types of sub - program
There are two types of sub - programs in addition to the main program. A sub
- program which returns an output back to the main program and a sub - program
which does not return an output back to the main program. A sub - program which
returns an output back is called a Function and a sub - program which does not give
an output is called a Procedure.

1.5.2 Low level programming languages
Machine language
This is a language which can be directly understood by the computer.
Binary numbers such as 0s and 1s (bits) are used to provide instructions. Hence, the
processor could directly run a program written in a machine language.
A program written in machine language has the following features;
² Could be executed directly on the machine
² Fast in operation
² No need of language translating programs to translate the program into binary
² Dependency on machines (a program written to one computer may not run
on another computer)
² Difficult to understand by humans as it is written using 0 and 1.
Assembly language
Instead of commands written in a machine language using 0 and 1, assembly
language is designed to use simple symbols.
A program written in assembly language has the following features:
² Operation is comparatively slower than the machine language.
² Assembly language should be translated to instructions using the language
translating program called assembler.
² Dependency on machines (a program written for one computer cannot be
run on another computer.)
² The use of symbols makes it more simple to understand.

1.5.4 Programming language types
Programming is a creative task where a computer programmer provides
instructions to the computer on how to perform a particular task. A program can be
defined as a set of instructions which instructs the computer which task should be
carried out to find a solution to a certain problem.
There are many different approaches to computer programming. These are
called programming paradigms. Different approaches develop solutions to problems
using programs using different paradigms. Even though most of the programming
languages come under one paradigm type, certain languages show elements related
to different paradigms.

There are a number of programming languages. There are differences
among different programming language types.
Difference between procedural and declarative paradigms
A procedural language is a computer programming language which consists
of a well structured set of steps and procedures. This includes statements for problem
solving steps.
Example -
Procedural Programming
Procedure 1
Declarative Procedure
Procedure 2
Declarative Procedure
Procedure 3
Data is
exchanged
between
procedures
For free distribution
The Pascal programming has procedural paradigm features.
A declarative paradigm develops a structure and elements of computer
program by indicating calculations and/or logic without a control flow. This helps to
reduce or eliminate side effects. In declarative programming, program is designed
to solve problems explaining what you want rather than stating how to solve the
problem as in primary programming languages. The program itself does not explain
how it is executed. This means the computer is provided only what the problem and
the required solutions are, not how to solve it. The computer finds solutions related
to the given problem. This is completely different from procedural paradigms which
execute algorithm as explanatory steps. Declarative paradigms related to Artificial
Intelligence.

blocks
Comparison of structured and object oriented paradigms
A structured program is a logic based paradigm and it is the pre discussed
object oriented program. A structured programming paradigm provides facilities to
understand and modify the program. The system is divided into sub systems and
there is a top – down flow in it.
Structured Program
Informs the user to enter data
Retrieves data entered by the user
Data is processed
User is given the output
For free distribution
The Pascal programming has the structure of structured programming as
well.
Object
Object oriented programming is a
programming paradigm based on the concept
of objects. Objects consists of data and
methods. Methods are codes that are in the
form of procedures that handle data. These
data structures exist in the form of fields which
are called Attributes. Class is the basic structure of object oriented programming.
Class describes the behaviours of data and instances. Class can create objects of
same type.

An object-oriented program consists of many objects interacting
with each other by sending messages

1.5.4 Language translators
Programs written in any computer language except in machine language
(object code) should be translated to machine language instructions before
execution.
A program written in assembly language is translated to machine language
instructions using a language translator called assembler.
Two types of language translators can be used to translate a program written in a
high-level language to machine language instructions. They are:
Interpreter
2. Compiler
For free distribution
Interpreter
This is the language translator which translates each statement written in a
high-level computer language to machine language commands one by one and the
translated program is executed using the necessary commands instantly.
When translating object codes in computer languages which use interpreters,
If there are no syntax errors in the program, the statement will be executed
If there are syntax errors in the program, it will not execute to the end. (it is
possible to operate it till the error is reached)

When translating source code to machine code in computer languages which
use compilers:
If there are no syntax errors in the program, code is translated to machine code.
If there are syntax errors in the program, it is not be translated to machine code.
These errors are highlighted.
I m p o r t a n t
After the program is translated to machine code once, it can be
execute any number of times. A translation is needed again only if
the source code is changed.

Summary
Input, output and the process can be identified by analyzing a problem.
² Flowcharts and pseudo codes can be used to develop an algorithm.
² Sequence, selection and repetition are three control structures used in an
algorithm.
² Sequence performs steps in an algorithm one after the other from the
beginning to the end.
² Selection is a situation where the step executed should be decided based on
a condition being fulfilled or not.
If a step or some steps in an algorithm are repeated until a condition is
satisfied or to maintain the condition being satisfied, it is called repetition.
² A name used to identify a variable, constant or a program is called an
identifier.
If the values assigned for identifiers are changed when the program is being
executed, these are called variables.
² Pascal is a high level programming language.
For free distribution
² Evaluation of an expression occurs depending on the priority level of
functions.
² Machine language and Assembly language are considered low–level
programming languages.
² Languages like PASCAL, BASIC, C and JAVA are examples of high–level
programming languages.
² A program written using Machine language can be directly run in the
processor.

System Development Life Cycle
After studying this chapter, you will understand the following:
Interactions among components in a system
² What is a system?
² Manual information systems vs computer based information systems
² The ability to determine why a system is necessary
² Steps in the development process of an information system
² The use of life cycle models to develop information systems
2.1 The Concept of Information Systems
What is a system?
A system is a collection of components that interact to achieve a specific
task.
According to figure 2.1 below, the elements that form the road construction
machine are not interconnected. Therefore, the machine does not function properly
and road construction is not possible. Figure 2.2 highlights an interconnected road
construction machine. It is possible to use this machine for construction work in
order to achieve the goals. Figure 2.2 shows a machine working as a system.

A child admitted to a school receives a registered number. A file is prepared
which contains personal information about the child. This file also contains
information about special abilities displayed while in school and achievements
recorded.
Assume that the principal requires a progress report on the student of the
previous year. The input, process and output here are as follows;
Input
Name of student and relevant year
Process
1. Find the index number of the student
2. Find the personal file according to the index number
3. Extract the required information for the relevant year from the file
4. Prepare a report using this information
Output
Progress report on the student for the relevant year

Assume that the above school has a computer based information system
instead of the manual system. Compare and contrast the advantages
and disadvantages when the above information is obtained from the
manual system and the computer based information system.
Computer Based Information Systems
A system which converts data into Information using a computer is known
as a computer based information system.
Consider a computer based library information system. Some of the benefits
to a librarian in using a computer based library system are as follows.
² Ability to detect whether a particular book is available in the library and if
available, the location of the book.
² Ability to use a bar code to maintain issues and receipts
² Ability to automatically calculate fines for late returns

2.2 System Development Processes
To develop an information system, there are different methodologies. The
System Development Life Cycle is one aspect of the process.
For free distribution
For free distribution
2.2.1 System Development Life Cycle
This has the following steps.
Identification of requirements
2. Designing the solution
3. Coding of the solution
4. Testing and debugging
5. Deployment of the system
6. Maintenance of the system
This process can be iterated to go back to the first step when new requirements
arise.
Phases of System Development Life Cycle
1. Identification of requirements
A complete investigation on the existing manual system or the computer
based system to be delivered is carried out in this phase. Aspects such as objectives,
benefits, efficiency etc are constructed. This is carried out in collaboration with the
staff of the organization and the development team.
At this stage the system analyst will study the existing system extensively
and identify new requirements. The developer also collects information to fulfill the
needs of the user.
There are several methods of gathering information. Some of them are as follows;
1. Observation
Interviews
3. Questionnaires
4. Document sample collection
5. Prototyping
1. Observation
At the initial stages of developing a computer based system, the existing
system is observed as it is, to gather information. This is important towards making
assumptions.
E.g. - Observation of issuing of books in a library
2. Interviews
Since the interview provides an opportunity to discuss matters related to
personal attitudes openly, it is useful to identify personal requirements.
E.g. - Meeting the librarian for a discussion.
For free distribution

3. Questionnaires
A questionnaire is used in user requirement gathering. Answers collected
are analyzed for understanding the needs.
E.g. - Handing over a questionnaire to the librarian for his/her responses
4. Document sample collection
Reports or files maintained in an organization under study are examined for
information.
E.g. - Reports, library cards available in a library
5. Prototyping
A model or a prototype of the proposed system to be implemented is
developed and demonstrated to the staff and the users for feedback and comments.
E.g. - A display of screenshots, records, samples
2. Designing the solution
At this stage, actual design of the proposed system takes
place. Some activities related to the design process are as
follows:
1. Identification of software and software architecture
2. User interface - what the user sees on the screen and preparation for data
storage
Identification of main hardware systems and its components
Identification of dependency of each sub-system
5. Deciding on the required hardware and software to run the system
6. Designing infrastructure for software, databases, user interfaces
7. Planning of tests
3. Coding of the solution
The main objective of this stage is coding
of the proposed system, using a suitable computer
language. Making the code simple and efficient
enables one to develop and understand easily. A
well-written code makes it easy to read and
understand and reduces maintenance cost.

4. Testing and debugging
The main objective of this phase is to resolve
errors. Errors in cording, planning and requirements
are corrected.
There are several methods to test a system.
Some of them are as follows:
Unit testing
Integration testing
System testing
Acceptance testing
Figure 2.5 - System Testing
1) Unit Testing
Each unit in the system is tested. Outputs are tested against
the given output.
E.g. - Testing the units related to the Accounts branch and
Establishment branch independently.
2) Integration Testing
Units already tested and debugged are integrated to form
the complete system and the integrated system is tested at this
stage.
3) System Testing
The complete system is tested for its outputs for the given
inputs.

For free distribution
4) Acceptance Testing
Acceptance or user acceptance testing is carried out at the
late stages of testing. This testing is carried out at with the users
of the system and the user is allowed to use the system. Either
the user approves or request for more improvements.
5. Deployment of the system
Deployment (ie install and use) of the system which has
been tested and debugged is carried out at this stage.
There are different deployment approaches to deploy a
system. They are as follows:
1. Direct deployment
2. Parallel deployment
3. Pilot deployment
4. Phased deployment
Direct deployment
The existing system is totally terminated and the new
system is installed. If the new system proves successful, the old
system can be abandoned.
E.g. - The manual system in the library can be totally abandoned
using and new library management software can be
installed.
Parallel deployment
Pilot deployment
The existing and the new systems are used
parallel for a certain period. If the new system
proves successful, the old system can be terminated
and the new system continues.
E.g. - Using the newly deployed system in the library
together with the existing manual system.
Pilot deployment is about using the newly
developed system in a selected area.
E.g. - A system for the whole country can first be
installed in a selected district.
For free distribution
For free distribution
E.g. - A system for revenue collection from vehicles can first be installed in one
province of the country and if, successful, can be deployed in all provinces
of the country.
Phased deployment
Here, the new system is deployed in stages.
Success with each stage leads to the next and in
completing the new system, the old system is
completely replaced by the new.
E.g. - Types of books in school library, i.e. Dictionaries first, course books second
and fiction last, to be deployed in stages.
6. Maintenance of the system
A system once installed and in the use for a
certain period, needs to be maintained well. The
computers, software and computer networks are all
maintained in this manner.
With system maintenance, the following may
be required.
² Developing systems to suit new user requirements
Issues that surfaced with the use of the system which were not identified during
system development.
² Adopting new, technology into the new system to improve efficiency
2.2.2 System Development Life cycle Models
There are several models of Systems Development Life Cycle. Each model
facilitates the system development in different ways. Some example models are:
1. Waterfall Model
2. Iterative Incremental Model
3. Prototyping Model
4. Spiral Model
Waterfall Model
The Waterfall Model consists of several stages of linear development. To
develop a system using the Waterfall Model, the following need consideration.
For free distribution
For free distribution
² First identify requirements
² Complete one stage before going to the next phase
² The result of the developed system is found at the final stage. This model has a
limitation of developing a system that is different to what the user wants as the
user sees the system at the end of the Life Cycle.
Figure 2.6 - Phased System development model - Waterfall model
Iterative Incremental Model
Iterative Incremental Model is also used as a system development model.

Figure 2.7 - Iterative Incremental Model
Testing
For free distribution
In this model, a system is developed through repeated cycles (Iterative)
and in smaller portions at a time (incremental). The process starts with a simple
implementation of a sub-set of the software requirements and iteratively enhances
the evolving versions until the complete system is implemented. At each iteration,
design modifications are made and now functional capabilities are added. This
modal allows software developers to take advantage of what was learned during
development and use of the system.
Activity
Compare and contrast the Waterfall model with iterative incremental
model.
Summary
² A system is the collection of different components that usually interconnected
towards a common objective.
² Any system consists of three basic components namely input, process and
output.
Information systems transform data into information.
Information systems can be divided into Manual Information Systems and
Computer based Information Systems.
² Manual Information Systems does not use computers and performs tasks
using human.
² Computer based Information Systems use a computer to transform data into
information.
² A system can be developed or an existing system can be made more efficient
by using the system development life cycle.
² The system development life cycle consists of the following:
1. Identification of Requirements
2. Designing Solution
3. Coding of Solution
4. Testing and Debugging
5. Deployment of System
6. Maintenance of System
² The waterfall life cycle model and iterative incremental models are examples
for system development life cycles.

3.1.1 Introduction of the Internet
The Internet is a collection of computer
networks around the world. It is the fastest
available way to share information with the
world community (Information super highway).
With the use of Internet today, the whole world
has become a global village. The Internet, which
renders such a big service, does not possess a
single owner and a non profitable organization called "The Internet Society" is
in charge of the ethics and principles related to the use of the Internet and the
protocols which maintain Internet operations. When you access the Internet from
your computer, it also becomes a computer which belongs to the Internet. Then it is
possible for you to obtain any information related to any subject you need.

3.1.2 Let us examine what URL is
Information which helps us to improve our knowledge is a very important
resource. Among the avenues of obtaining information, the Internet is the most
powerful. To transmit this information among the computers in the Internet, the
protocol called HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is used. Further, the Internet
contains a huge amount of information. The main service which provides this
information is the World Wide Web (www). Therefore, the information in the World
Wide Web is included in web sites. Thus, the system used to uniquely identify
various resources in web sites is the Uniform Resource Locator (URL).
Let us identify parts of a URL
For example, let us consider the URL given below.
http://www.edupub.gov.lk/e-books/english/ict.pdf
We can separate the parts here as given below.

3.1.3 what is an IP address?
Internet Protocol (IP) addresses are used to individually identify all the
computers in the Internet. The IP address is indicated in four values from 0 to 255
separated by a decimal point. This is called Dotted Decimal Notation.
Example
172.64.85.42
193.213.78.154
Figure 3.2 - Using IP addresses to identify computer in the Internet
These IP addresses are assigned by an Internet Service Provider (ISP). An
Internet Service Provider (ISP) is a company and it provides access to Internet. For
this, the ISP charges a fee for the service.
3.1.4 what is a domain name?
Let us consider
the domain name
edupub.gov.lk of the Uniform Resource Locator
given above. Here gov represents the government
and lk represents Sri Lanka. Thus, lk domain which
comes after gov domain is the top level domain name.
Domain name gives an identity to all the websites
which exist in the Internet.
Following are the names used to represent the fields which the domains
belong to.

3.1.5 How the Internet works
Humans, being different from computers, have difficulty in retaining lots
of similar numbers in mind. Working with names is much easier for them and
cause less errors. That is why we rarely see the numbers as URLs on the Internet.
When a URL is entered to the browser to view a website, the request must first be
translated from the readable written address into an IP address that can be routed.
This translation is done by the Domain Name System (DNS).
If a request is made to connect to certain website, for example www.yahoo.
com, the request is first sent to the DNS server to translate into the correct IP
address of 209.191.122.70. The actual connection to the website is done with this
IP address. This process happens behind the screen quickly that the user does not
notice.

The Internet is a Wide Area Network (WAN) which is based on a Client
Server Model. Hence, all the computers in Internet belong either to the type of
servers or clients.
Figure 3.4 - Client server architecture in the Internet
The computer that distributes the resources required by the client computer
is called the "server".
The activity of retrieving information from the server computers to
client computers is called "downloading".
The activity of providing information from client computers to
server computers is called "uploading".
Hence, transfer of information between server and client computers is
two-way.
Let us identify some Internet server computers.
Web Server - Storing web pages and providing these to the client computers
Mail Server - Storing electronic mail and providing them to the client computers
DNS Server - translating URL to IP addresses

3.1.6.1 World Wide Web (WWW)
World Wide Web is a service provided by
the Internet and it is a large collection of electronic
documents saved in computers all around the
world connected to the Internet.
Sir Tim Berners Lee is considered the
father of www. A user who uses www can access
web sites through a Web Browser.
A Web Browser is an application software.
Following are some examples of Web Browsers.
A web site consists of several web pages.
There can be written text, images, videos and
other multimedia and hyperlinks included in a web
page. Use of hyperlinks makes browsing the web
sites easy. To access a web site, Uniform Resource
Locator – URL (web site address) should be typed
on the address bar of the web browser and the
‘Enter’ key pressed. The page which contains
the basic information about the web site is called
the ‘Home Page’. The other pages of the web site can be accessed through the
hyperlinks included in it.
Figure 3.5 - Web Browsers

3.1.6.2 File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
File of smaller size can be sent with an e mail
as an attachment. But files with larger capacities cannot
be sent in an e mail attachments.
FTP is used to transfer large files of one
computer in the Internet to another computer. This
protocol is operated on TCP/IP and used to upload files of a client computer to the
Internet and to download files from server computers in the Internet.
Figure 3.7 - File transfer system
3.1.6.3 Remote Access
For free distribution
Figure 3.8 - Remote access
Controlling and operating a computer in the Internet remotely is performed
through remote access. Following are certain functions which can be performed
through Remote Access after accessing the Internet.
1. Installing software of server computers to client computers.
2. Fixing problems on client computers.
For free distribution
Using remote access functionality sometimes hackers steal important data
and information stored on computers without owner's knowledge (This is called
hacking).
3.1.6.4 File Sharing
The main objective of computer networking is
to share resources. Such resource sharing includes file
sharing. Thus, sharing of various files in the Internet take
place often.
Example
1. When you check exam results on line, that file is accessed by a large number of
clients at the same time.
2. Thousands of users can be connected to a web site at the same time.
3.1.6.5 Streaming of Media
Basic Streaming Process
A user visits a Web
page hosted on a Web
server and finds a file
he'd like to see or hear.
The Web server sends
a message to streaming
media Server, requesting
the specific file.
Media Server
The streaming
server streams the
file to the user's
computer, bypassing
the Web server
4 The client software on the user's
computer decodes and plays the file

Internet provides much assistance to share all sorts of information which
consists of multimedia such as text, images audio and video. Downloading images,
songs and videos etc from the Internet can be considered as an example.
3.1.6.6 Search Engines
Web sites largely contain information on the
Internet. These websites should obtain information.
For this, you should know the address (URL) of the
web site. However, the unlimited number of websites
in the Internet makes it practically very difficult.
Search engines are designed for the Internet
users to find any information easily.
After typing the key words in the search box of the search engine and
clicking the search button, you will get a large number of web sites with hyperlinks
which contain the information you need. You can obtain the necessary information
by clicking one or several hyperlinks.
Given below are some examples of search engines used often.
http://www.google.com or http://www.google.lk
http://www.yahoo.com
http://www.ask.com
http://www.msn.com
3.1.7 Domain Name Server
Figure 3.10 - Domain names are converted to IP address by domain server
Domain name is used to uniquely identify a web site. This makes the users
remember it somewhat easily. However, an IP address is used to uniquely identify
a computer on the Internet. What the Domain Name Server does is converting the
domain name to an IP address.

3.3 Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is the practice of using a network
of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage
and process data, rather than a local server or a personal
computer. The main services of cloud computing are
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
² Platform as a Service (PaaS)
² Software as a Service (SaaS)

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
This provides a virtual environment of servers to provide space to store data
and software applications with the help of server computers and also to provide
various resources through the use of large data centres established.
E.g. - Obtain the facilities of server space and firewall through cloud computing
even though you do not own them
Platform as a Service (PaaS)
This platform provides necessary server environment for software
development. This gives facilities including operating system, programming
language environment, database and web server.
E.g. - Software can be developed in the cloud computer service even though you do
not have installed operating system or compilers in your computer.
Software as a Service (SaaS)
This provides software installed in cloud without installing the software
required by the user.
This reduces the cost and complexity of buying and managing hardware and
developing software needed for software by the user.
E.g. - In Android devices, word processing software, spreadsheet packages etc that
can be used not by installing them in the device but using a web browser.

4.1 Digital Graphics
From times immemorial man practiced the art of drawing and colouring
to portray a beautiful idea, or a visual that left a lasting impression. Ancient wall
paintings remind us about the important role played by artistry in conveying ideas.
Pictures formed the basis of communication. At the same time, available pictures
make us realize the difficulties our ancestors would have faced to convert an idea
into an illustration. There would have been many drawbacks in mixing of colours.
Yet, they overcame such drawbacks to leave behind the paintings seen today.
However, with the development of technology and the availability of software
for digital graphics, it is now possible to create various graphical illustrations and
edit them. Using such software for graphics is quite simple and interesting.
Drawings or images, created with the use of computer graphic software, are
called digital graphics.

Figure 4.1 - Basic elements of digital graphics
² Pixel
A pixel is a tiny illuminated dot having a colour which is displayed on a
computer screen. The digital graphics are created with thousands of such pixels.
These pixels get arranged in rows or columns close to each other to produce
graphical image (fig. 4.2). A digital graphic is an array of rectangular pixels called
a bitmap.

Fig 4.2 - Pixel
The size of a graphic can be increased or decreased to fit into a computer
screen or a printing paper. In changing the size of the original graphic, the size of
the pixel is changed. When the graphic has a smaller number of pixels its quality
decreases when it is enlarged (fig 4.3).

For free distribution
Fig 4.3 - Decrease in quality in an enlarged graphic
Colours used in a graphic are represented by the number of bits per pixel
(bpp) used. Graphics which use more bits per pixel are higher quality.
² Colours in a pixel and the number of bits
The number of bits per pixel determines the colours used in an image.
A single bit represents two colours Two bits represent four colours
two colours
four colours
However, by observing a graphic, it is not possible to determine the numbers
of colours per pixel used. The number of bits used for the pixel only help find out
the number of colours per pixel used. The following function can be used for the
purpose.
Colour per pixel used = (2) bpp ^bits per pixel&
E.g. - If a pixel has 4 bits,
Colour used on the pixel
= ^2&4
= 2 × 2 × 2 × 2
= 16 colours
To find the number of bits when the colours are known:
The number bits per pixel
= √colour
= √16
The number of bits per pixel = 4

² Resolution
Pixels are used to measure the physical
dimension of a digital graphic. The physical
dimension is displayed as the image resolution.
This illustration in Figure 4.4 is 250 pixels
wide and 175 pixels high. The image resolution,
therefore, is 250 x 75 pixels or 43,750 pixels.
250 Pixels
(43,750 Pixels)
Fig 4.4 - Image Resolution
A high resolution digital graphic using a large
number of pixels is higher in quality. To determine
the quality of a graphic the number of pixels per
inch (ppi) used (horizontal or vertical) or the number of dots per inch (dpi) used
(horizontal or vertical) are considered. (Figure 4.5)

Fig. 4.5 - Number of dots per inch (dpi)
² Colour
A digital graphic contains tens of thousands of pixels. Each pixel represents
a colour. Therefore, a pixel is a small dot with a colour.
There are about 16 million of recognizable colours visible to the naked eye.
This number comes from a mixture of colours. However, it is difficult to correctly
recognize each colour. (figure 4.6)
Ultra Violet
Colours visible to the
naked eye
Infrared
Fig 4.6 - Colours visible to the naked eye
In designing digital graphics it is possible to use many colours. The colour
model which should be used for the design must be decided based on the output
device or the media. (figure 4.7)
Two widely used colour models are shown on figure 4.7
Color Models
RGB Model
CMYK Model
Fig 4.7 - Colour Models
² RGB Model – This is widely used to create images on television screens or
computer screens using coloured lights. The Primary Colours used here are
Red, Green and Blue.
² CMYK Model – This model is used for printing on paper using coloured inks.
The Primary Colours used here are Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black.

A mix of RGB gives out secondary
colours

Fig 4.8 - Mixing colours
Colours are very useful to maintain the quality of the picture or illustration.
Single colours are known as primary colours. Colours made by mixing two colours
are known as secondary colours while tertiary colours are made by mixing three
colours. There are 256 (0 - 255) colour variations in a primary colour.
Forming a tertiary colour
To make a tertiary colour, the colour combination should be from 000, 000,
000 to 255, 255, 255. This is known as RGB Triplet and it can be represented in
octal numbers as RGB (245, 102, 36) or RGB (F5, 66, 24). (Figure 4.9)

Graphic size and compression
The size of a graphic is determined by the number of pixels, the number
of lines and the colour combinations used for the creation. A graphic with a large
number of pixels, colours and a high resolution has a large file size. There may be
difficulties in storing and transmission of such a graphic. Graphic compression is
used to compress file size. Compression can be carried out at the time of saving the
graphic or later.
The file formats used for compression in saving a graphic may or may not
cause affect to the original quality of the graphic. The file formats are created using
different algorithms to suit the compression.
There are two methods for graphic compression - Lossy compression and
Lossless compression. (Figure 4.10)

Fig 4.10 - Use of Compression methods
It is possible to compress graphics to a minimum size using Lossy file
formats, but this compression reduce the quality of the original graphic. The
reopened graphic does not show its original form. Yet, to make it faster for
compression and for saving and downloading from the Internet, Lossy compression
is useful. JPEG, TIFF, BMP are a example for Lossy file formats.
On the other hand, it is possible to compress a graphic preserving its
original quality. In opening such a file, it is displayed in its original quality. This
compression is identified as Lossless format. GIF, PNG, RAW are examples for
Lossless file formats.

Graphic Types
Digital graphics fall into two main categories. They are raster graphics and
vector graphics. The type of graphic (raster or vector) is decided according to the
graphical software used.
There is a difference between Raster graphic and Vector graphic. Let us
identify them.

Graphic Design
There are many software types for the creation of static graphics. A few of
them were mentioned earlier. Most of such software need to be purchased while
some may not be compatible for all Operating Systems. Therefore, let us see a
software that comes free and can be downloaded from the Internet.
GIMP is an image manipulation program created for GNU free and
open source operating system. This free software is widely used to reconstruct
photographs, create graphics, edit and formatting of graphics. This software with
many tools helps with the creation a simple graphic as well as to edit a high quality
photographs. GIMP software belongs produces raster graphics.
GIMP software is UNIX based. It can also be installed on Microsoft
Windows and Mac Operating system to install GIMP on a computer, go to http://

Layers
The use of Layers is important for both simple and complex
graphic creations. It is easy to manipulate objects on a graphic by using
different layers.
Layers resemble sheets of transparent paper. However, when
objects are added one above the other, the layer beneath may not be
shown.
² For, different pictures, different layers are to be created on layer
window.
² For each image a separate layer must be used on the layer window.
² This prevents alterations done on one layer affecting another layer.
(adding texts, adding colour, shapes, editing etc).
² Use the eye symbol to make the layer visible or invisible.

4.2 Two - dimensional animation
The previous lesson discussed several areas connected with the creation of
digital graphics as related to digital creations and graphic design.
The main aim of animation is to give more depth to a static graphic and
make it look real or authentic.

Creative animations are used in commercial publications, as a media to
promote products, to develop computer games and creating cartoon films.
What is animation?
Animation is an optical illusion to show the movements of an object or
objects. A series of frames of an object or objects are arranged in a sequential order
and displayed continuously to create the animation. The speeds of the objects can
be changed by changing the speed of frames.
Basics of animation
Types of Frames
Several frames are used to create an animation. They are: Key frame, Tween
frame, frames, and Blank Key frames.
² Key Frame: A key frame is the main, specialised static frame in a series of
frames to be used with the creation of an animation. The user decides on the
key frame for the creation. In a complete motion, there can be many key frames
in important positions.
E.g. - The frames used at the beginning and at the end of motion are Key Frames.
² Tween Frames: Animation is created in the Tween Frame. The purpose of a
tween frame is to create smooth motion between two frames. While the user
creates the key frames, the software creates the tween frame. It is possible to
create smooth motion of 24 frames per second (fps). In a motion consisting of
24 frames, the additional 22 frames are created as Tween frames.
E.g. - There are two key frames; one at the beginning and the other at the end.
In a motion of 24 frames, the rest of the 22 frames are created by the computer
programme. Eventually, The user creates an animation with a smooth motion
with little effort.
² Frames: When an adjoining frame is added to a frame with a content, the time
period of the content in the animation can be increased.
² Blank Keyframe: In every instance when blank key frame is added, it provides
a blank frame to include a content. However, when a creation is done in this, it
is no longer a blank key frame.

Animation
Vectorian Giatto
Vectorian Giatto is produced for animations. It is a free software and can be
downloaded from the Internet. This software is easy to use and requires no coding
unlike with some other software for animation.
The main purpose of this software is to embed motion for created images,
while there are nearly 50 flash animation tools.

Summary
Images or graphics created using graphic software are known as digital
graphics.
² Basic elements of a digital graphic are pixel, resolution, size and colour.
² Pixel is the basic element of a digital graphic. Digital graphics are made up
of thousands of pixels.
² Pixel is composed of bits. Single colour pixel is made up of 8 bits while a
colour pixel is made up of 24 (8×3) bits.
² The unit to measure the physical dimension of a digital graphic is pixel and
physical dimension is known as image resolution.
² A high resolution digital graphic has higher quality.
² There are two types of colour models;
¾ RGB model (Red, Green and Blue)
¾ CMYK Model (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black)
² Single colour- Primary colours
² Two colours - Secondary colours
² Three colours - Triplet colours
² There are 256 (1 - 256) colours
² RGB Triplet is formed from 000,000,000 to 255, 255, 255
² For example ‘RGB Triplet’ = RGB (245, 102, 36) = RGB (F5, 66, 24)

5 Web Designing Using Multimedia
After studying this chapter, you will understand the following:
² Content of a website
² Fundementals of Web designing
² Publishing a website
² Maintaining a website
5.1 Structuring information for web designing
There are several aspects that attention should be paid when designing a
web site. Imagine you are member of a group of students assigned to design a
website. You should consider factors such as the purpose, the user, and how to
maintain the website etc.
5.1.1 Web applications
There are several web applications. Examples are as follows.
i) Information Communication
There are websites designed to communicate various information such as
educational and health for the users.
Example - www.nie.lk, www.surgery.lk, www.webopedia.org
ii) e Commerce
This includes websites which sell goods and services through the Internet.
Example - www.farlin.lk, www.lego.lk, www.amazon.com
iii) Entertainment
There are websites for entertainment which provides download materials
such as songs, films and teledramas, games, broadcasts and telecasts
Example - www.islandcricket.lk, www.netflix.com, www.youtube.com

iv) Advertising
These websites provides information on goods and services provided by
various organizations.
Example - www.onclickads.net, www.adcash.com, www.myadvertisingpays.com
v) News
These websites publish news using multimedia.
Example - www.itnnews.lk, www.rupavahini.lk, www.bbc.co.uk
vi) Social Media
These websites provide facilities to develop social networking among
various groups depending on their educational background, occupation, tastes or
other factors.
Example - www.facebook.com, www.linkedin.com, www.twitter.com
vii) Search engine
These websites provide facilities to find information from the World Wide
Web using a word or a phrase as the key.
Example - www.google.com, www.msn.com, www.bing.com
viii) Personal
These are often used by popular persons such as writers and politicians to
disseminate their information.
Example - www.president.gov.lk, www.arthurcclarke.net, www.nelsonmandela.org
5.1.2 Web user groups
Those who access a website and use are known as the users of the website.
For instance, www.google.com is used by many people around the world and they
are the users of the Google website.
In designing a website, it is understood that the user is important. The
following are useful in understanding them:
1. Language and culture
2. Age
3. Educational level
4. Gender
5. Preferences
126 For free distribution
For free distribution
When designing a new website, various methods can be used to understand
the target user group.
For instance,
1. conducting a study on target users.
2. Analyzing similar websites.
For example, let us consider, the home page of the official Website of Sri
Lanka (Figure 5.1) and website of Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of
Sri Lanka. (Figure 5.2). You can observe that there are facilities to access them in
all the three languages.
The website in Figure 5.2 provides the facilities to change the font size
according to the user preference and to access social networks.

5.1.3 Web content
All the audio-visual information and services a user comes across in a
website are called its web content. The web content of the new website should be
selected considering the need/s of the user identified in the user group analysis.
Web content should include the information to be communicated to the user as well
as all the services to be provided to the user.
Various types of information and services can be found in the web content
of websites. Following are some of them:
² Texts : information given in short
Images : photos taken from a camera, clip arts, drawings, scanned
² Sound : songs, voice clips
² Video : video clips
² Copyrights and information about updates
Animations

² Hyperlinks to other documents, pictures, audio-visual files, and social
networks
² Advertisements
² Search facilities
² Facilities to download certain software required to use the website.
As an example of identifying web content, examine the website of
Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (www.trc.gov.lk) given in Figure 5.2.
5.1.4 Content Management
Systematic organization of the selected content of a website is known
as content management. The main objective of this is to provide facilities to the
users to use the website more effectively. Given below are some features of a well
organized website.
² Easy to use
² Can find the information user needs fast
² Attracts users
² Easy to update
² Has room to add new features later
If the amount of information selected for the web content of the website is
small, organizing web content is easy. However, if it contains a large amount of
various types of audio-visual information, various methods are used organizing
web content of such websites. Following are some examples;
1. Classification based on site map
By developing a site map to classify the web content, one can get a clear
picture about the web pages need to be created in the website and the hyperlinks
(link among pages) need to be created among these. For instance, in the site map
shown in Figure 5.3 - website of a school, the number of web pages need to be
created is indicated in square structures and the hyperlinks need to be created for
interlinks among those pages are indicated in lines.

2. Display a summary of the entire content of the website in the home page
To manage the space in the home page;
² Use of main menu and sub menu (Figure 5.4)
² Use of hyperlink (Figure 5.5)
Main Menu
Sub Menu
Figure 5.4 - Main menu and Sub Menu
3. Present information in brief
The attention of the user may not be drawn to some information, when
a large amount of information is included in a single web page. Therefore, the
content of a single web page should be limited.
4. Use of numbered lists, bulleted lists and indentation
This prevents the user getting exhausted by reading long text paragraphs.
5. Providing the facility for the user to navigate the website easily

6. Updating
Web site should be easy to update by the person maintaining the site. The
accuracy of information is assured when the copyrights and the updated time
periods are included clearly in each page.
5.1.5 Structure and layout
Structure and layout are the features such as backgrounds, tables, frames,
font types, font sizes, font shapes. Some of them are as follows;
1. Maintaining the identity of the website in each page
This means preserving the identity of the web pages of a single website by
keeping uniformity between backgrounds, font types, font sizes, font shapes etc.
2. Highlighting important information
For this, methods such as changing the font types and font sizes or different
colours in the related information can be adopted.
3. Ability to access the website from any computer
Various users use different
types of personal computers, various
devices such as mobile phones to
browse websites. Different sizes of
screens are used as shown in Figure
5.6. Since the screen resolutions
these devices are different,
some web pages are displayed in
different ways on different screens.
The website should be constructed
in order to adjust the size of the webpage to that of the screen automatically.

5.1.6 Selecting media resources
When selecting any type of media resource for a website such as various
texts, pictures, sounds, videos and animations, several factors should be considered.
The following are some such things to be considered;
1. Size
There is a very close connection between the size of media resources
accommodated to a certain web page and the time taken to download that web
page. If the size of these is high, more time is spent to opening that web page as
more data should be downloaded from the web server to the users' computer (client
computer). Since the users have to stay for a long time to use the web page, there
may be a possibility for them to leave the site. Therefore, various methods are
followed depending on to the media type. Following are some examples;
² Graphics
◦ Reducing the amount of pixels by removing unnecessary sections using
Crop/Trim in graphics software
graphic compression
² Video files
◦ Reducing frame size
◦ Reducing resolution
◦ Adjusting frame rate
◦ Removing unnecessary frames and sound
² Audio files
◦ Reducing the bit rate
reducing the sample rate
reducing number of channels
removing or reducing unnecessary sound
2. Use of media resources adhering copyrights
If you use media resources created by another person in your website, it
is your responsibility to obtain necessary permission from the owner. If not, it is
unethical and may lead to legal issues as well.
However, as per the fair use of principles, it is possible to use media resources
without permission for activities such as news reporting, academic purposes and
critic.

5.1.7 Use of Basic HTML
Hyper Text Markup Language, which is known as the acronym HTML,
is the language used for documents in the World Wide Web. An HTML document
which can be displayed through a web browser is called a web page. Unlike the
computer programming languages you learnt earlier such as Pascal, the codes of
HTML language shows the web browser how the web page content should be
displayed on the computer screen. Hence, HTML is not a computer language but a
Markup Language.
Now let us design some simple web pages using HTML.
Activity No 01
Step 1 -
As shown in Figure 5.7
Start → All Programs →
Accessories → Notepad
Notepad is a simple software
used in the Windows operating
system.
Step 2 -
Write statements on the Notepad
as shown in Figure 5.8.

As shown in Figure 5.9, type the file name of that notepad page as
myfirst.html and select the file type as All Files. Then save it in a
suitable folder.
Figure 5.9 -The dialogue box appear in saving the Notepad page
Step 4 -
Open the file myfirst.html. Your first web page will be displayed as
shown in Figure 5.10.
Figure 5.10 - An HTML file which is open
Step 5 -
Instead of the phrases written on the notepad page in the second
step above “This is the title” and “My first web page”, write
different phrases and create more web pages.
Step 6 -
Instead of using a word processing software like notepad, software
which are called HTML editors can be used to write HTML code.
Following are some software with the web addresses to download.
1. CoffeeCup (www.coffeecup.com/html-editor)
2. Seamonkey Composer (www.seamonkey-project.org)
3. Eclipse (https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/html-editor-
Install any one of the above software in your computer.
Step 7 -
Open the web designing tool in your computer. Given in Figure
5.11 is how the HTML editor named CoffeeCup is opened after
giving the command File → New HTML document.

You can see that a substantial number of phrases you wrote in step 02 on
notepad page are automatically written here. It makes your task easier.
Now you can insert the items in the proper places in your web page. Figure
5.12 shows how the phrases “This is the title” and “My first web page” you inserted
in the first web page.
Save this in your folder as coffeecup.html using the command File → Save

Now check the web page using preview tool. Design more web
pages by inserting more new phrases.
Observation
So far you have written HTML documents which include phrases
of HTML language or HTML codes using notepad and other
tools.
What you use in angular brackets like <html>, <head>, <title> are types of
HTML tags, which is a main feature of HTML. These tags indicate to the web
browser how the web page content should be displayed to the user. This means
the structure and layout you have selected are entered in the web page using
HTML tags.
5.1.8 The Basic Structure of an HTML Document
Figure 5.13 given shows some essential tags in the basic structure of an
HTML document. Mostly, a tag consists of an opening tag and a closing tag.
However, you will later come across some tags later which consist of an opening
tag only.
Starting html tag
Starting head tag
Closing head tag
Starting body tag
Closing body tag

Figure 5.13 - Basic structure of a HTML document
An HTML document consists of two main parts; head and body. The figure
5.13 shows clearly that the opening <html> tag shows the opening of the document
and the closing </html> tag shows the ending of the document.
For free distribution
Web page content should be included in the body part. Consider how you
indicated “My first web page” in your first web page.
There are special occasions where you make notes in the Head part. For
instance, consider again how you mentioned “This is the title” in <title> tag in your
first web page. This is displayed on Title Pane which is at the top most of your web
page.
5.1.9 Features of HTML
i) HTML tags show the web browser how the web page should be displayed. Such
commands in an HTML document are called HTML codes.
ii) There should be a pair of angular brackets (< >) at the beginning and end of an
HTML tag.
E.g. - <p> to mark the beginning of a paragraph
iii) Generally, HTML closing tags are given in pairs. “/” (back slash) with the name
of the tag should be indicated in the ending tag.
E.g. - <p> to mark the beginning of a paragraph and </p> to mark the end of
iv) Generally HTML tags are not case sensitive. That means, the use of capital or
simple letters of the English language does not affect the meaning.
E.g. - <TITLE>, <Title> or <title> does not make any difference.
v) There will be no error messages if the tag is indicated incorrectly, however, the
web browser will ignore that particular.
vi) There are three parts of an HTML tag – element, attribute and value.
E.g. - Following is the HTML code to display the plain text “I am a student”
in Times New Roman font type in blue colour.

<font face=“iskoolaPota” color = “blue”> I am a student </font>

Font tag
Figure 5.15 - HTML code to prepare the title text and its output
Let us consider the HTML tags further.
Header tag
Methods such as increasing the font size, making the letters bold etc are
used to highlight elements such as headings, sub-headings and other texts from the
rest of the document. For a web page, this is carried out using the tag called header.
There are header tags from <h1> to <h6> in the order. Out of these, <h1> makes
the letters the biggest and the bold. The size and the thickness of the letters are
decreased gradually from <h1> to <h6>.
Instead of <h2> tag of your web page, use other header tags and adjust the
title to a proper size, after checking how it is displayed on the web page.
Font tag
As you have learnt already, an HTML tag consists of three main components
– element, attribute and value. There are three main attributes in the Font tag (ie.
size, face and color). The font size attribute shows the size of the letters. For this,
you can assign the values in the range from 1 to 7. Default is size 3. That is the size
displayed automatically by the web browser when you do not assign a value to the
Font size.
Font face attribute shows the type of letters. You can assign any type of
letters available in your computer as its value. E.g. - “Ariel”, “Verdana”
Font color attribute shows the colour of the letters. There are two ways to
assign values for this.

Center tag
This is a tag used to align the title of your web page to the centre along the
horizontal axis. This can be used not only for a text, but also for other elements such
as a picture.
There are several tags like the Center tag which can be used to design texts.
Given below in Table 5.1 shows some of them.

Inserting and formatting an image
Select a picture suitable to insert to your web page. When inserting images
to a web page, it should be relatively low size file type such as .png , .gif or .jpeg.
The images to be used in the HTML document can be saved in a separate folder.
Image tag
<img> tag, which is called the image tag, is used to link an image to a web
page. This tag does not have two opening and ending tags. You will come across
several such tags later which are called blank tags or empty tags. Though there are
about 12 attributes related to the <img> element, only some important ones are
explained in Table No 5.2.

Inserting Lists
When a number of related items are indicated in an order, it is called a list.
Mostly, these items are indicated one below the other. There are three types of main
lists in web page designing in the HTML language.
i) Unordered lists
<ul> symbol is used to mark the beginning of an unordered list and the type
attribute is used to show the shape of the special symbol with its element. Here are
the three values which can be assigned to it.

Hyperlinks can be created for a certain text or image by using <a> tag
in HTML codes. There are some attributes related to this tag as well. The most
important attribute which is href, shows the place which should create the link. If
it is a file in the same folder which contains the web page, it is adequate to indicate
the file name with the file extension.
Example:
<a href=“President.jpeg”>President </a>
<a href=“President.html”>President </a>
However, if it should be connected to another web page, the relevant path
should be indicated accurately.

Caption Tag
This tag is used to include a title or a description of the table above it. Even
if there are no attributes, this caption can be decorated using the tags related to text
decoration.
Example : < Caption><b><u>Principle Forms of Land use </ u></ b></ Caption>
<tr> Tag
This element, which is indicated as <tr>, adds a new row to the table. Just
like in <table>, the attributes such as "align", "bgcolor", "border", "bordercolor"
can be used differently for separate rows.
Example : <tr bordercolor = ''green'' bgcolor = ''yellow'' background = ''image.
png''>
<td> Tag
Used to create cells to include data in a row. Just like for rows, attributes can
be added separately for cells as well.
Example : <td width = ''4'' bordercolor = ''green'' bgcolor = ''yellow'' background
=''image.png''>
Sometimes, cells should be merged adding several rows or columns of the
table. There are two attributes used for this.
1. Colspan - Used to create a cell merging several columns. The value of this
attribute is the number of columns merged.
Example :

This tag, which is called the table header tag, is used to indicate the captions
of the rows of table. However, this can be used instead of <td> tag related to any
cell of the table. What is special about this is that the text in the cell will be bold.
Including colspan and rowspan, all the attributes related to <td> tag can be used for
this tag as well.

A sound knowledge of HTML language is essential in designing websites
using simple word processors or HTML editors. Further HTML coding takes more
time. Moreover, the basic HTML codes need changing for updates and alterations.
But, there are other web designing software which facilitate web designing
quicker and more attractive. There the graphical user interface provides facilities to
designing, editing, preview and upload. As per the concept WYSIWYG (What You
See Is What You Get), you can create web pages in the same way you design them
on the graphical user interface.
There are various types of web designing software. For instance,
Web authoring tools
Content Management Systems (CMS)
5.2.1 web authoring tools
The special feature of this type of web designing software is that the relevant
HLML document is automatically prepared in a separate interface while the
designer is finishing the web page using a graphical user interface. If the designer
has knowledge of HTML coding, web page designing can be done using graphical
user interface as well as HTML document.
There are many open source web editors such as Kompozer, Ckeditor,
Bluegriffon which can be downloaded from Internet while there are lots of web
editors like Adobe dream viewer, Microsoft front page, Visual studio that are to be
purchased.

in one folder.
Step 07 -
New pages can be opened using “New tool”. Create separate
pages for each system on the Home Page. Save these in the same
folder using suitable names.
Step 08 -
After forming hyperlinks to the relevant pages, preview the web page
and format as necessary.
5.2.2 Static websites and dynamic websites
There are two types of websites according to the nature of its content as
static and dynamic.
1. Static Websites
If the content of a website is maintained without any change over a period
of time, such a website is called a static website. Normally, websites based on
HTML language are static websites. Their structure and content are designed using
HTML codes. The web content can be changed only by changing the code.
This kind of websites can be designed in a very simple way as a collection
of a number of web pages. Users are not directly connected to the web server when
using the websites. Only the designer of the website can enter the relevant changes
by connecting to the web server where the website is hosted. These websites are
safer even though it consumes more time for coding.
Websites that were created so far using word processing software, HTML
editor, web editor etc are static web sites.
2. Dynamic Websites
If the web content is often changed, such a website is called a dynamic
website. These are designed using software such as PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor),
ASP.net (Active Server Page.net), JSP(Java Server Page). Here the web server
generates information using a data base or program.
Example:
1. Current time is displayed as dynamic in a website.
2. Showing results of a candidate related to the index number.

Users are directly connected to the web server while using such websites.
Information is exchanged from the user to web server or vice versa. Hence, the
security of the website is threatened compared to a static website.
This is more appropriate for commercial, social or exam holding websites
which should be often changed. However, higher knowledge and experience are
required to build such websites in a protective way.

Figure 5.42 - Static and dynamic websites
5.2.3 Content Management Systems (CMS)
CMS can be defined as software used for dynamic website designing, content
management and publishing. It is possible for the web designer to re-publish his
website often changing its content.
Web designing and managing using CMS is very easy and fast, while
no prior knowledge of computer languages is required. Hence, CMS is the most
popular web designing tool at present.
The creativity of designing is limited to a certain range if various audio
visual information is entered to the website using templates and wizards provided
by the software. All the websites that are designed this way will be monotonous.
This weakness can be largely avoided by changing relevant codes if you possess
a sound knowledge of computer languages such as HTML, PHP, javascript, CSS,

5.2.4 Roles related to web designing
Designing a website for a certain institute and maintaining it while keeping
it updated is a team work involving in many people. Each person has a role to play
with the relevant tasks and many responsibilities. Let us identify some important
roles among those.
1. Author - Designs interfaces of the website
2. Editor - Writes codes, checks errors and rectifies those.
3. Publisher - Fulfills tasks related to the publishing of the website.
4. Administrator - Fulfills maintenance tasks related to the web server and
database.
5. Users - Use the website.
5.3 Publication of a website
Publication of a website includes the tasks such as designing website,
hosting, updating and posting etc. There are several requirements a web publisher
should fulfill for this.
1. A web designing software
2. A web host
3. A domain name
4. File transfer protocol
Internet connection
5.3.1 Web Host
The designed website should be hosted in a place where any person
can access at any time from any place through Internet. Such service providing
computers are called web hosts.
If the website is designed for a mass scale institute, normally they have their
own dedicated host. If it is for a small scale institute, they get space from shared
hosts maintained by other institutes. Shared hosts charge basic fee and annual
charge according to the allocated capasity. There are many institutes in Sri Lanka
as well as in the world which provide such web host services.
There are institutes which provide web host services free of charge as well.
You can get this facility through various websites. Here, their advertisements are
also displayed in your website.
For free distribution
162 For free distribution
Activity
Name two institutes which provide free web host services along with
their relevant web addresses.
5.3.2 Domain Name
National identity number is given to each and every person in the world to
identify a person uniquely.
In the same way, there is a system to find a website in the World Wide Web.
It is known as ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)
that bears the responsibility of assigning and administrating domain names for
websites. After designing a website, it should be registered in that institute with a
suitable domain name. Some of such other institutes are as follows.
1. www.godaddy.com
2. www.bluehost.com
3. ww.nic.lk
It is more appropriate to get registered paying a basic fee. Registration
should be renewed paying an annual fee. Sometimes, it is done by the person who
is responsible for hosting. However, if you need to host your website in another
web host later, this can create issues on registration. Hence, it is more appropriate
if the publisher himself registers the website.
Things to consider when selecting a domain name to a website.
It is appropriate to give a certain identification about the institute the website
belongs to or the objective of preparing the website through the domain name.
This makes the users easier to find the website through search engines.
Example: The web address www.nie.lk indicates the institute the website
belongs to the user by the domain name “nie”.
2. According to the nature of the website, top level domain names such as “.com”,
“.edu”, “.org”,“.lk” can be attached.
Example: The top level domain name “.org” of the web address www.
wikipedia.org indicates that it belongs to non commercial type websites.
.(Root)
com edu
net ...

Figure 5.43 - Domain names of websites
164 For free distribution
For free distribution
If the domain name is short, it is easy for the user to remember it as well as to
type it accurately.
It is not appropriate to include numbers, lines, in domain name. The reason
for this is when the web address is read orally, it may not be communicated
correctly to the listener.
Example:
Reader
Listener
www.myweb2.org
www.mywebtu.org
Activity
Visit www.nic.lk and study the steps to obtain .lk domain name.
5.3.3 File Transfer Protocol/FTP
These are the software used to transfer the website you have designed to the
selected web host according to the international standards. These can be purchased
or downloaded free from Internet.
Example -
1. Filezilla (https://filezilla-project.org)
2. SmartFTP (https://www.smartftp.com)
Since most of the web designing tools include file transfer facility as well,
another software is not needed. Further, the institutes which provide shared host
services too provide the facility of file transferring.
5.3.4 Internet Connection
Internet connection is essential for the three steps of publishing a website
– transferring, updating and path declaration. Internet connection is the medium
which connects the users with the web host.
A proper Internet service provider should be selected to get Internet
connection. Things such as the speed of the connection, charges, and maintenance
services should be considered here.
Some Internet service providers in Sri Lanka are as follows..
1. Sri Lanka Telecom
2. Lanka Bell
3. Mobitel
4. Dialog Axiata

5.3.5 Maintenance of Website
Regular maintenance is an essential factor for the success of a website. This
can be explained from several aspects.
1. Depending on the nature of the website, its content should be updated daily,
weekly or monthly. Not only should the content of the website be changed
here, but also the way it is presented, pictures, colours, shapes and other objects
should be changed. By maintaining a column on the Home Page to publish new
information, current changes can be updated instantly.
2. Harmful software like viruses, unauthorized access can create the website
malfunction. Hence, regular attention should be paid, while getting back up
time to time and proper security methods should be followed.
If there are new versions of the software used to design the website, website
should be updated accordingly. It is important for the security of the website.

Summary
In web designing, it is essential to design it with a structure and a pre design,
and organize it well with the proper content which suits the needs of the
users of the web site.
² Depending on the content, there are two types of web sites – static and
dynamic.
² HTML is the basic language used for web designing. Knowledge of this
language is essential to be a successful web editor. This makes writing
HTML codes easier.
² Simple web sites can be designed even without any knowledge of HTML
language, using the software such as web authoring tools and Content
Management Systems.
² Dynamic web sites can be designed using Content Management Systems.
² A suitable web host, domain name, and a file transfer protocol should be
selected to publish a designed web site.
² There should be a maintenance process for the success of a web site.

Information and Communication
Technology and Society
After studying this chapter, you will understand the following:
² Contribution of ICT to entertainment
² Ethical and legal issues in ICT
² Precautions related to ICT infrastructure protection
² Health and safety issues inherent in the use of ICT
6.1 ICT in entertainment
Society is driven towards various forms of entertainment facilities for
relaxation from everyday stress. However, most people prefer watching a film for
relaxation. Unlike in the past, film producers nowadays enjoy the advantage of
producing films of high quality with the use of ICT. Some of these modern facilities
that film producers enjoy are as described below:
i) 3D – three Dimensional
With the use of advanced technologies
producers can now make life look real on films
using three dimensional technology.
To view films using 3D technology the user
needs to use 3D spectacles available for the
purpose.
ii) Holographic image processing technology
A scene from a set shot in some place
is recorded on camera. Holographic image
processing technology is used to display this
image elsewhere. This technology is mostly
used with scenes depicting horror.

iii) Cartoon films
Cartoon films are popular among both
adults and the young. The 3D features
and the development of technology in
the relevant software have increased their
attraction. (Fig 6.3)
iv) Digital audio materials
The use of the computer is evident
with modern music and related editing.
Recording of songs, creating rhythm and
mixing are freely done using modern
software to entertain audiences (Fig 6.4).
Songs
recorded
this manner
can easily be
stored on compact
discs (CDs) and other digital media.
It is also possible to listen to or view
them using home theatre systems (Fig
6.5).

Figure 6.4 - Digital audio materials
Figure 6.5 - Home Theatre systems
v) Digital games
Digital games have
become very popular today.
Digital games can easily
be played on computers or
cell phones. Digital games
in both 3D and 4D (four
diamentional) are the most
popular today.

vi) Simulation games
Simulation games are based on an
everyday activity in a natural setting created
artificially.
Simulation games are mostly used with
training for sports activities, investigations,
planning, military
training, mercantile
activities, and miming.
Figure 6.7 - Simulation games
6.2 Problems associated with the use of ICT
It is possible for Information Communication Technologies (ICT) to be
mankind’s closest friend providing many facilities to make life comfortable. Yet,
with the use of ICT, mankind faces many unforeseen problems. These problems can
be related to the following:
Physical
problems

issues
Social issues
For free distribution
These issues and likely solutions are detailed in the following sub-section.
6.2.1 Legal issues
i) Data thefts -
Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
stolen from a computer or other device can be
considered as data theft.
E.g. - stealing or keeping flash drives, digital
camera, mobile phones that contain
personal names, telephone numbers,
photos etc. without permission or legal
rights.
Figure 6.9 - Data thefts
ii) Unauthorized access into computer systems -
It is possible to access computer systems unlawfully with the theft of or
manipulating user name and password of a computer. An organization's data
can easily be stolen in this manner.
iii) Intellectual property rights -
1. What are intellectual property rights?
Intellectual property usually relates to mind creations. Intellectual property
rights relate to an innovation or a completely new product from a person or an
organization currently. Such innovations or brand new products to enter the market
are the property of the first person or organization to develop and release the product.
They claim ownership to the innovation. It is their right to identify themselves as
the legal or lawful owners.
Presenting such products in the names of others or using such products
for other developments or sale of such products without the knowledge of the
first person or organization is illegal. Such claims belong to the category of stolen
intellectual property.
2. It is possible to obtain patent rights for protection of intellectual property.
A patent is a license issued by the State for innovations. To receive a patent
license the innovator must apply to the national office governing patents.
iv) Fraud
Computer fraud is any dishonest misinterpretation of fact intended to let
another to do or refrain from doing something which causes loss. The fraud will
result in obtaining a benefit by, for example:
170 For free distribution
For free distribution
• Altering in an unauthorized way (e.g. employees entering false data)
• Altering, destroying, suppressing or stealing output to conceal unauthorized
transactions
Identity theft: deliberate use of someone else's identity as a method to
gain a financial advantage. (e.g. someone using another's Personally Identifying
Information, NIC numbers, credit card numbers etc. without permission to commit
fraud.
6.2.2 Issues related to values
i) Plagiarism
Plagiarism is the act of stealing another’s
creative work and displaying it as one’s own.
Plagiarism is very common among users of
computers today with the stealing of data and
other related information from the Internet.
It is possible to use data and other
information collected from the Internet in
better accepted ways. Better accepted ways refer to the correct use of such
collected information without in any way harming the reputation of the correct
owner. This, can be done by,
Figure 6.10 - Plagiarism
1. citing - mentioning the rightful owner and his/her information.
2. quoting - the use of inverted commas (“…”) to identify a selected or borrowed
section.
referencing - the listing of resources from which the information was collected.
This is usually done at the end of an essay or article.
6.2.3 Physical and logical issues
Computers need to be used carefully. Careless use of computers is likely to
bring about both physical and logical issues.
Sudden power failures may lead to damaged computing devices. There may
be computer thieves. It is also possible to experience a complete network breakdown
with malware coming through the Internet. Environmental factors also contribute
towards physical damage to computers.
If so, how can computers be made secure to free ourselves from physical
and logical issues that are likely to arise?

¾ Physical Security
i) Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS)
In case of an electricity breakdown, there has to be some alternate
arrangement to supply power to the computer so that the network and the
documents face no harm. Here, the alternate arrangement to supply comes
with the battery contained in a UPS. This prevents interruption to the supply of
power to the computer.(Fig. 6.11).
Computer
Main Supply
Figure 6.11 - Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS)
ii) Hardware Firewalls
Hardware firewalls bought as a separate unit have now been built into
broadband routers. Hardware firewalls are essential especially with computer
networks connected to the Internet. A firewall protects a network from
unauthorized access to or from a network by filtering data that pass through it.
All messages entering or leaving a network pass through the firewall, which
examines each message and blocks those that do not security criteria (fig. 6.12)

iii) Controlled access through locked doors
Closed and locked doors are essential to ensure
security of a computer laboratory. Closed and locked
doors prevent or limit unlawful entry of people. It can also
improve safety of computer systems and other accessories
while protecting the information contained (Fig 6.13).
iv) CCTV
It is possible to install CCTV cameras inside a
computer laboratory and monitor movement from
outside or arrange for the day’s proceedings to be
recorded as a video clip for viewing later (Fig. 6.14).
Figure 6.13 - Controlled
access through doors
Figure 6.14 - CCTV
v) Surge protector
protector
surge
protects computers and other
accessories inside a laboratory
by controlling the voltage in
the power supply. The local
voltage supply for houses or
offices is 230 V. The surge
in situations
protector acts
where
supply
the power
exceeds this limit, to control
the destruction that could
happen to electronic devices
(Fig 6.15).
vi) Environmental factors
Environmental factors can affect the
proper function of a computer. Therefore,
it is important to maintain a laboratory or
a private computer in a safe environment
free from dirt, dust, moisture and the like
(Fig 6.16).

¾ Logical Security
i) Passwords
Passwords are used to secure data
stored in a computer. Passwords protect
unauthorized entry or use of a computer.
In using a password, it is advisable to mix
letters, symbols and numbers to make the
password stronger. (Fig. 6.17)
ii) Software Firewalls
Software firewalls are installed on a
computer (like any software) and can
be customized by the user. A software
firewall will protect a computer from
outside attempts to control or gain access
to it (Fig. 6.18).
iii) Backups
In the event of a failure of a computer
system, essential data and information
in the computer can be lost. Therefore,
a backup is essential towards securing
protection of data and information. A
backup can be maintained in an external
hard disk, CD, DVD, a flash drive or a
memory chip. It is also advisable to keep
such backups securely in another physical
location. (Fig 6.19)

6.2.4 Malicious software / Malware
i) The use of a computer involves various threats.
Malicious software/Malware or malicious codes
cause serious harm to computers and networks in
many ways. Some examples of such effects are
listed below:
² Decreased efficiency of the computer. (Improper
function, unnecessary attempts or re-start again and
again)
Inability to install other software
² Destruction or mal-function of software
² Weaken computer hardware
² Sabotage of computer networks
² Data theft and destruction
² Reduction of the storage capacity of the hard disk by storing unnecessary
Figure 6.20 - Malicious
software
documents and files.
Harmful software and resultant damage
A few types of harmful software and resultant damage are as described in the Table.
Harmful software
Computer Virus
Computer Worms
Resultant damage
Computer viruses gain entry into the computer through
a computer program and spread rapidly within the
computer causing enough harm. Viruses can enter a
computer through networks, a USB flash drive, external
devices like memory chips, or through e-mail. Viruses
enter the system as executable files. In other words the
viruses always remain active within the computer.
Computer worms also act similar to computer viruses.
Worms, however, are capable of acting and spreading
alone using e-mail attachments, false websites and
instant messages.

Spyware
Hijacker/ Browser
Hijacker
Phishing
Trojan Horse
The Trojan Horse is a harmful software based on the
Greek Trojan Horse constructed using wood. It presents
itself as harmless and enters the system without the
knowledge of the user. Trojan Horse spyware makes
the user uncomfortable by unnecessary opening up
windows, producing different desktops, deleting
documents and stealing data. Further, it allows other
harmful software to gain entry. Trojan enters computer
with e mail attachments. However, unlike computer
viruses and worms, the Trojan Horse does not spread
by itself.
Adware
The adware is displaying unnecessary notices on the
computer screen. Using these advertisements, adware
collects commercial information. Adware is not harmful
as other computer viruses but disturbs the user mentally.
Bots are derived from the word ‘robots’. Bots is harmful
software that functions on its own communicating
with other networks. Bots are used
to collect
personal information through Internet messages and
conversations.
Hijacker/Browser Hijacker is capable of misdirecting
a user to a different website through the Internet, to
collect information regarding trade, commerce and
advertisements. Hijacker, is similar to adware.
Phishing is the art of deceiving users to collect
information about bank accounts or electronic accounts.
E-mail is used for the purpose. Such mail is sent through
a popular organization or a friend together with a link
for access. With a click on the link, or by filling forms,
valuable information and cash deposits related to the
unsuspecting user get stolen.
Spam is unauthorized e-mail. Most often, spam relates
to advertisements about products or a mail from an
unknown person. The mail box can get filled with such
mail and make the user uncomfortable. Also, Spam may
collect e-mail addresses that can be used unlawfully for
frauds.

Safeguarding computer and a computer network from harmful software
Install a virus guard into the computer. Update the virus guard as is
necessary. Keep Guard/Shield/Auto Scan/Update always active.
² Be careful with the use of a USB memory. Check USBs for possible viruses
using anti virus software.
² Always install authorized software
Instead of an administrator account, maintain a user account
If the computer is connected to the Internet,
² Access secure websites. Check URL for verification.
² Select only secure websites for the download of software or other material.
² Before a download, check with a virus guard.
² Be careful with opening up e-mail. Where necessary use a virus guard
before a downloading and attachment. Do not click on suspicious links in
e-mail. Avoid opening suspicious e mails.
² Avoid suspicious advertisements or messages.
² Do not enter personal information without checking on security.
² Use firewall, virus guards, email filters to avoid the risk.
Some secure, popular virus guards to be installed on a computer are as follows.
² Avira Antivirus
² Avast Antivirus AVG Antivirus
² K7 Antivirus
² Digital Defender Antivirus
² Norman Antivirus

Agencies in Sri Lanka responsible for the security of information exchange
There is hardly any individual or an organization in Sri Lanka who/which
is not connected to the Internet. Over the last few years, unauthorized access into
social networks, financial websites has been observed over the world. Sri Lanka is
no exception. Therefore, the necessity for responsible agencies to secure Internet
access has arisen. This is also called ‘Cyber Security’.
Cyber security is not limited to e-mail, Internet solutions, or social
networks. They are useful for personal networks and operating systems (OS). Some
organizations responsible for cyber security are as follows.
Institution for Information Security of Sri Lanka
Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) is responsible
for the establishment of this institution in Sri Lanka. It provides facilities to various
organizations as listed below:
◦ Citizens
◦ Business establishments
State institutions.
ICTA, Sri Lanka Standards Bureau and the Sri Lanka Emergency
Computer Services have together organized to certify Information Security
Management Systems (ISMS) to ensure security of information. Individuals
and organizations can register for this.

6.2.5 Health issues related to use of Information Communication
Technology
² Ergonomics and health issues
Ergonomics is a word made with the use of two words in the Greek
Language. According to Greek Language “ergon” is job or action. “nomos” is law.
Therefore, the simple meaning to be collected from this word is:
“a job must be created to the comfort of the worker and the worker must not
be forced to adjust himself/herself to the work. If not, the worker will subject
himself/ herself to various tensions and illnesses.”
As of today, technology has become indispensable to mankind. Technology
and mankind are now interconnected as inseparable. Daily, the numbers using
technology keep increasing. As a result, technology related health issues too keep
increasing. Issues arise as a result of the continuous use of a computer for over four
hours at a stretch. Let us take a look at these health issues:
i) Musculoskeletal Problems
Non-stop use of a computer can bring about
pain in different muscles and bones of the human
system. The main reason for this is the wrong
posture taken with the use of the computer (Fig
6.21).
ii) RSI – Repetitive Stress Injury
Repetitive stress injury is the pain extending
from the shoulder to the fingers of the body. The
affected areas can show swelling and hardness
that brings out the pain. The difficulty to move
the mouse is a result of this pain. The cause of
the pain is incorrect posture (Fig. 6.22).

iii) CTS – Carpel Tunnel Syndrome (Fig.6.23)
Carpel tunnel syndrome is the feeling of
a numbness and pain in the fingers. The pain
arises due to the pressure exerted on the wrist.
Incorrect use of the key board and the mouse
or placing them in the incorrect positions are
reasons for the syndrome.
iv) CVS - Computer Vision Syndrome
Sticking to the computer continuously
for 6 to 7 hours can cause irritation of the
eyes and is identified as the Computer Vision
Syndrome. Dry eyes, redness in the eyes,
tearing, blurred vision, or pain in the head,
neck or back are symptoms of the discomfort.
(Fig.6.24)
v) Headache
Pressure on the muscles of the neck
and tiredness around the eyes usually cause
headaches to users of computers. (Fig. 6.25)
vi) Stress
Increase of activities in the working
environment due
technological
advancement cause stress, sleeplessness,
tiredness, lack of appetite etc. (Fig. 6.26)

How can these health problems be avoided?
Correct posture in the use of a computer, is essential. This is an essential
feature of ergonomics.
Correct posture in the use of a computer can help prevent many problems
associated with health. They are,
Figure 6.27 - Correct posture
1. Keeping the computer on a suitable table at eye level or a little lower.
2. The distance between the computer screen and the eye to be 18 – 28 inches
or 45 – 70 cm.
3. Keeping the user’s back straight against the back of the chair and keeping
shoulders relaxed.
4. Keeping legs vertical to the ground with the soles flat on the surface.
5. Keeping the mouse near the computer, keying in words lightly, moving wrist
as is necessary while keeping the keyboard straight at elbow level or lower.
To adhere to these movements:
² Adjust light on the computer to make the eyes comfortable
² Blink and take eyes off the screen on and off
² Take a break in between work, walk short distances
² Fix playtime sessions for children and direct them to other activities
² People using computers at work for 7 to 8 hours need to refrain from using
computers at home and maintain a relaxed mind.
Followers of these procedures are unlikely to face health issues.

These productions are made up of lots of harmful elements. Once the useful
life is over and discarded to the open environment without following the correct
procedure of disposal, it causes immense harm to humans and the environment as
well. Pollution of the environment effects man himself.

Health hazards and effects of Mercury
² Damage to brain cells
² Disruption of the nervous system
² Allergies on the skin
² Once inhaled, Mercury vapour can harm kidney, liver and central nervous
system
² Damage to DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) and chromosome
Further, the improper disposal of other e waste can cause swelling and
irritation on the body, nausea, stress, issues in blood veins and cancers.
some such harmful elements are,
Arsenic, Barium, Beryllium, Cadmium, Chromium, Dioxins, Lead, Mercury,
Selenium
Proper disposal of e waste
1. Reduce usage - Reduce unnecessary purchase by maintaining the existing
electronic devices
2. Reuse - Sell or donate old but working electronic devices without discarding
3. Recycle - Directing irreparable devices to an institute which recycle them
Activity
1. Visit the website of Central Environmental Authority of Sri Lanka
and identify the steps that are taken for e waste disposal.
2. Visit www.ewaste.lk, the institute dedicated to the proper disposal
of e waste in Sri Lanka. Prepare a booklet containing the services
provided by that institute and how these services are obtained.
6.2.7 Social issues related with ICT
Hey, Mr. Jhonson..
Mr. Jhonson?
i) Digital divide
Digital divide
is an economic and
social inequality due to the differences in
access to, ability to or use of Information
Communication Technology.
184 For free distribution
Figure 6.30 - Digital divide
For free distribution
Some of the reasons for the digital divide are as follows;
² Education
² Ability to use technology
² Affluence
² Industrial development
² Suburban
² Lack of education
² Inability to use technology
² Poverty
² Under industrial development
² Rural
Figure 6.31
² Education/Lack of education - Ignorance regarding the benefits of
Information Communication Technology and their use create differences
among individuals.
² Availability/Unavailability of technical know-how - There is little possibility
of connection between people who are knowledgeable of and make good use of
Information Communication technology with those who are totally ignorant of
Information Communication Technology or their uses.
² Affluence/Poverty - Even though, there is a need and the necessity to learn and
use ICT, afford ability becomes a matter for denied.
Industrial development/under industrial development - Industrialization of
a country is a reason for the use of Information Communication Technology.
Non-industrialization leads to a digital divide between countries.
² Suburban/Rural - Those leading urban lives are very busy and use Information
Communication Technology heavily. On the other hand, those leading simple
lives freely in rural areas simply do not care for the use of Information
Communication Technology. As a result, there arises a digital divide between
people.
ii) Digital Bridge - Digital bridge is forming connections among people avoiding
the digital divide. However, it is not possible to create a digital bridge by
providing each and everyone with a computer or a mobile phone. It is necessary
for people to acquire different technological products, get to know them and
learn how to use them effectively. Otherwise, the technology may become
meaningless and lose value.

How to form a digital bridge
Figure 6.32 - Digital Bridge
² Digital Literacy – Acquiring ICT Knowledge helps get over a digital divide.
Establishing places such as, Vidatha centres, Nenasala centres, Computer
Resource Centers to provide free use of computers or at low cost in different
parts of the country, can contribute towards overcoming a digital divide. To
promote the use of such centres, there need to be mobile publicity, delivery of
handouts and poster displays.
The benefits of digital literacy are as follows:
◦ Realization of the need of using ICT resulting in an urge to use it
◦ Helps overcome issues arising from the use of ICT as far as possible.
◦ Realizes the value of using the Internet for payment of bills, doing research
and collecting information about education, being aware of information
related to modern medicine and in applying for jobs.
² Supply of computers - Digital literacy is the foundation of the digital bridge.
Organizing the purchase of computers at easy concessionary rates can increase
the literacy rate in a country. It helps not only those anxious to gain digital
literacy but also other members of such families as well.
² Equal opportunities to dispel other financial difficulties - Making it possible
for everyone to access the Internet for free on a reasonable payment and clearing
all obstacles towards this process. Easy access to the Internet for everybody will
certainly help school children of all ages to collect necessary information for
their study purposes while making online education possible. It will also provide
opportunities for employment, observe market trends, exchange information
through social networks and related concerns.

² Participation of intermediaries - To make the digital bridge a success, it is
extremely necessary to get the support of various business concerns, people’s
associations and both public and private sector sponsorship and assistance.

iii) De-Skilling
Figure 6.33
De-skilling is also one of the effects of using ICT. (Fig. 7.33) Machinery or
automation has taken over skilled labour in places of work, driving people away
towards unemployment. It is easy to direct and maintain machinery at work.
However, the chances lost by skilled workers are enormous and have made them
helpless.
People and organizations have a wealth of knowledge collected over
the years. All this knowledge is wasted with the shift to machinery. Further, the
change does not allow for more knowledge and allows for lost opportunities. These
contribute to the disadvantages of automation.
A few such examples are discussed below:
² Machinery has taken over the industry replacing the talents of people.
² Libraries have been made to close down and jobs in the sector lost due to
the electronic books and magazines.
² Online learning through the distance mode has limited teacher resources.
² Health concerns are easily sorted out from home itself, cutting down the job
opportunities in laboratory services

Technology related employment opportunities
learnt
technology would,
in various ways deny us opportunities for
employment. (Fig. 15.34) Yet, technology
has, today, come to be an invaluable asset
to mankind. The main reason for this is the
availability of sufficient opportunities for
employment to those aware of ICT
Figure 6.34 - Technology related
employment opportunities.
Some high level, prosperous and well
paid employment opportunities for those with
knowledge of and the ability to handle ICT
are listed as follows. There are many more
opportunities other than for those listed.
² Computer programmer
² Computer/Information Systems Analyst
² Data Communications Analyst
² Database Programmers and Analyst
² Desktop/Applications Support Specialist
² Mobile Application Developer
² Network and Systems Security Specialist
² Network Managers and Administrator
² Software Engineer
² Technical Sales Specialists
² Technical Trainer
² Telecom manager
² Telecommunications Line Installer
² Website Developers
But of these, Software Engineers are the most in demand, locally and
globally. At present, Software Engineers employed abroad have come to be the
largest contributors towards foreign exchange earnings. This is due to the Software
Engineers being a highly paid employment opportunity. Therefore, being highly
educated about the development of software as well as ICT can certainly help you
win prosperity with highly paid employment opportunities.

6.2.8 Misuse of ICT to harm Society
i) Social Media
globally,
Social media could be introduced as
a fertile breeding ground towards connecting
associations
people
and grouping
towards
exchanging personal information and opinions
on related topics of interest. Given below are a
few services social media provide.
cultivating
like-minded people
² Promote one’s products profitably
² Blogs – Blogs are a shortened term for Web logs and refer to routing personal
diaries or magazines. These web logs are created for people to present their
daily experiences or about happenings that could cause harm to society. On
reading web logs others too can contribute opinions.
Figure 6.35 - Social Media
² Social media helps attract people using the Internet to one’s own website,
product detailing websites or blogs.
² Forum – Forums are routine discussion panels. Forum provides a good
opportunity for people to openly express common opinion. Forum is another
service from social media.
It has become increasingly possible for social media to connect people from
different parts of the globe share opinions, participate in lively discussions,
exchange images, video clips, and songs.
ii) Cyber crime
However, irresponsible use of social media has engendered misconduct in
society. This irresponsible use is identified as cyber crime. A few such acts are as
described.
² Uploading others’ images without permission
² Releasing unsuitable photographs or videos of women or young girls to the
Internet and making use of such images or videos to frighten, threaten or
blackmail
² Giving publicity to information that can harm a person’s reputation
² Misleading people with wrong information and images about others published
on the Internet to cause personal discomfort
² Using social media to give out false information and, thereby attract others to
finally destroy lives
² Using unfair means to gain access to others’ personal accounts and stealing
personal information.

Summary
² Technology is used in various ways to entertain.
² The use of the Internet brings up issues. They relate to legal, ethical and
physical issues, harmful software, environmental, health and the social.
² Patent rights help secure legal rights of intellectual property.
² To avoid physical issues interrupted power supply, hardware firewalls, closed
circuit TVs restricted entry through locked doors, surge protectors can be used.
² Logical issues are best met with passwords, making firewalls active and
maintaining backups.
² Harmful software can come in as computer viruses, computer worms, spyware,
bots, hijackers, phishing and spam.
It is safe to use antivirus software for protection against harmful software.
² Physical strain can be minimized with correct posture.
² Electronic waste needs to be disposed of correctly to avoid unnecessary harm
to the environment.
² Digital divide is a social issue arising from ICT.
² Digital bridge can help avoid digital divide.
² Those quite knowledgeable about ICT have an advantage over others in well
ICT contributes towards elimination of inherent talent.
