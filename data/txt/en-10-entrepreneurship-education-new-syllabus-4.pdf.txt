5.1 Importance of studying the business environment
Business environment can be defined in simple terms as all the factors and forces
that influence the business activities positively and negatively, from within the
business and from the outside.
Business environment keeps on changing. If one identifies these changes and
responds appropriately to them, he/she can run a business easily. In addition, this
provides important business related benefits for an entrepreneur. At present, Sri
Lanka has a market-oriented economy. By studying the changes in the Sri Lankan
business environment, many creative business ideas or opportunities can be
generated in the different sections of the environment.
Examples :-
V Tendency towards using computer technology, communication
technology and e-commerce.
V Environmental tourism and the increased number of tourists
(both local and foreign)
V Opportunities in the construction sector
While entrepreneurs contribute to create a business culture of quality, business
environment provides a good foundation to ensure the survival of entrepreneurs. In
order to attain business objectives, it is necessary to study the business environment
with care.
Identifying the favourable and unfavourable influences of the business environment
is useful to achieve the business goals and objectives. The opportunities and strengths
arising through the environmental factors are advantageous to the business, while
the weaknesses and threats are disadvantageous.
The entrepreneur should identify the favourable influences and use them to strengthen
the business further. Similarly, he should also identify unfavourable influences and
take steps to minimize them. It is the factors of the business environment that pave
the way for the entrepreneur to make correct decisions.

Business environment can be divided into two principal parts, to make it easier to
study. These are
V Internal environment
V External environment
Internal environment
All the factors which are found within
the business and which influence the
functioning of the business organization

environment. The major factors of the
internal environment are as follows:
referred

environment is much broader than the
internal environment. Factors of the
external environment are given below:
V Micro environment
V Demographic environment
V Economic environment
V Political and legal environment
V Technological environment
V Natural environment
V Social and cultural environment
V Global environment
Studying the factors of the external
environment helps to identify various
business opportunities as well as
potential threats that the business will
have to face.
Figure 5.2
5.3 Internal environment and its influence
You already know that internal environment factors of an organization influence
its business activities and that they help to identify the strengths and weaknesses
of the business. Strengths can be used to achieve success in business. Getting rid
of the weaknesses will also lead a business towards success. What should be noted
here is that the influence of internal environmental factors can be controlled by the
business itself. Let us examine each of these factors separately, together with the
impact they have upon the business.
For free distribution
Owners
The persons who provide capital for the business are the owners.
Owners who are financially sound are a strength for a business. They can provide
the resources necessary for business activities without any hindrance. When the
owners are well reputed people with experience in business, it is highly favourable
for the business. On the other hand, weak financial capacity and wrong decision
making can have a negative impact on the business.
Employees
Employees are the persons who are engaged in the business activities of the
organization.
They contribute their mental or physical labour for the business activities and earn
salaries and wages in return. Employees who like their organization and believe in it
are a strength for a business. Well trained and knowledgeable employees can conduct
the business activities at an optimum level. When the employees are inefficient and
untrained, it can disrupt the functioning of the organization. Employee appraisal,
training and incentives are ways of minimizing employee weaknesses.
Managers
It is the managers who manoeuvre the human and physical resources of the
business and lead the way to attain the goals and objectives of the organization.
The success of business activities depends on the knowledge and skills of the
managers. While talented and creative managers are a strength, even one wrong
decision made by managers can be unfavourable for the business. Therefore,
not having talented, creative, trustworthy and committed managers is a definite
weakness in an organization.
Resources
Resources refer to all physical and financial resources that are relevant for
the business activities.
When a business has sufficient amounts of resources (such as machinery, buildings,
vehicles and money), and when the latest knowledge is being used in the business,
it is a strength for the entrepreneur. Lack of resources will hinder the attaining of
business goals. Weak time management too is a weakness.
The strengths, identified through the internal environment, should be developed
further; and measures should be taken to minimize the weaknesses.

04. Managers with different skills are hired by the organization.
05. Employees do not come to work on time.
06. Products of good quality are offered at a reasonable price.
07. Business premises are not maintained well.
08. New technology is used.
09. A loan has been taken at a high rate of interest.
10. There is a flexible plan for the organization.
11. No changes are made to go with the times.

13. The different skills and abilities of the employees have been identified.
14. There are good relations among the departments of the organization.
15. Research is done for the development of the business.
5.4 External environment and its influence
You already know that the external environment includes the factors and forces
which influence a business from the outside and which cannot be directly controlled
by the business. When opportunities are fully exploited and threats are resolved,
business goals can be easily accomplished. Let us examine the factors of the
external environment and their impact.
Micro environment
Out of the factors of the external environment, the micro environment
contains the forces that are the closest to the business.
For free distribution
Forces of the micro environment are customers, suppliers, competitors, those who
offer similar products and those who wish to enter the business field in future.
Though these are not fully controllable, the entrepreneur has some degree of control
over them.
Examples :-
When there are a lot of customers who have the ability to buy goods and
services, it is an opportunity.
When competitors change their strategies, it is a threat for an entrepreneur.
Demographic environment
The population of a country and the factors associated with their lives are
included in the demographic environment.
The market for goods and services is organized on the basis of the demographic
environment. When the population grows, the market becomes broader, and more
goods and services will have to be produced. Forces such as population growth
rate, population’s composition and age-wise distribution etc have an impact upon
businesses.
Examples :-
When there is a greater population of children, it is a good opportunity for
toy manufacturers.
When there is a greater population of adults in a country, it is a threat for
the businesses producing goods for children.
Economic environment
Factors that determine the economic conditions of a country are taken under
the economic environment.
Factors of the economic environment, such as fluctuation of interest rates, changes
in the price levels, rate of employment, salary level, foreign exchange rates etc
can have favourable or unfavourable impacts upon business activities. It is useful
for an entrepreneur to be aware of the opportunities and threats that can arise out
of these factors.
Examples :-
When the rate of employment is high, people earn a better income,
which can broaden the market. This is an opportunity.
A rise in the interest rate for loans is a threat for businesses.
For free distribution
Political and legal environment
State economic policies and the laws relevant for their implementation are
referred to as the political and legal environment.
International treaties, foreign trade, state policies and laws are the factors of the
political and legal environment. They have much influence over the success of
business activities as well as over the economic development of the country.
Examples :-
When the country enters into international agreements, it opens up
opportunities for the local exporters.
When the government raises the tax rates, it is a threat for businesses.
Scientific and technological environment
The use of scientific methods and new technology, as well as the impact
of research upon business activities, is considered as the scientific
and technological environment.
New scientific discoveries, research and development, new goods and services,
and information and communication are factors of the scientific and technological
environment. With the development of technology, new products enter the market.
When new goods and services are introduced, some products may go out of the market.
Examples :-
Internet provides an opportunity for businesses to enter the foreign market.
Due to the use of digital cameras, there is less need of studios. This is a
threat for studio owners.
Natural environment
The influence of natural phenomena upon business activities is considered
as the natural environment.
It is from the natural environment that the raw material and resources are obtained
for businesses. We can identify natural resources and natural disasters as the factors
of the natural environment. Some of the valuable resources of this environment
have been used for business activities while there are some that have not. If
natural resources are used in a manner that does not harm the environment, many
opportunities can be gained. On the other hand, natural disasters can prove a threat
to businesses as well.
For free distribution
Example :-
The demand for herbal products made from indigenous herbs is a
business opportunity.
Natural disasters such as droughts and floods are a threat to
agricultural activities.
Social and cultural environment
It is the attitudes, values and life style of the people that are included in the
social and cultural environment.
Traditions, values, beliefs and changes in the life style are taken as the factors of
the social and cultural environment. In a country where there are people of different
races, religions and cultures, it is important to be aware of the opportunities and
threats that may come up for businesses. In addition, social and cultural values
should be upheld through business activities.
Example :-
Foreigners come to watch the annual Kandy Perahara. This is a
business opportunity.
When the number of vegetarians increases, it is a threat for
manufacturers of meat-related products.
Global environment
There is a tendency for the countries of the world to forego their borders and
be linked together. This is referred to as the global environment.
Example :-
Greater possibility of entering the international market is an
opportunity.
The local market gets flooded with products manufactured in other
countries. This is a threat for local businesses.
Opportunities, which arise through the factors of the external environment, should
be made use of. At the same time, steps should be taken to minimize the threats.

5.6 The economy of Sri Lanka
Nature of the economy of Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka has been a prosperous country from the past. The land was ruled by kings,
and the people fulfilled their needs and wants through an agricultural life style. With
the later arrival of the Westerners, the economy of Sri Lanka faced various changes.
In this context, plantation industry can be identified as a mile stone. Following this,
there have been major changes in the economic, social, administrative, business
and industrial sectors of the country.
After obtaining the independence in 1948, various economic plans have been
implemented for the economic development of the country. Businesses have been
organized under the three main sectors of agriculture, industry and services. With
the development of technology, businesses have introduced many new products into
the market. Services and facilities such as high ways, electricity, communication,
insurance, money, banking etc have spread throughout the country. As the industrial
sector expanded, the contribution of the services sector has increased very fast. The
principal aim in the present day economy is to enter the foreign market (in addition
to the local market) in order to reach an overall economic development.
At present, the principal business sectors in Sri Lanka are the following.
5.7 Principal business sectors in Sri Lanka
01. Primary sector
Under this sector, resources are extracted from the natural environment in their
original state. In other words, resources of the natural environment are put to
use without changing them in any manner. Given below are some examples for
businesses of the primary sector:
Agriculture and farming (cultivating flowers, timber industry, poultry etc)
Fisheries (fishing in the sea and in fresh water)
Mining (gem industry, lime stone industry, etc)
For free distribution
02. Secondary sector
Here, natural resources obtained from the natural environment are subjected to
change in shape, quality or colour, and used for consumption or for other business
purposes. That is to say, this is the sector that includes the manufacturing industries.
There are two sub sections of this sector, namely:
Manufacturing (cement, shoes, books etc)
Construction (buildings, bridges, etc)
03. Tertiary sector
Businesses that provide the services needed for the people as well as for business
purposes are considered under the tertiary sector. The following are some examples:
Trade (retail, wholesale, etc)
Services required for trade (banking, insurance, transportation, etc)
Activity 05
Prepare a list of businesses in your area. Then categorize them as primary, secondary
or tertiary.
5.8 Abundant resources in Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka is an island with a land area of 65610 square kilometres, and rich with
a proud historical and cultural heritage. There are many resources in our country
which are being used by entrepreneurs as well as many that have not yet been
exploited. Some of these resources are man-made, while some are obtained from
the natural environment. Resources can be divided into two main types, as
V Human resources
V Non-human resources

activities are considered as
human resource. It is through the
human resource that one can take the
maximum use of all other resources.
The high literacy and skill for learning
are some of the special characteristics
of the human resource in Sri Lanka.
The uniqueness of our human resource
should be identified before exploiting it
for business opportunities.
Studying these differences will enable
an entrepreneur to use the human
resource in a new and creative manner,
which will create new business
opportunities.
Figure 5.3
Non-human resources
Here we will discuss about the resources that are non-human, including natural
resources and man-made resources, which are used for business purposes. When
compared to other countries, Sri Lanka possesses some unique resources.
An entrepreneur can study the environment and identify the resources which are
abundant in Sri Lanka. It is his/her duty to look for such resources, and use them
with maximum efficiency to generate creative business opportunities. Given below
are some examples for such resources.

V Natural resources -
Water, water falls, rivers, beaches,
fertile soil, mountains, fish, expanses
of shallow water and lagoons, low
lands, rain forests, coral reefs, eco
systems with high bio diversity, etc

Agricultural activities
Sri Lanka has an age-old food tradition which is
well-developed. Therefore we can create many
new business opportunities through agriculture.
Agricultural products such as vegetables, fruits,
rice, grains and export crops can be grown using
carbonic fertilizer, and it can be a successful
enterprise. Processing, packaging and preserving
agricultural products, as well as offering them to
the foreign market, are some other possibilities.
What is important here is letting go of the
traditional agricultural products and thinking as
entrepreneurs.
Examples :-
Discovering new methods of
preserving the harvest
Creating alternative products using
those new methods
Encouraging tourism based
agriculture
Tourism industry
Sri Lanka is rich in resources of natural beauty
that can be used to boost tourism. In addition, we
have man-made resources such as airports, ports,
highways, city renovation, etc. Developments in
information technology can also be exploited to
create new business opportunities in tourism.
Ayurvedic medicine
Nowadays there is an increased demand for
indigenous medicines. This demand can be
fulfilled with the ayurvedic treatment methods
and medicines which we already have. It is up
to the entrepreneur to plan creative business
opportunities based on the traditional field of Sri
Lankan medicine. Such opportunities could cater
to both local and foreign markets.
