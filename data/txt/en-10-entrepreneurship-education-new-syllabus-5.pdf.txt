6.1 Important decisions that should be taken before starting
a business
A business can be generally defined as any economic activity carried out for the
purpose of fulfilling human needs and wants. Accordingly businesses produce
goods and services to fulfill the needs and wants of people or organizations using
the limited resources available in the environment. This ensures that businesses
exist based on the needs and wants of the people or organizations.
Anyone has the opportunity to start a business to offer products or services to the
market. This should be done wisely and very carefully. Resources including money,
own labour, time, self image have to be deployed when starting businesses. In order
to make the businesses initiated as above successful, there are few decisions that
should be taken in to consideration.
Decisions that should be taken when starting a business
01. To which extent the person can dedicate for the business?
02. On which product or service the business is based?
03. Who is the target consumer?
04. What is the nature of the competition?
05. Are earnings adequate?
06. How to find the required capital?
07. How to start the business, individually or with partners?
08. What is the nature of the business location?
09. What will be the benefits the business generates to the society?
Let’s discuss each of these decisions further.
01. To which extent the person can dedicate for the business?

If such activities are to be carried out fruitfully, entrepreneur should entirely dedicate
his effort and time to the business. Similarly the entrepreneur has to engage in the
daily affairs and social relationship activities. Hence, whether the entrepreneur is
capable of balancing his effort and time to make the business a success should be
decided.
02. On which product or service the business is based?
One of the key factors which affect the success of the business is the product or
the service offered to the market. That should,
Example :-

Have unique/distinctive features compared to other products and
services
03. Who is the target consumer?
This emphasizes the target group of consumers
to whom the product or the service of the
entrepreneur is offered. In other words this is the
total of current consumers (who are currently
consuming
the potential
consumers (who may consume the product in
the future). Products and services can be offered
targeting different consumer groups and their
likes/ dislikes and the purchasing power should
be inquired.
the product) and

04. What is the nature of the competition?
Competition is an essential feature of the today’s market. Sum of individuals or
organizations who offer different products and services to the market to satisfy
a certain need or a want are considered as competitors. It is important to get an
understanding of the current competitors and the potential competitors who may
enter the market in the future when assessing the competition.
Example :-
V There are many organizations which offer different products and
services mentioned below to satisfy the need of cleaning clothes.
V Washing soaps
V Washing powder
V Washing liquids
V Laundry service
05. Are earnings adequate?
The entrepreneur starts the business expecting a return. It should be sufficient to
cover all the expenses of the business.
That is,
V Earnings should be capable of settling the expenses like,
V cost of purchasing
V taxes
V rentals and
V salaries
Similarly
V Earnings should be adequate enough to,
V provide a sufficient profit to the owners
V reinvest in the business for future improvements
06. How to find the required capital?
Generally, an initial capital is required to start a business. The capital requirement
differs depending on the nature of the business. Some businesses can be initiated
with a less capital while some require a considerable investment even at the
beginning. There can be different alternatives to fulfil that capital requirement.

Sources of capital for a new entrepreneur
V Own savings
V Deploying own assets or selling them
V Relatives and friends
V Bank loans and leasing

Even though there are alternative sources of capital, attention should be paid to
their advantages and disadvantages

07. How to start the business, individually or with partners?
The entrepreneur can start the business individually or he/she can get the involvement
of a member of the family or other external party. The most appropriate method
should be selected after considering the advantages and disadvantages to the
entrepreneur of starting a business individually or as a partnership. You will get the
opportunity to further study this later.
08. What is the nature of the business location
The critical factor which affects the success of certain businesses is the business
location. The location of the business has to be decided by considering the following
factors.
V Number of customers and their dispersion
V Ease of getting resources
V Convenience of acquiring labour
V Convenience of getting the infrastructure facilities like electricity,
water, and communication
V Facilities which can be provided to the consumers (e.g.: parking

6.2 Market Entry of the new entrepreneur
A business should enter the market with a good plan if it is to be successful
irrespective of whether it is a small scale or large scale business. Four alternative
methods are available for a new entrepreneur to enter the market.
1. Offering an existing product or a service to the existing market
2. Offering an existing product or a service to the a new market
3. Offering a new product or a service to the existing market
4. Offering a new product or a service to a new market
Since there are advantages and disadvantages of these alternative entry methods,
it is necessary to evaluate them.
01. Offering an existing product or a service to the existing market

method. But the risk of this option is
high. The reasons are that there are lots
of competitors who offer the products
to the market and consumers are used
to the products of them. As a result the
new entrepreneur has to incur a greater
cost and put a considerable effort
to attract the consumers for his/her
product. Hence the cost of attracting
consumers
increases while earning
profits becomes uncertain.

02. Offering an existing product or a service to the a new market
There can be a group of consumers who
are not used to consume an existing
product or a service in the market.
By offering an existing product or a
service to them, the entrepreneur can
enter the market. In other words, under
this method a new customer base is
created by offering the product to non-
consumers, non consuming region or a
country.
Example :-

and offices
Offering the product during a period or at a time when the competitors
do not sell the products (fruit cultivation during off season)
Though there are benefits under this method due to less number of competitors,
certain risks prevail. Out of them, unfamiliarity of the new consumers with the
product is a prominent risk.
03. Offering a new product or a service to the existing market
Many entrepreneurs enter the market
through this method. It is possible to
enter the market by making a certain
change to an existing product or a
service and adding a new kind of utility.
Even though there is a risk due to the
large number of competitors, acting
strategically will help to win the market
since there is a substantial customer
base.

04. Offering a new product or a service to a new market
The main advantage for the entrepreneur
who enters the business under this
method is having no competitors.
Hence, the entrepreneur can achieve
greater success by acquiring 100%
of the market share within a definite
future. Yet there is a high risk since
the consumer is totally unaware of the
product. Further the target consumers
are not precisely identified. Success
can be achieved by accurately studying
the market, working according to a
plan and increasing the consumer awareness.

6.3 Successful entry strategies for a new business
Among the above mentioned alternatives, whatever the approach followed to enter
the market, the entrepreneur falls back amidst severe competition if appropriate
strategies are not practised. As mentioned earlier, though many new businesses are
initiated, only a few of them become stable, long lasting businesses. The reason is
the imperfections of the strategies followed.
A person who starts a business should pay attention to suitable strategies for
attracting the consumers to his/her products. Some such suitable strategies are
discussed below.
01. Being a distinctive/unique new
product or a service
02. Product differentiation
03. Market gap/space
04. Innovation
Figure 6.6
01. Offering a distinctive/unique new product or a service
If the product of the entrepreneur is unique and different in quality, size, packaging
and other utilities compared to the competitive products available in the market ,
that can be considered as a successful entry strategy.
Example :-
V A pen with ink on one end and correction fluid on the other end.
V A soap having a packaging which can be used as a soap box
02. Offering the product using differentiation
Product differentiation is an attempt to differentiate the own product from that of
the competitors.

Price of certain goods does not affect for a change in the demand of that product.
In such a situation, the most appropriate mode of attracting customers is to make
changes to the product. Hence product differentiation is a good entry strategy for
an entrepreneur.
Example :-
Milk powder is offered to the market under different packages like;
jambo pack
budget pack
economy pack
sachet pack
03. Offering products to the market gap
Market gap indicates that there is a group of customers in the market whose needs
and wants are not satisfied.
Though large firms offer products targeting a large consumer base, they ignore
the small group of consumers having distinctive needs. Hence entrepreneurs can
effectively focus on such special markets which emerge due to the changes in the
environment.
Example :-
There is a group of people in the society who have retired from
government and private sectors. They have their own characteristics
which are unique to them. Entrepreneurs can capture this market by
satisfying their needs through the specifically designed offerings
including radio channels, television channels, caring homes, senior
citizen accounts and tours to Dhambadiva.
04. Innovation
Innovation simply means doing something new. A product or a service can be
innovated from the beginning of the production process till it reaches the hands
of the consumer and even when providing after sales services. Through that the
utility of a product is changed.
A skillful entrepreneur can introduce innovations for the following opportunities.
