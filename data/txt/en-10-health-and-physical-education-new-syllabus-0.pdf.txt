Let us build a healthy society
Well organized preventive and curative health services, good social and economic
backgrounds and a clean environment are essential for having a healthy society.
while it is important that people should be free from disease and deformity their
physical, mental and social well-being are equally important.
In our previous lessons, we learnt how to improve and maintain our health.
Now it is time for us to go further and study what is meant by 'total health' and the
factors that influence it. We will also learn about identifying suitable life styles
to maintain total health, challenges to currend health conditions and ways of
overcoming them. This knowledge will help us build a healthy society.
Concept of total health
According to the World Health Organization (WHO),
Total health is not only being free from diseases and disabilities, but also having
physical, mental, social and spiritual well-being.
Thus, 'total health' does not merely mean being free from diseases and disabilities.
The factors influencing total health.
Total health depends on many factors. By engaging in physical educational activites
one can develop all four constituents of total health, namely, physical, mentel, social
and spiritual well-being. By engasing in exercises and sports one can improve the
health as well as the efficienacy of various systems in the body. Similarly, engaging
in team sports help in the improvement of the mental, social and spiritual aspect, of
one's personality.
Although one can change his or her behaviour and certain elements in his/her
physical environment, factors such as health services and effects of urbanization
depend on the national policies of the local or central government. We have a
responsibility and a duty to change national policies according to the prevailing
needs of the society.

avoiding alcohol & drugs, good
interpersonal relationships, being free
from stress.
Suitable life style to maintain total health
Our behaviour and life style has a great influence on our health. A few important
life styles that will help to achieve total health are given below:
1. Good eating habits
2. Active life style and exercise
3. Maintaining an appropriate BMI
4. Adequate sleep and rest
5. Leading a simple life style
6. Stress management
7. Avoiding alcohol, drugs and smoking
8. Following accepted rules and regulations.
Good eating habits, an active life style and exercise help to maintain the BMI
within a healthy range. This helps to improve one's physical and mental fitness as
well as to reduce one's vulnerability to non-communicable diseases.
1. Good eating habits
Correct proportions of food from the following groups should be included in the
diet to get the required nutrients to maintain total health.
• Grains (cereals) and tubers (yams)
• Vegetables
• Fruits
• Fish, meat, eggs and grains
• Milk and other dairy products
• Seeds rich in fat
(Good eating habits are explained in detail in chapter seven.)
2. Active life style and exercise
One can prevent getting non-communicable diseases like cancer, diabetes, high
blood pressure, heart disease, stroke and maintain mental and physical fitness by
engaging in daily physical exercises. Adults and children should engage in daily
physical exercise for 30 and 60 minutes respectively. Walking briskly, running,
cycling, swimming or engaging in some sport are few things one can do. Apart
from these regular formal exercises, we can get exercise also by walking to nearby
places instead of travelling in a vehicle, taking the stairs instead of using the lift or
escalator, engaging in day to day house hold activities like cleaning, gardening etc.
Not only during our youth, but at every age one should maintain an active life
style and engage in regular exercise. With age it is important to engage in regular
exercise and lead an active life style to maintain physical fitness.
3. Maintaining appropriate Body Mass Index (BMI)
We have learnt, in lower grades how to calculate the BMI.
Body Mass Index
Body weight (Kg)
Height (m)  Height (m)
The BMI of a child varies according to the age and gender. BMI values in the 5-19
years age group is interpreted using a chart specific to each sex. BMI of a child
should be maintained within the green zone.
Chart 1.1
Chart 1.2

Nutritional status of the individual is determined by the position where the BMI
lies as given below.
Below -2SD
- (orange colour)
- wasting
Between -2SD to +1SD
- (green colour)
- normal level
Between +1SD to +2SD
- (light purple colour)
- overweight
Above +2SD
- (dark purple colour) - obesity
BMI threshold values in adults do not vary with age and gender. The table below
gives the ranges of international and asian BMI values for different nutritional
status.

Being overweight and obese increase the risk of developing diabetes, high blood
pressure, strokes, cancer and heart disease. Such individuals should reduce the
intake of energy rich food and engage in more daily exercises.

Activity
1. Measure your height & weight and calculate your BMI.
Plot it on the gender specific graph.
2. According to your position on the BMI chart, decide your nutritional level.
4. Adequate sleep and rest
After a hard day’s work sleep is important. Sleep is vital for the body to get the
required rest. It is vital for the growth and development of the body. Sleep also
helps us to retain what we learnt when awake. An adult needs about 8 hours of
sleep daily while children need more. Inadequate sleep leads to poor concentration,
sleepiness, irritability and tiredness during day time and reduces efficiency.
5. Simple life style
A simple life is a way of life that has to be decided by one's self. Being content
with a modest life and not chasing after luxuries is a very important factor. Another
important factor is to reducing belongings to a minimum and managing your
requirements with whatever you have. This concept was promoted by Mahatma
Ghandi at the beginning of the last century.
6. Stress Management
Stress is how one reacts to a challenge. This differs from person to person.
While one may get stressed over an examination another may not. When we
encounter a challenging situation, our level of stress increases and this will
help us to face the encountered challenge effectively in day to day life. Stress
will also improve our efficiency some times. Long term stress could affect our
health adversely. It could lead to poor mental and physical states. Looking for
reasons for stress, expressing feelings, looking at the problems in different
ways, proper time management are some ways that could be adopted to relieve
stress . Adopting a simple life style helps to lead a stress free life. (The reasons
for stress and ways to overcome them are explained in length in chapter 9.2)
7. Avoiding alcohol, drugs and smoking
Use of alcohol, drugs and tobacco is a great hazard to both physical and mental
health. It also hinders social well-being and financial status. Research has shown
that about 50% of the income of lower income families is spent on alcohol, drugs
and tobacco.
Youth are attracted to abuse illicit substances. This is due to the image that has
been portrayed about its use. Companies use attractive advertisements creating a
good image for these products through the media. For example, using high profile
figures such as althletes at public gatherings like games, incorporating scenes that
use cigarettes and alcohol in movies are subtle ways used to promote and build an
image of the product. Such advertisements as well as scenes in movies are banned
in Sri Lanka for public viewing.
Peer group influence too, plays a major role in starting to use alcohol, drugs and
tobacco.
Measures that can be taken to prevent the use of drugs, alcohol and smoking:
Increasing the price of cigarettes and alcohol
• Limiting the places selling them
• Advertising of alcohol and cigarettes to be banned
• Taking effective legal action on the use and trafficking of illicit drugs
• Conducting awareness programmes for the public on adverse effects of smoking
on health and socioeconomic effects
• Change the image that the society has placed on these items
e.g: pictorial depiction of harmful effects of smoking on the cover of
the carton
• Cigarettes and alcohol to be sold only to adults
8. Obeying laws
There are laws, rules and regulations introduced to enhance and protect public
safety, public health and the general well-being of the public. You must always
observe them and resist any temptation to act in breach of them. Respecting such
laws, rules and regulations and norms is beneficial to everyone. During adolescence
there could be peer pressure to break rules and regulations. For example, using seat
belts in a vehicle and wearing helmets are few rules that are taken lightly by youth.
Not following these rules could result in majar casualties including death. Driving
at high speeds and driving under the influence of alcohol are two main reasons for
road accidents. Although smoking is prohibited in public places, some break this
law and create a health hazard to others as well.
Promiscuous sexual conduct can expose one to the risk of contracting sexually
transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies. Due to illegal abortions a large
number of females get infections, become sub-fertile and even die.
Challenges to maintaining total health
As we have mentioned before an individual’s health depends on his or her
genes and behaviour, the physical, social and economic factors affecting him
or her and the health available services. In this section we will find out how
physical, social and economic factors affect our health.

Economy and the level of education
Figure 1.2
A country’s economic status and the level of education of the public affect the
health status of a country. This has a great impact on its economic development.
Factors such as income, nutrition, clean drinking water, sanitation, spacious and
well ventilated houses and availability of medical facilities are important for health.
These factors are determined by the economic status of the individual as well as
the country.
The level of education of the community has a direct impact on health. Sri Lanka
is a middle income country but it has a very low infant death rate and high life
expectancy rate.
Health services and diseases
Figure 1.3
The other important factor to maintain good health standards in Sri Lanka is the
high quality of medical services that are provided free of charge by the government
of Sri Lanka through a network of hospitals and M.O.H. offices across the country.
The national immunization programme, school health services, maternity clinics
and the services provided by public health midwife (P.H.M.) and public health
inspector (P.H.I.) have helped to improve the health status of Sri Lankans. The
certification of a heathy environment when building a home can be a part of the
programme.
Due to the development of medical science, the health services have improved
and infectious desease are under control but bad eating habits and inadequate
exercise have led to an increase in obesity. This has resulted in a rapid increase
of non-communicable disease such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease
and strokes. The elderly population in Sri Lanka is also increasing. Due to these
reasons the health service is facing a huge challenge at present.
Internally displaced due to war and natural disasters
Figure 1.4
Many obstacles arise when providing health services in areas affected by war or
natural disasters. These situations have a great impact on the mental health and
social well-being of those who are internally displaced.
Competitive life style and interpersonal relationship
The present education system and job opportunities are very competitive. Due to
this reason people have no time to enjoy life and the leisure time has been reduced,
leading to increased stress. Due to lack of time family bonds and inter personal
relationships have weakened.
Development of technology
Technological innovations have helped human kind immensely. Innovations in the
medical field are of a very high standard. Although technology has made our daily
life comfortable and easy, it also has made us lazy. We hardly exert ourselves and
as a result, non-communicable diseases are increasing.
Influence of the media and the concept of global village
The media and the internet have a great impact on our behaviour and beliefs.
Commercial advertisements may at times have a bad influence on us. Unhealthy
food advertisements can have a bad influence on children. Watching television,
using computers and spending more time at computer games can adversely affect
the mental and physical health of both children and adults.
The media can be used for the betterment of human kind. It can be used to make
the public aware of diseases, unhealthy lifestyles and bad practices happening in
the society.
Figure 1.5
With the development in the fields of transport, media and the internet the whole
world has become a global village. So both good and bad lifestyles spread across
the world within a short span of time,
Influence of the tourism industry
Tourism helps to build ties between countries and nations, generates foreign
exchange and improves infrastructure. Tourism can also have negative effects such
as environmental pollution, increase in adverse situations like prostitution and
spread of sexually transmitted diseases, circulation of illicit drugs and damage the
culture.
Population density
Figure 1.6
Population density is a measurement of population per unit area of land. Diseases
related to respiratory and digestive systems and stress have become common due to
the increase in the population density.
Activity
• Make a list of commercial advertisements that have an impact on health which
are telecasted over television, broadcasted over radio and published in the
newspaper during a period of one week.
• Explain the impact on health through those advertisements.
Actions to be taken to overcome challenges faced in
achieving total health
1. Uplifting the educational level of the people
e.g: Making health education compulsory
2. Strengthening both preventive and curative (treatment) sectors of health service.
3. Identifying problems that are arising due to competitive lifestyles, technology,
influence of media, concept of global village and take steps to increase public
awareness about these and ways of overcoming them.
4. Uplifting the economic status of the people.
5. Identifying effects of increase in population density on health and finding
solutions for them.
E.g: Increasing the staff in the health service sector.
Introducing housing projects with adequate sanitary facilities.
6. Organizing awareness programmes, for school children and the community in
areas fuequented by tourists, on possible health and social problems that would
arise in these areas and find solutions and be prepared to face them.
7. Uplifting the welfare of the displaced people.
8. There must be government policy planning focused on maintaining total health.
Summary
Genetic composition, behavioural patterns, social and economic background,
physical environment and health services are the main factors that affect our
health. Factors that are important to achieve total health are good food habits,
active life and regular exercise, maintaining appropriate BMI, adequate sleep and
rest , adopting a simple life style, avoiding drugs, alcohol and smoking, reducing
stress, abiding by rules, regulations and socially accepted norms. Economic status,
level of education, health service, war and displacement, competitive life styles,
interpersonal relationships, technology, media, diseases, changes in family bonds,
concept of global village and tourism industry are the main challenges to health.
We have to overcome these challenges in order to achieve a high standard of health
in society.
