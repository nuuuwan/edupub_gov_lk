it only convenient or are there any negative effects associated with its use?
Undoubtedly, the Internet has many positive effects as Internet search

In addition it has paved the way for some of the most effective means of
communication among people, including email chat and Skype. It has also

customers without meeting them.
In addition to these, it has also allowed the exchange of ideas and materials
among scientists, university professors, and students. It has also provided
servers, resource centers and online tools for their research and scholarly
activities. Moreover, millions of books, journals and other material have
been made available online through the Internet which have enabled people
to learn all sorts of new things.

things, such as medical or financial advice. The Internet, for all its wondrous

Many cases have been reported where the addiction to online social networks
such as Facebook, Twitter and online games have affected the studies and
day-to-day work especially of students. Moreover, the convenience of the
Internet has allowed people to become less active.
As people are able to shop online, and with the amount of time they

among family members due to excessive use of the Internet.
Among the negative effects, cyber bullying is another aspect which

of their identities and their possessions through the Internet. Theft
is easily committed by experienced computer hackers. Therefore the
