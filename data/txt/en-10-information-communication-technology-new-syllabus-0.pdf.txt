Information and Communication
Technology
In this chapter you will learn:
² how to identify data and information
² what a system is
² the systems we come across in our day to day activities
² characteristics of quality information
² Information and Communication Technology
² applications of Information and Communication Technology
² evolution of the computer
1.1 Data and Information
The numbers, words, images and symbols which do not bear a meaning,
when standing alone are called data.While we can arrive at meaningful information
by arranging and processing data, we can use them to make decisions also.
Example 1
It will be difficult to get an idea about the subjects and marks if names and
marks are written separatly on term test results.
Ravi 78, 90, 79, 67, 76, 98 Rizwan 87, 70, 80, 75, 80, 80 Krishan 76, 78, 67, 80, 79, 76
But these names and marks can be tabulated as follows:

In this table, name and subjects such as language, maths are data and total,
average and rank are information.
You can see that the teacher is able to get the required information using
this table (i.e. the total score of each student, their average scores, individual skill
of each student, the rank etc). The information gathered in this manner is useful for
the teacher to take important decisions.
Example 2
To identify the difference between data and information, let us consider the
following Figures;
When we take each
separately,
image
it does not convey
a meaning. But
properly
when
arranged as on the
right hand
side,
one can understand
that these are the
members of one
family.

Analyzing NIC number
Take a look at the numbers in a National Identity Card. At once it looks as if it is just
a number. But when you analyze it, you can obtain some meaningful information.
When the NIC number is given one could find the person's age and gender.

Number 5-9 denotes that the person is a female
Activity
Provide five other examples for data and information.
1.2 Information System
Once, man used to process data using a pen, pencil or other devices. But
today the computer has become man’s data processor. A system is a combination of
components that work together to fulfil a task.
Submitting data for processing is called “Input” and the result we get after
processing is called “Output.” We can call the collection of all these components
above a “Information System.”
Storing data is an important task in information system. In some occasions,
both input and stored data are used to obtain information.
Hence the purpose of a system is to receive data, process and store them and
provide the results when required.
According to the figure 1.3 a computer processes the data that we input,
according to the commands and provide us with the required information in the
desired form. Therefore, we call the computer an ‘ Information System’.

We use many such systems in our day today activities. Let us consider some
of the examples:

This is an image you could see on the
items we buy at the market. This is called
Barcode. This barcode is scanned at the
cashier by a Barcode Reader. Observe how
the bar code is used in different occasions.
This image is seen at the back
page of some books you buy. This
is called ISBN Code.

Image 2
Meet the librarian and find out what information you can obtain by taking ISBN number as
the input.
A computer or computerized equipment is used to process the data and we
make decisions based on the information we get as output.
We understand that we can get information by processing data and this
information can be used to arrive at decisions. However, not all information is
suitable for making decisions. Information obtained should be of good quality.
There are many characteristics of quality information. A few of them are given
below:
Quality of information
a) Relevancy
Example
It is not needed to submit all the academic information
from Grade 1 onwards, when the requirement is to submit
only the highest educational qualification.
b) Completeness Taking information from only a small group of people in
order to arrive at the PCI (Per Capita Income) of a country
is not sufficient. Incomplete information could lead to
drawing wrong conclusions.
If a doctor gets wrong information about the patient’s
health, it could be harmful to the patient.
c) Accuracy
d) Timeliness The information must always be updated. Today’s weather
report may not be suitable to decide on tomorrow's
weather.
If an organization spends money more than the profits to
collect some information in order to increase profits, it
would be a business loss to the organization.
e) Cost Effectiveness

1.3 Information and Communication Technology
We learnt that we can get information by processing data and that
information can be used to make decisions and arrive at conclusions. When we
exchange the information among different people or among different systems, it is
called communication of information.
Man has been processing and exchanging information since ancient times.
But he had to face many difficulties and obstacles in data communication. But
today it has become an easy task with the advancement of technology.
Today, technology is used in various ways to convert data into information
and then to exchange them. This is called Information and Communication
Technology (ICT).
1.4 Applications of Information and Communication
Technology
Today, you could hardly come across any person or a place that does not
use information and communication technology in day to day activities. Some
examples are illustrated below:

1.4.1 e - Government
When a government communicates with its citizens, companies, Government
and Non-Government Organizations and with other Governments (of different
countries) using ICT, it is called e-Government.
There are numerous web sites such as official web portal of the government
of Sri Lanka, Government Information Center, ICTA (Information Communication
Technology Agency) etc for e-Government activities. The difficulties in
communicating with the Government and obtaining Government information have
been overcome by these.

1.4.2 Applications in the field of education
Years ago Today
Days are gone when we were stuck among piles of books in order to collect
the required information. Today you have the luxury to see and gain knowledge
about the entire world at your own convenience, due to all the advancements of
ICT.
There are many ways as to how ICT helps you in your education. Let us
look at some of them:

aid
In many countries it has become a common practice to use a Learning
Management System to manage school system and higher education system. We
need an internet connection to link with the LMS. A person has to register himself/
herself on the official website to access LMS of a school or any other educational
institution. According to the picture 1.14, teachers and students can get many
services from LMS.

There are plenty of areas where ICT is used in the health sector for our
well- being. Let us consider some of them.
1' Use of ICT in diagnosis
Today, there are numerous high tech machines which help us in the diagnosis
and treatment of diseases. Diseases can be diagnosed at the early stages and the
patients can be given treatment accordingly. Some examples of these machines are:
Example 1 - CAT - Computerized Axial Tomography Machine
Using this machine three dimensional (3D) images of different parts of the
body can be made. These images are helpful in the diagnosis of diseases.

A range of automatic machines are available today to ease the work of the
farmer who worked hard in the field. These machines not only ease the work of a
farmer but also enables him to produce high quality yields.
Below are some of the machines used for agriculture in developed as well
as developing countries.
Example 1 - Meteorological Devices
These devices are helpful in assessing
the weather, climatic changes, rainfall, wind
direction etc. Such data are useful in deciding
on the crop cultivation and harvesting times.

peace of mind to human beings who are spending a busy and restless life today.
These devices enable us to:
³ listen to music to overcome a monotonous life,
³ watch missed TV programmes or movies of own choice through the internet,
³ exchange information between friends and relatives who live abroad or whom
we have lost touch through social media,
³ watch high definition video using technology,
³ surf the internet. This helps children to do learning activities and play games
during the free time at home,

In day - to - day life, there are instances where you use computer systems
by knowing or unknowing. For example, a modern car consists of a lot of computer
systems. Moreover, a modern ticketing machine in a bus, washing machine,
indicating the distance that can be travelled by the existing fuel in a vehicle can be
cited as examples.
1.5 Demerits of ICT
Not only does ICT help us as enabler to perform our day today activities, it
has become a close companion also. However, if you associate this companion in
an undue manner it may bringforth undesirable effects to you as well to the entire
society. The following are some of them.
• Addiction – A student or any other person who immerses himself/herself in
the excessive use of computer or who plays games on internet without a limit,
may lose the track of education and/or end up with ailments such as sore eyes,
back pain, headache etc.
• Building unsuitable friendships through social media.
• When the computer is infected by virus due to improper use of internet, it may
not function properly or go out of order.
• Mental disorders may affect a person causing harm to himself/herself and to
society by visiting improper websites.
• Publishing of distorted photographs and videos of individuals affecting their
personal lives.

isolation
There is an opinion that ICT has negative impacts on human society due
to issues mentioned above. But we have understood that the systems made by ICT
make most of man's usual work easy. Therefore, it is our responsibility to use ICT
in a responsible manner.
1.6 Evolution of the Computer
By now you would have understood that computers assist us in converting
data into information. Even though at present, there are automated computer
systems, the computer too has undergone a similar evolution process as human
beings and has reached the advanced stage today.
The computer was born in the attempt to make an adding machine. In order
to add numbers, a device called Abacus was invented around 5000 years ago.
In due course many new inventions were made. The followings are few of them:
•
•
In 1642, Blaise Pascal invented a machine called
the Adding Machine. This was the world’s first
ever mathematical machine.
In 1674, Gottfried Wilhelm Von Leibnitz
improved the machine invented by Pascal. With
these improvements the machine was able to
perform multiplication and division too.
• A French Scientist named Joseph Jacquard
Figure 1.65 - The Abacus
invented a mechanical loom using Punch Card System.
• Charles Babbage started to make his Analytical Engine using the Punch Card
System concept. This machine was based on the concepts input, process, output
and store. Since this concept helped in the development of the computer, Charles
Babbage is called the father of computing.
• Madam Ada Augusta Lovelace is considered as the first programmer since she
•
tried to write programmes for the Analytical Engine.
In the year 1944, a man named Howard Aiken invented the machine called
Automatic Sequence Control Calculator at the Harvard University with the
assistance of his companions and IBM Company. This was named MARK 1.
All the versions of early computers were mechanical in nature. From the
time when the computers became automated they were categorized into various
‘Generations’ as below:

Find information on computer history and make a report as a group
activity.
Summary
Images, words, numbers or symbols which do not convey a meaning when
standing alone are called data.
Information is obtained by processing data. Information is used to make
decisions.
Computer is a system.
Computers and computer based systems are used to process data.
Providing data is called ‘input’ while extracting information is called ‘output’
Quality of information is important, (relevancy, completeness, accuracy,
timeliness, low cost)
Data input, processing and data output are components of a system.
Technology is used to exchange the processed data. This is called ICT.
Applications of ICT have made man's life easy. There are many applications
such as e-Government, education, health, agriculture, business,transport,
entertainment etc.
The advent of computing dates back to 5000 years. Computing is categorized
into many generations from the period of automation.

Fundamentals of a computer
system
After studying this chapter you will be able to understand;
² features of a computer,
² classification of computers,
² functions and devices of a computer system,
² basic components of a computer,
² computer ports and,
² computer network.
2.1 What is a computer?
First chapter described how computer systems can make day-to-day work
efficient.
A computer can be described as an electronic device, which accepts or
collects data, processes them according to the given instructions and produces the
desired output.
Computer has become an essential device in our lives. Some of these
features of a computer can be described as follows;
Speed
Accuracy
Efficiency
Versatility
Storing and
Retrieving
A computer takes only a few seconds to perform calculations.
It executes more than one million instructions per second.
A computer provides correct output when correct instructions
and data are given.
A computer never gets tired. It can work round the clock with
the same level of accuracy.
A computer can be used to perform many tasks simultaneously.
This is one of the special features of a computer.
A computer is used to store large number of data and information
in a relatively small unit and we can retrieve them easily and
quickly when needed.

2.2 Classification of computers
As described in the first chapter, a computer can be used to perform various
tasks such as preparation of documents, control machineries or check your illnesses.
Hence you may understand that a computer always may not take the same physical
form.
The computers that we use can be divided into different types. There are
various classifications of computers according to the size and the technology used.
Hence, computers can be classified as follows;

Figure 2.1 - Computer types
2.2.1 Classification according to physical size
(i) Super Computers
These computers have higher
computing power. Computing power
means the tasks that can be completed
within a specific time period. They
are large in size, expensive and rare.
(Figure 2.2) These are used for scientific
and engineering functions and to solve
complex mathematical problems. For
example,
these computers are used
in institutes like NAZA, large scale
businesses and for military purposes.
(ii) Mainframe Computers
Figure 2.2 - Super Computers
These have relatively less physical size, computing power and are less
expensive than the super computers. In mainframe computers, a number of users
get connected to one computer using a number of terminals sharing, saving and
retrieving data. (Figure 2.3 and 2.4) These are used in large scale businesses, in
e-business and with super computer transactions done using internet. This type of
computers are used even today in some large commercial institutions.

(iii) Mini Computers
These are lower in physical size, less powerful and less expensive than
Mainframe computers and are also called common purpose computers. These are
easy to use. A few users get connected to the central computer and through a few
terminals share data and information. These computers are used in medium scale
institutions such as banks. (Figure 2.5 and 2.6)

Primary Memory. Then those are sent to the CPU for processing. The processed
data stored in the Primary Memory as information is sent to the output device.
The data and information which are to be stored are sent to the Secondary Storage
Device. The stored information can be sent to an output device through Primary
Memory. Control Unit sends the control signals to all the devices attached to
the computer system. Computer memory contains data and instructions. When a
computer programme works, the relevant data and instructions are sent to CPU.

 Printers
There are two main types of printers. These are,
Printers
Impact Printers
Non Impact Printers
 Dot Matrix Printer
 Line Printer
 Laser Printer
 Bubble Printer/Ink Jet Printer
 Thermal Printer
1' Impact Printers
Impact printers are a primary level device in the printing technology. Impact
printer refers to a class of printers that have a head or needle which strike against
an ink ribbon to make a mark on the paper. Its function it is noisy. However, since
the ink ribbon used is not expensive, this is used in banks and shops for printing
receipts etc. The following are some of the impact printers.
Example 1 - Dot Matrix Printer
Letters are printed on the
paper as small dots here when
the printer’s head strikes on the
inked ribbon with needle like tips.
(Figure 2.31)
Figure 2.31 - Dot Matrix Printer
Example 2 - Line Printer
This is a fast printer which prints one
row at a time. This can print about 3000 lines per
minute. (Figure 2.32)

2' Non Impact Printers
Non impact printers does not operate by striking a head against a ribbon.
Hence, it is not noisy. The printouts are better quickly. Running cost of these printers
are more expensive than impact printers. The following are some of the non impact
printers.
Example 1 -- Laser Printers
In a laser printer, the toner (dried ink) in a cartridge is applied on the paper
to produce the printout. (Figure 2.33 and 2.34)
Both black and white, as well as colour laser printers are available. The
laser printer produces clear and quality printouts.
Figure 2.33 - Laser printer
Figure 2.34 - Cartridge
Example 2 -- Bubble/Ink Jet Printer
Liquid ink stored in tanks is kept in the cartridge
and ink is deposited on paper through small nozzles and
produce the print. (Figure 2.35)
Example 3 -- Thermal printers
Heat is used to print the document. It is
commonly used in businesses to print receipts in
devices such as like ATM, and in printing labels
(Figure 2.36).

2.4.3 Central Processing Unit - CPU
This is the main component of a computer system. It is also called the brain
of the computer as well as it functions according to the given commands. CPU
manages the operating system and application software. CPU consists of three main
components. The functions of those are as follows;
1. Arithmetic and Logical Unit (ALU) Perform all mathematical and logical

2.4.4 Computer Memory
Several computer memory or storage devices are used to store data and
information and the functions of each are different. Computer memory can be
classified as follows.
Computer Memory
Main Memory
Secondary Memory
Random Access Memory
(RAM)
Read Only Memory (ROM)
Figure 2.39 – Computer Networks
Random Access Memory (RAM) is often referred as Main Memory.
(») Primary Memory
The memory that can be directly accessed by the Central Processing Unit is
called primary memory/storage. There are three types of Primary Memory.
∗ Random Access Memory (RAM)
This memory temporarily stores data.
(Figure 2.40) The data stored in RAM will be
deleted when the computer is switched off.
Therefore this is also called volatile memory.
Data coming from input devices as well as data
sent to output devices are held in RAM. When
comparing to ROM, which is discussed after this,
RAM has both read-write facility.
∗ Read Only Memory (ROM)
The data in Read Only Memory is not erased
when the computer is switched off. Therefore it is a
Non-volatile Memory. The commands required for
booting up a computer are stored in ROM.
These commands are called BIOS (Basic
Input Output System). Computer Manufacturing
companies store these commands in a ROM with
a smaller capasity and is connected to the mother
boars (Figure 2.41).

∗ Cache Memory
Though this is smaller in capasity than other memory, it is faster. This is also
called CPU Memory. This acts as the mediator between CPU (Central Processing
Unit) and Primary Memory. The data frequently used by are stored here. (Figure
2.42)
The Central Processing Unit checks cache memory first to see whether
the required data is available for processing. However, if the required data is not
available then the data is fetched to cache memory from RAM for processing.

(»») Secondary Memory
Secondary Memory or the Secondary Storage is the device which stores
data and information permanently. This is also called External Storage. There are
internal storage devices as well as external portable secondary storage devices.
Secondary memory is called non-volatile memory since it does not erase when
electricity is not available. (Figure 2.43) These can be classified as follows.

1' Magnetic Media Devices
Data is stored here by using magnetic field.
Example 1 - Hard disk Drive
The Hard Disk Drive (HDD), which is commonly used to store data and
information, is located inside the computer. However, there are external hard disks
as well. Today there are hard disks with large capacity due to the development of
the technology. The user can read and write the data stored in HDD. Therefore,
this medium is called Read / Write Memory. The capacity of a hard disk ranges
from 250 GB to 4 TB. The maximum capasity will increase with technological
development.
Hard Disk is made of several components.
1. Platter – This is a metallic, aluminum
or ceramic disk and data can stored
on both sides using magnetic media.
There can be several platters in a hard
disk.
2. Spindle – Holds the platter and rotates
it.
3. Head – Reads the magnetic data in the
platter and writes on the platter. There
are two heads for a platter; one on top
and one on bottom.
4. Actuator arm – Moves the head.
Enables reading and writing data
anywhere in the platter.
5. Power connector – Connects the Hard
Disk to power which is needed for
its function.
6. IDE connector – Transmits data to the
platter

2.5 Data Communication
Transmitting data and information is called data communication. Data
transmission can be carried out between two or more computers or devices such
as printers.Data transmission needs a connection between a sender and a receiver.
Creating such a connection is called networking.
2.5.1 Basic components required for data communication
The following are the basic components that are needed for data communication.
Figure 2.56 - Video port

2.5.2 Data Transmission Modes
There are several modes of data transmission between sender and receiver.
1) Simplex Mode
Data is transmitted from the sender to the receiver only. Getting print outs,
watching television, and listening to radio can be given as examples
3) Full Duplex Mode
Data is transmitted to both sides at the same time is called Full duplex.
Telephone conversation is an example for full duplex mode communication.
Medium
Figure 2.61 - Full Duplex Mode communication
2.5.3 Data Transmission Media
This is another important feature when creating connections among systems.
There are two types of data transmission medium. Those are called Guided/Wired
and Unguided/Wireless. The following are some examples. (Figure 2.62)
Figure 2.59 - Simple mode communication
2) Half- duplex Mode
Here, data is transmitted to one direction at a time. This means after data is
transmitted from sender / source to the receiver, the receiver can transmit data back
to the sender / source. Browsing internet to get information and walkie-talkie used
by security forces can be given as examples.

^i& Guided / Wired
If the medium used for data transmission is a physical medium, it is called
guided or wired.
Example 1 - Twisted Pair
Pairs of twisted copper wire are used for data
transmission. There are two types.
1. Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)
The twisted copper wire pairs used for
telephone connections. These are very flexible and
low-priced. However, it is difficult to transmit data
for a long distance through UTP wires. It is suitable
for maximum of 100 meters.
2. Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)
STP is a better quality and secure data
transmission medium. However it is expensive.
(Figure 2.64)
Example 2 - Coaxial Cable
This consists of an electronic cable pair. The
outer cable which is like a braided copper net produces
electromagnetic field around the central cable. These
two cables are separated by a plastic shield. These
cables are expensive and used for TV antenna and
CCTV.
Example 3 - Fiber Optics cable
Fiber Optics cable consists of a pair of an
cables. There is a plastic jacket to separate the two
cables. Core is a glass tube and there is glass cladding
around it. (Figure 2.66). The data transmission is
carried out by while reflecting light. These are used
in modern telephone networks. The cable is relatively
more expensive. This is the fastest data transmission
media at present.

the port in the Switch / Hub.
Figure 2.74 - Switch / Hub
Differences between the switch and hub
• The main difference is the data transmission speed. Hub sends the transmitted
data to all computers but switch sends data to the relevant computer only. Here
hub may create an unnecessary network data congestion.
•
In data transmission, hub uses half duplex mode and the switch uses full duplex
mode.
(iii) Wireless Fidelity - Wi-Fi
Wi-Fi technology has become the most
popular media in computer networking. For
this purpose, Wi-Fi access points are used.
This allows the users to build a computer
network easily and internet connections for
mobile phones and laptop computers using
radio waves.

(v) Modem
In getting the internet with telephone wires,
the modem is used to connect the computers of a
computer network or a personal computer at home

to analog signals so that they can be transmitted
via telephone line and the analog signals coming
from the telephone line send to the computer from
the internet is translated to digital signals. This is
called MOdulation and DEModulation. Hence,
‘MODEM’ is a combination of these two words.
There are different types of MODEMs. Those are
internal, external and wireless modems. Todays

ii) Bus Topology
Here, all
the connections are
established through a main cable. (figure
2.87) This cable is called the backbone
because any issue with the network affects
all the computers in the network. This design
is easy in networking and fewer cables are
required. However, a limited number of
computers can be connected.
ii) Ring Topology
Here, computers are positioned in a
ring/bangle and connected through cables.
Data or information move in a circular
manner. The breakdown of one computer
or cable can lead to the breakdown of the
entire network.

For free distribution 63
iv) Tree Topology
Tree topology has characteristics of both
bus and star topologies. In this design several star
topologies are connected to a bus backbone cable.
(Figure 2.89) One of the advantages of this is the
ability to control each network individually.
Figure 2.89 - Tree Topology
v) Mesh Topology
All the computers in the network are
connected with each other. (Figure 2.90) Since
this is a complex connection pattern, it is costly
and difficult to control. However, a breakdown of
one computer does not affect the connections in
the network. Mesh networking can be found on
internet.
2.5.8 Benefits of Networkings
Data and information can be shared
between computers.

sharing data and information between
computers. Data and information in
a server, can be accessed by clients
connected to the server.

Ability to share resources
This saves space as well because the same
data is not stored in several computers
unnecessarily.

Ability to control central software
Software can be installed on a server
computer and shared by many users
through client computers.
Ability to connect at any where and at
any time
By connecting to internet, a user can
access his / her documents and data at
any where and any time (24×365).
Security
Only the authorized clients can access the
server computer. Data and information in
a network can be made secure.

2.5.9 Disadvantages of Networking
Possible security issues
One major disadvantage of networking
is the difficulty in securing data. Server
can be accessed through any computer
connected to the network. Hence it is
difficult to secure it from the hackers
(people who try to gain access to data
without permission).
In some topologies, breakdown of a
computer or a cable can affect the function
of the other computers of the network.
If one of the computes in the network gets
a virus attack, this can spread to other
computers as well.
Due to defects or breakdown of the server,
the other the clients can be affected.

3.1.1 Number System
When typing letters or words using the computer, these words or letters
are represented by the computer as numbers it can understand. While this group of
numbers that the computer can understand is called a 'Number System' the limited
number of numerals in the number system called digits. The value of these numbers
(numerals) depends on the position they occupy within the number.
While the concept of number system was present in the 'Abacus ' considered
as the first calculating machine of the world, it has progressed up to the computer of
today.
The number system used for the representation of data in the computer is as
follows;

3.1.2 Use of Binary Numbers in Computer Data Representation
Computer represents data in two signal states. There are two Voltage levels
for these two symbols. One is named as the high voltage level and the other is
named as low voltage level. ''0'' and ''1'' digits respectively represent these low and
high voltage levels in a circuit. Thus, ''1'' and ''0'' status are
equal to the “On” and “Off” states of an electronic circuit.
Any data in the world can be represented on the computer
using these two digits.
According to the Figure 3.3 given below, when data
stored in Secondary Storage is sent to the Main Memory and
when it is sent to the Central Processing Unit from there, that
data are converted to a binary code.

Figure 3.4 – Colour representation in computer
For instance, if you need to use dark purple for the background of a document,
that colour can be represented in the computer as “135, 31, 120” (Figure 3.4).
With these numbers, the colour combination for the above colour is represented in
decimal numbers. Binary numbers for 135, 31 and 120 are 1000001112, 111112,
and 11110002.
3.2 Decimal, Binary, Octal and Hexa-Decimal Number
Systems
3.2.1 Decimal Number System
Each number system is made of a Unit, Number and Base / Radix.
Unit
Unit is a single object. For instance, a mango, a Rupee, and a day can be
considered a unit.
Number
A number is a symbol which represents a unit or quantity.
Base / Radix
A number of symbols used in a number system is called the base/radix. The
base of any number system is indicated in decimal numbers.

From our childhood, we have learnt to perform calculations using decimal
Number System which consists of digits from 0 to 9.
Normally, the base value of decimal numbers are not mentioned, but for the
other numbers the base value has to be mentioned. The digits that are used in the
decimal number system are as follows;

Let us study how a number included in the decimal number system is formed.
Example
Let us consider how the number 25 is formed.
25 is formed with the addition of 20 and 5.
25 = 20 + 5
= ^2 « 10& ¬ ^5 « 1&
= ^2 « 101& ¬ ^5 « 100&
These positional values such as 100, 101, 102 are called Weighting Factors of
decimal number system. This number can be shown on a counting frame (abacus).

or instructions, the computer represents these data as 0 and 1. The number system
which consists of 0 and 1 is the binary number system.

3.2.4 Hexa-Decimal Number System
The computer uses binary numbers and it is difficult for human beings to
read them. Hence, the hexadecimal number system is used as it is easier for humans
to use. Normally, calculations are performed using the ten fingers of the hands. Just
imagine you have sixteen fingers on your hands. Then you can use sixteen numbers
to count. In the hexadecimal number system, ten digits are used from 0 to 9 and for
the other 6 digits, A, B, C, D, E and F symbols are used. Here, A, B, C, D, E and F
are used to represent 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. (Table 3.5)

When F the largest number of hexadecimal number system, is expressed
in binary form, it can be indicated with 4 Bits. Thus, instead of using a binary
number with 4 Bits, a single number in hexadecimal number system can be used.
For example, Hexadecimal numbers are used to represent memory addresses of the
computer.
You can see code “# 871F78” related to the dark purple colour shown in
Figure 3.4. Here the value of the colour is started with “#” symbol. The colour
value is indicated in the computer in hexa decimal numbers. Thus, the code for dark
purple in the above example is “# 871F78”. R,G,B values of this can be indicated
from 0 to 255 in decimal numbers. If “#’ or “&H” (ampersand) symbol is used in
front of the value of any value, it is a hexa decimal number. Given below in Table
3.7 are the hexa decimal values and RGB values of dark purple colour.

3.3 Most and Least Significant Positional Value of a
Number
There are two separate methods to find the most and least significant values
of decimal numbers and whole numbers. When a whole number is read from left
to right, the number in the right most end is the least significant positional value
and the number in the left most end which is not 0 is the most significant positional
value. (Figure 3.10)

Least Significant
Positional Value
Figure 3.10 - Most and Least Significant Positional Values
In decimal numbers, the value in the right extreme after the decimal point
which is not 0 becomes the least significant positional value and the number in
the left extreme of the decimal point which is not 0 becomes the most significant
positional value.
3.3.1 Most Significant Digit (MSD) and Least Significant Digit (LSD)

Only the Binary Number System is used to find the most significant bit
(MSB) and the least significant bit (LSB). There are two ways to find this using
decimal numbers and whole numbers.
In a whole number, read from left to right, the value in the right extreme
is the least significant bit and the value in the left extreme which is not 0 is the
most significant bit. In binary decimal numbers, the value in the right extreme of
the decimal point which is not 0 is the least significant bit and the value in the left
extreme of the decimal point which is not 0 is the most significant bit.

3.4 Converting Decimal Numbers to Binary, Octal and
Hexa-Decimal Numbers
3.4.1 Conversion of Decimal numbers to numbers of other bases
All the data we input to the computer is taken by it as digits of binary
number system; 0 and 1. Hence, the knowledge to convert a base ten number to
another base is important. Here in this chapter, conversion of a decimal number to
a binary number, octal number and a hexadecimal number is discussed.
3.4.2 Conversion of Decimal Numbers to Binary Numbers
When a decimal number is converted to a binary number, the decimal
number can be divided by two until the remainder is 0 and the remainder of the
division can be written on the right side. After that, write all the remainders from
the bottom to top to build the number.

3.5.4 Converting Binary Numbers to Octal Numbers
From the digits used in the octal number system; 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, the
largest digit is 7. We can indicate digit 7 as 1112 in binary form. Thus 7; the largest
digit in the octal number system, can be indicated in a binary form with 3 digits.
Likewise, all the digits in the octal number system can be indicated in the three digit
binary form. Given below in Table 3.11 are the binary forms of the digits used in
eight base (octal) number system.

As per the above table, three bits are used when indicating an octal number
in binary form. (8 = 23)
Let us consider how a binary number is converted to an octal number.
Example
Converting 10111012 to an octal number.
¾ First, divide the number into three bits from the right corner to the left corner.
If the last cluster in the left corner does not consist of 3 bits, add 0s to complete.
¾ Write each octal number separately for each cluster.
¾ Then write these clusters in octal digits.
¾ Write these digits in order from the left corner to the right corner.

3.5.5 Converting Binary Numbers to Hexadecimal Numbers
From the symbols used in the hexadecimal number system, the value
represented by “F” possesses the largest numerical value. This can be indicated
as a four-bit binary number; 11112. Thus, all the digits in the hexadecimal number
system can be indicated as four-bit binary numbers. Given below in Table 3.12 are
the binary numbers for the digits used i n the hexadecimal number system.

3.6 Data Storage Capacity
A certain space is needed to store data in the computer. Data storage
capacity is measured by units such as bits, bytes, kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes,
Terabytes and Petabytes. Let us understand how to arrange these different data
storage capacities in order from the small unit to the big unit and to define the
relationships between these as well.
3.6.1 Units to Measure Data Storage
Bit
This is the smallest unit used in the computer to store data. This word is
coined from the words
B inaryDig it
A bit is the two binary digits; 0 and 1.
1 byte is 8 bits.
Byte
Nibble
A nibble is half of a byte or 4 bits. This unit is not commonly used like bits
and bytes.
kilobyte
This consists of 1024 bytes. (1024 = 210) Kilobyte is written as KB or kbyte.
92
For free distribution
Megabyte
This consists of 1024 kilobytes (1024 = 210) or 1048576 bytes. Megabyte
is written as MB or mbyte.
Gigabyte
One Gigabyte is made of 1024 Megabytes. (1024 MB) Gigabyte is written
as GB or gbyte. It is wrong to write ‘Gb’ as it indicates gigabit.
Terabyte
One Terabyte is made of 1024 Gigabytes (1024 GB). This is written as TB.
Petabyte
One Petabyte is made of 1024 Terabytes (1024 TB).
In production of hard discs there are instances 1024 is considered as 1000.
Observation
Following are the relationships between units which measure
data storage capacity.

3.7 Coding Systems
Figure 3.15 – Data you enter to the computer and computer data representation
According to the above figure (Figure 3.15), when you enter a data to the
computer, it converts the data to different patterns made of 0 and 1. Thus, binary
codes are used when storing numeric, alphabetic, special character, images and
sounds in internal storage devices of computers.
In the beginning of the lesson, when you type ‘A’ on the keyboard, the
code you get for ‘A’ is the bits pattern 1000001 (the binary code of letter ‘A’).
The number of bits used is 7. Thus, a combination made of a bit pattern is used
to represent each data and the bits used for each code is different. Following are
different coding systems used.
1. BCD
2. ASCII
Binary Coded Decimal
American Standards Code for Information Interchange
3. EBCDIC
4. Unicode
Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code
3.7.1 BCD - Binary Coded Decimal
This coding system was used in the early stages of computing. In this system
one digit is represented by 4 bits. This is used only to represent decimal numbers.
Sixteen symbols (24 = 16) can be represented in this system. The table 3.15 shows
the BCD codes for the 10 digits from 0 to 9.

3.7.2 ASCII – American Standard Code for Information
Interchange
Initially ASCII coding system used 7-bit binary digit. 128 characters can be
represented using this coding system. ASCII is used to represent text. (Appendix -
Table 3.17)
ASCII system is designed and approved by ANSI (American National
Standard Institute).

3.7.3 EBCDIC – Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange
Code
We can write only 128 characters using ASCII system, but the EBCDIC
code system allows the use of 256 characters. Here, one symbol can be written with
a binary number which consists of 8 bits. Hence, 256 characters can be represented
using this system. This system was used in IBM main frame computers. The table
below shows that there are different EBCDIC codes for the 26 different capital
letters and 26 different EBCDIC codes for the 26 simple letters in this system.

3.7.4 Unicode System
Though 128 characters can be used in the ASCII system and 256
characters can be used in the EBCDIC system for data representation. For
example, these systems cannot be used for Sinhala, Japanese, Chinese and Tamil
languages as there are more than 256 characters. Hence Unicode system was
designed according to a standard to represent 65536 different symbols of 16 bits
(216 = 65536).
As per the figure given below (Figure 3.16), shows the Unicode system
can be used to represent Sinhala and Tamil letters, and special symbols and picture
symbols.

Picture and Graphic Data
Given below (Figure 3.17) is a close up or a highly enlarged image of
photograph. A photograph consists of pixels (dots) made of different colours in big
grid. Computer graphic data such as pictures, frames of a movie or frames of an
animation consist of various colours. The picture given below consists of a number
of different colours.

• Sound
As shown in the figure below (Figure 3.17) is the sound emitted from a
speaker is normally represented as analog waves. However, all data in computer
are digital data and those are made of bytes. Hence, sound which comes as a analog
data is converted to a digital data. Thus, a sound is also represented in a bits pattern
made of 0s and 1s in a computer.

4.1 Introduction
Communication happens in various ways among living beings in day to
day life. Drumming was used in the past, as a method of communication. Further,
a railway guard in a station blows a horn waving a green flag to signal that a train
is going to leave. A green light should be there for the train to start and if it is a red
light, the signal is to stop.
Usually, two keys are used to open a safe and both keys are needed to open
it. Before you start a journey in a car, all its doors should be closed properly. If at
least one door is not closed properly, a light will be on or there will be a sound for
the driver to signal it. When all the doors are closed, this signal will be stopped.
Further, you should wear seat belts if you are seated in the front seats of a car.
Otherwise there will be a signal to indicate this. Thus, as we use signals in our day
to day life to make decisions, the computer also uses signals.

4.2 Logic Gates
Circuits which enable building of certain logical conditions using binary
values and which enable making certain decisions, are called Logic Circuits. The
Computer is made of a large number of complex digital circuits. These electronic
circuits are designed as required connecting a large number of basic logical circuits
called logic gates.
Central Processing Unit is made up of a collection of a large number of
logic gates.
The following Figure 4.1 shows a circuit made up of basic. logic gates;
AND, OR, and NOT.
Figure 4.1 – Circuit with Basic Logic Gates
The function carried out by a logic gate is giving an output considering an
input or several inputs.
There are numerous of technical methods to produce logic gates and its
internal circuit consists of devices such as transistors, diodes and resistors.
According to the way that the circuits are used, logic gates can be classified,
into two types.
1' Basic Logic Gates
2' Combinational Logic Gates
For free distribution 109
4.3 Basic Logic Gates
There are three types of basic logic gates. Those are,
1. AND gate
2. OR gate
3. NOT gate
4.3.1 AND Gate
Let us consider the example given below to understand AND logic.
•
If the door of your computer lab is locked with a key and padlock, both door
key and padlock key are needed to open that door. If both keys are there, you
can open the door. If either door key or padlock key is used, you cannot open
the door. Further, if keys are not there, you cannot open the door.
• Let us consider the simple series electronic circuit given below to understand
AND operation.
Figure 4.2 – E lectronic circuit when i nput A a nd
B value is 0.
Figure 4.3 – Electronic circuit when input
A and B value is 1.

Here, the two switches A and B, bulb Q and two batteries are connected in series.
Let us consider the two switches as input and the bulb as output.
When both switches A and B are closed only, the bulb will be switched on. The
bulb will not be switched on when either switch A or B is closed. When both switches are
open, the bulb will not be switched on.
If Logic 1 indicates both switches are closed and the bulb is switched on (Figure
4.2) and if Logic 0 indicates when one switch is open and the bulb is switched off (Figure
4.3), the relationships between AND logic gate inputs and outputs are given below. (Table
4.1)

Here, Q=1 when both A and B input are
in “1” state only. When either inputs are in “0” state
Q = 0. This table is called the truth table for AND
logic gate.
Observation
If at least one input is in "0" state, the output of AND gate is "0".
Four states (22 = 4) are shown in the table as this gate consists of two inputs.
Logic of AND gate is “A” AND“B”. According to Boolean expressions, it
is represented as A.B
A

Q = A.B

This AND logic gate consists of a minimum of two inputs and there are
AND logic gates with more than two inputs.

The value of Q is equivalent to the output of AND logic gate with three inputs
A, B and C.
Hence, the Boolean expression for this circuit is,
Q = A.B.C
There are 8 states in the Truth Table related to the above circuit. As there are 3
inputs, there are 8 states in the Truth Table. (23 = 8)

4.3.2 OR Gate
Let us consider the following example to understand OR logic.
² A bus passenger who is in a two door bus can get down from the front or back
door.
² If there are several routes to reach your home, you can use any of these routes,
Let us consider the simple electronic circuit given below. (Figure 4.8 and 4.9)
Here A and B two switches and Q bulb are connected to two batteries in
parallel. Let us consider the two switches A and B as input and the bulb as output.
Figure 4.8 - Electronic circuit when one
logical state of the two inputs is 1
Figure 4.9 – Electronic circuit when the
logical state of the two inputs is 0.
The bulb of this circuit will be 'on' when either A or B switch or both A and
B switches are closed. This can be tabulated as follows. (Table 4.4)

When either of the switches A or B is "on", it is represented as state "1"
(Figure 4.7). The state when both switches are open or the bulb is switched off
(Figure 4.8) is indicated as logic “0”. This table is called the Truth Table for OR
logic gate. (Table 4.5)

Observation
At least one input should be 1 for the output of OR gate to be 1.
When both input of the above OR gate is 0, output will always be 0. Further,
when all inputs are 0 of an OR logic gate with more than 2 inputs, output will
always be 0.
In the above table (Table 4.5), when A=1 or B=1 or both A and B are in state
"1", Q=1. This table is called the Truth Table related to the OR logic gate.
In Boolean algebra, this operation is symbolically represented as “A + B”.
Note that this is not the addition operation you use in Mathematics to add numbers.
Further, it is not the plus mark to indicate a plus number. Hence, it represents “A
OR B”.
Given below in Figure 4.9 is the Boolean algebra expression related to the
OR gate and the circuit symbols.

2. Construct the Truth Table to obtain the above output.
4.3.3 NOT Gate
Let us learn about the complement symbol to understand the NOT gate. The
task of the NOT gate is to provide the complement as the output. Thus, complement
of “0” is “1” and the complement of “1” is “0”.
The NOT gate is the electronic circuit that provides the complement as the
output of the input. Let us consider the circuit given below. (Figure 4.12)

When the A switch is closed, the bulb is not switched on as no electricity
runs through. However, when the A switch is open, the bulb will be switched on.
When the input is A here, the complement of A is the output. In Figure 4.13 is the
Boolean algebra expression related to the NOT operation and its circuit symbols.

4.4 Combinational Logic Gates
The function of devices such as the computer, calculator, washing machine,
microwave oven, mobile phone, modern televisions, digital clock, air condition etc
is based on the function of logic gates. There are circuits which are designed with
various logic gates to get the required output. Such combinational logic circuit can
be designed using basic logic gates.
4.4.1 NOR Gate
The logic gate which indicates NOT OR (i.e. complement operation of the
OR operation) is called the NOR gate. The logic of the NOR gate is the combination
of OR and NOT to get the output from NOT after leading the output to NOT from
OR gate. This can be shown as follows. (Figure 4.14)

Q1=A+B
Q =

The truth table for this can be built based on basic truth tables. (Table 4.7)

Observation
When the both inputs of the NOR logic gate is 0, the output is always
"1". Further, in an NOR logic gate with more than 2 inputs, when all
those inputs are 0, output is always 1.
Thus, the NOR gate is equivalent to the OR and NOT gates connected
in series. Following is the Boolean expression for the NOR gate and the circuit
symbols.

4.6 Integrated Circuits
Integrated Circuits (ICs) are used to construct electronic circuits. A complex
electronic circuit consists of various circuits. For instance, a modern television
circuit and a mobile phone consist of many circuits. An integrated circuit is a type
of circuit designed for a certain function with devices such as transistors, resistors,
capacitors and diodes. Now there are methods to produce circuits in small sizes
so that one circuit can be packed in one. Circuits produced in this way are called
integrated circuits.
As per Figure 4.23, a micro processor is made of a large number of integrated
circuits which use logic gates.
In these integrated circuits, there are logic gates. For instance, Figure 4.22 is
a logic circuit which uses an AND gate. Thus, there are integrated circuits designed
with the logic gates.
Figure 4.22 – Logic integrated
circuit with AND Logic gate
Figure 4.23 – External appearance of an
Integrated Circuit.
In this integrated circuit (Figure 4.22), 1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 10, 12 and 13 pins are
inputs. 3, 6, 8 and 11 pins are outputs. Figure 4.24 is the external appearance of an

4.7 Practical Usage of Logic Gates
Example 1
Home Alarm System
The circuit given below is an alarm system which informs the house owner of
a theft at home. This is designed using OR gates. This circuit protects two windows,
the front and back door of the house. When any window or door is opened, an alarm
system will be on. The logic gates which is connected to windows and doors are
connected to sensors. Input is "1" when windows or doors are open; input is 0 when
windows or door are closed. As shown in Figure 4.27, when all the inputs are 0,
there will be no alarm.
124
For free distribution
This means all the window are closed at this moment. However, there will
be an alarm when one input value is 1 or several input values are 1 or all input
values are 1. This means when a thief opens one window or door or several of these,
there will be an alarm. For instance, Figure 4.28 shows the alarm which warns
the house owner when the first window is opened by somebody. The moments the
alarm is on like this are shown in Table 4.11.

Circuits designed to control street lights.
Following Figure 4.29 is a circuit designed using logic gates to control street
lights. This is designed using a dark / light sensor, timer and a manual switch.
There are several occasions when the lights are on. These are,
• When only the manuals switch is closed
• When the input of the timer is 1 and when the environment is dark
• When only the manuals Switch is closed
126
For free distribution
When the manual switch is closed, its input is 1. Hence, the light is on.
When the input of the timer is 1 and when the environment is dark
If the time is in the range of two pre-arranged ranges the input is 1 and
otherwise 0. This means, the input is 1 when time is from 6 pm and 6 am, and the
input is 0 when from 6 am to 6 pm. Further, the light sensor will be 1 when there
is light above pre arranged value and it will be 0 when it is dark. Here, the street
light will be on when the timer’s input is 1 and light sensor’s value is 0. When the
environment is gloomy with a rain cloud, the street light will not be on though the
light sensor’s value is 0 if the time is not between 6 am and 6 pm.

Operating Systems
By completing this lesson you will learn,
² the necessity of an operating system
² the function of an operating system
² user interfaces of operating systems
² services of an operating system
² types of operating systems
² advantages of operating systems
² utility Programmes of operating system
² drives, folder and files.
5.1 Introduction to Operating Systems
A Computer consists of hardware, firmware and software.
Any physical component of a computer system with a definite shape is
called a hardware. Examples of hardware include: mouse, keyboard, display unit,
hard disk, speaker, printer etc.
The booting instructions stored in the ROM (Read Only Memory) are called
firmware. The initial text information displayed on the screen are displayed by
firmware.
How the initial operations of a computer are performed
² When the user powers up the computer the CPU (Central Processing Unit)
activates the BIOS (Basic Input Output System).
² The first program activated is POST (Power On Self-Test). Using the CMOS
(Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) memory this checks all the
hardware and confirms that all are functioning properly.
² After that it reads the MBR (Master Boot Record) in boot drive in accordance
with the firmware ‘bootstrap loader’ which is provided by the computer
manufacturer.
² Then the computer loads in the Operating System in boot drive to the RAM
(Random Access Memory)
For free distribution 129
² Once this is performed the Operating System takes over the control of the
computer and displays a user interface to the user.
This whole process is called booting which means that an Operating System
is loaded into the RAM (main memory).
Software is a set of instructions given to the computer to perform some
activity using a computer. There are many types of software. They can be broadly
classified as follows:
Software
System Software
Application Software
a) Operating System
b) Utility Software
c) Language Translators

b. Utility Software – These are used to manage and analyze the software
in the computer. The utility software differ from the application software
in their complexity and operational activities. Utility software helps
in managing the resources of the computer. However, the application
software function in different to the utility software. There are many
utility software which dedicated to perform certain functions. Some of
them are mentioned below:
i. Anti -Virus Software – to protect the computer from
virus infections
ii. Disk Formatting – to prepare the storage device in
order to save the files and folders
c' Language Translators - A computer program (software) is made up
by using a set of instruction codes. These instructions are written in
high level languages which are very close to the human languages.
These high level languages are translated into machine language (i.e 0’s
and 1’s) which are understood by the computer by language translators.
assembler, compiler and interpreter are examples for language
translators.

5.1.2 Application Software
The application software which runs on the Operating System is used to carry
out computer based activities of the user such as creating documents, mathematical
functions, data entry and, computer games.
Ex: Word processing, spread sheets, database, computer games,
Web browsers
5.1.3 Importance of Operating System
The software which facilitate the interaction between human user and
hardware is the Operating System. The Operating System provides instructions for
installation and management of various application software. Not only that the
Operating System manages all the input, output and computer memory too, which
means that Operating System is the sole software which manages the whole
computer system.

1. Microsoft Windows Operating System
This Operating System which was introduced by Microsoft is proprietary
software which means users have to pay for software license. Nevertheless this
Operating System very popular around the world and is available in many different
editions such as:
Windows Xp, Windows vista, Windows 7, Windows 8
In addition to the above versions there is a Windows Mobile version which
is meant to be used in smart phones, tablets etc. There is a server edition called MS
Windows Server as well.
2. Apple Mac Operating System
The Mac Operating System which was developed by Apple Incorporation
is called Apple Macintosh. This Operating System is also a proprietary software
which requires payment for license. However, this Operating System can only be
installed on Apple computers which are manufactured by Apple Incorporation.
3. Ubuntu Operating System
Ubuntu has been developed based on Linux Operating System, This
Operating System is available free of charge. Hence it is called a Free and Open
Source Software. We can download Ubuntu free from the URL: http//www.ubuntu.

5.1.5 Types of Operating Systems
The main function of an Operating System is to provide an environment
suitable for executing the commands issued by the user. Based on the functionality
of the Operating System it can be classified as:
1. Single user operating system
2. Multi user operating system
3. Multi-tasking operating system
4. Real time operating system
1.
Single user Operating System
The Operating System which provides service to one person at a time is
called a Single User Operating System.
Example - MS Dos Operating System
2. Multi-User Operating System
The Operating System which allows multiple users to use a system is
simultaneously called a multi-user operating system. This type of Operating
System is commonly used in Mainframe or Server computer where several users
are connected to a computer system simultaneously.
Example - Linux, Windows server
3. Multi-tasking Operating System
The operating system which allows to run multiple process at the same time
is called a multi-tasking operating system. A single user can run multiple operations
(tasks) at the same time on this type of operating system.
Example - Windows 7, Windows 8, Ubuntu, Mac Operating System
4.
Real Time Operating System
These are the Operating Systems which gives the output in real time without
any observable delays. Real Time Operating Systems are mostly utilized in ATM
end points. Also these kind of Operating Systems are installed in scientific devices
and small gadgets. These Operating Systems are specifically designed for particular
devices.

5.1.6 Services of an Operating System
The Operating System is a software which manages the hardware and other
software in a computer system. It provides services to other software. There are two
main services performed by an operating system. They are:
1. Managing the hardware of a computer
2. Providing user interface
1) Managing the Hardware of a computer
Hardware of a computer are managed by using the following processes;
i. Process Management
ii. Memory Management
iii. Device Management
iv. File Management
v. Security Management
vi. Network Management
Figure 5.4 shows the inter connection between resource management within
computer.
Figure 5.4 - Resource Management
Let us now consider the above mentioned management tasks;
For free distribution 135
i. Process Management
A user can perform tasks using a computer. Consider the example of printing
a letter. Eventhough we see the printing of a letter as a single process, it is infact
performed by dividing the whole process into small tasks within the computer. We
call this small task as a process.
Figure 5.5 - Processes Management
We can call a running computer program or part of the program as a process.
All the activities in a computer run as either a single process or a multiple processes.
Resource management activities such as allocation of CPU time, allocation
of memory, and allocation of input output devices of each process are managed
under the resource management of Operating System.
Odering of the processes (according to a sequence) is also performed under
management. For example consider keying in some data using the keyboard while
a document is being printed. The processor has to prioritize which action has to be
performed first. For an observer it appears that both these actions are performed
once. Infact, they run as two different processes. Also observe the situation where
we make some changes to the document which is in print. Do these changes appear
in that document which is being printed? The answer is "No" because these changes
which was made after giving the print command do not appear in the printout. This
proves that the processes within the computer are performed in certain order.
136
For free distribution
ii. Memory Management
Memory (We specifically talk about RAM – Random Access Memory)
plays a major role during the functioning of the computer. The input data are
stored in the RAM before being transferred to the CPU and the processed data i.e.
information are also stored in the RAM before being sent to the Output devices.
Hence systematic management of the memory is vital for the proper functioning
of a computer. Memory management process makes sure that enough memory is
allocated for each process and it also makes sure that the memory is freed once a
particular process ends.
Figure 5.6 - Memory Management
The Operating System employs various techniques to memory management.
We must keep in mind that the Operating System utilizes both the Primary Memory
(RAM) and the Secondary Memory efficiently in order to manage the memory for
various processes.
Again consider the example where we type some changes to a word
document is being printed. Do changes we incorporate to the document are printed?
No, it does not. Once the command for print is sent the data are sent to the RAM.
Only those data which is in the RAM would be printed. Those changes we add after
the ‘print command’ are not printed.
Activity

iii. Device Management
There are several peripheral devices connected to a computer system. The
operating system is responsible for the management of those devices. Device
controllers are used to control the peripheral devices whereas device drivers are
used to control software components.
Figure 5.7 - Device Management
For example if you want your newly bought printer to work properly you
need to install the relevant device driver on the Operating System. If you do not
install the driver you may not be able to get the full features of the Printer (such as
printing on both sides of the paper, etc).
Today there are devices which work once they are connected (plug and
play). The relevant device drivers are installed automatically once the device is
connected to the computer for the first time. Therefore nowadays the process of
installation of the device driver has become easy.
Activity
Activity
When you connect a printer to a computer, the Operating System
installs the relevant device driver automatically. When it does not
install automatically we need to manually install it. Find out and write
down the steps on how a device driver is installed in your Operating
System.

iv. File Management
We can save data in files and we keep the files within the folders in order to
manage methodically. The Operating System to manage the files and folders.
Figure 5.8 - File Management
Some of the services performed by the Operating System in file management
are listed below:
• Making new files and saving them at suitable places
• Deleting the unnecessary files
• Arranging the folders in order and deleting the unnecessary folders
• Renaming the files and folders
• Changing the storage location of files and folders
• Creating backups of the files and folders as needed

find the properties of a file/folder and write down the properties.
2. Write down the names of the Operating System which uses the
following file types;

• ReiserFS
3. Explain the following two methods used for accessing the files using the
Figure 5.10:
• Sequential Access
• Random Access
Figure 5.10 - Sequential Access and Random Access
v. Security Management
There are many security threats to a computer. For instance, Malicious
Software (Malware) such as a virus could harm the smooth functioning of a
computer. There could be other threats such as deletion or destruction of data/
information by unauthorized access to the system.
Protecting the computer from these kind of attacks also managed by the
Operating System up to some extend. Various kinds of techniques are used by the
Operating System to perform function.

Activity
1. List out and explain each of the methods used by Operating System
to prevent and control unauthorized access.
2. As Operating System cannot control or mitigate all the threats
brought in by external malicious software. An Operating System gets
the support of external (third party) software for this purpose. List
out all the threats which are difficult to be controlled by Operating
System alone and write down the names of different software which
can be used against each of those threats.
vi. Network Management
Operating Systems support different types of network connectivities. They
support wired and wireless connectivity for hardware devices in the system such as
computers, printers, scanners that exist in the network.
The Operating System also helps in accessing one computer from a remote
computer. A computer network facilitates from simple text communication to a
multimedia data communication. Today data communication is utilized at a greater
scale in networks. This concept is well demonstrated by Cloud Computing.
Figure 5.11 - Computer Network Management
2. Providing user friendly interface
We need an interface to interact with the computer. An Operating System
provides a user interface to input commands and instructions in a user friendly
manner. Using this interface, we can perform tasks without using complex
instructions.
There are two types of user interfaces provided by the Operating Systems.
They are:
For free distribution 141
1. Command Line Interface-CLI
2. Graphical User Interface-GUI
The following section discusses in detail about each of the above interfaces.
1. Command Line Interface (CLI)
This kind of interface was used by all the Operating System systems of the
early days. This interface had a ‘prompt’ where the commands are keyed in using a
keyboard. In using command line interface, the correct syntax has to be used.

The utility programs in an Operating System
Several processes are performed by the Operating System for the functioning
of the computer. Many utility programs are available in the Operating System for
the functioning of the machine as well as to protect from security threats. In the past
we had to buy different utility programs and install whereas nowadays most of the
required utilities come with the Operating System.
For free distribution 143
There can be many types of utility programs in an Operating System:
• Backup Software - To copy files and take back up of hard drives
• Disk scanner - To check the errors in hard drive
• Disk defragmentation - Organizing the hard disk by rearranging clusters of small
spaces together and creating a larger free space. This increases the efficiency of
the hard disk.
• File/data compression - Compression of larger files into smaller files
• Task Manager - to display information regarding the processes and programmes
in a computer and the general status of the computer
• System diagnosis tools - to monitor errors in hardware and software of a
computer or network of computers and diagnosis of system errors.
• Anti-Virus Software - Protecting the computer by identifying and eliminating
malicious software
• Clipboard - temporary storage of data/files for cut/copy and paste operations
• Data synchronization software - to establish consistency among data from a
source to a target data storage and vice versa
• Disk partitioning software - can divide an individual drive into multiple logical
drives
• Screensavers - for blanking the screen or filling it with moving images or
patterns when the computer is not in use.
• System profilers - to provide detailed information about the software installed
and hardware attached to the computer.
• Network utilities - to analyze the computer's network connectivity, configure
network settings, check data transfer or log events.
In the following section details of some of the utilities in an operating
system are given:
• Disk Partitioning
• Disk Formatting
• Defragmentation
Disk Partitioning
What is a Partition?
By default there will be only one physical drive in a hard drive. But this
drive is normally divided into many logical partitions. This process of dividing an
individual drive into multiple logical drives is called disk partitioning.
Normally partitioning is performed at the time when a hard disk is configured
for the first time. Partitioning could also be performed when a new hard disk is to
be added or when an existing hard disk is replaced with a new hard disk.
144
For free distribution
We may need to change the existing partition. When an already partitioned
hard disk is partitioned again, all the data in that hard disk would be deleted.
Therefore, it is necessary to keep it a point to keep a backup copy of the existing
data before partitioning again.
The following image depicts how a hard disk would look before and after
partitioning.
Figure 5.14 - Hard Disk – before and after partitioning
Why do we need partitioning?
There could be many reasons for undertaking partitioning. Below are some
of the reasons for partitioning.
• When we need to save different items in different places. (Ex: Software in one
drive and all other data in another drive).
• When we need to have more than one Operating System in the same machine.
(Ex: When we need to install both Windows and Ubuntu Operating System)
• To meet the requirement of the Operating System (Ex: Sometimes it becomes
mandatory that a separate partition is allocated for the Operating System)
We can see each of the divided partition as separate drives. In Windows
environment, it is a customary to name the first drive as C: drive and go on. This
means that the First partition becomes the first drive and would be named as C:
drive and the second drive would be named as D: drive and so on.
Note: In windows environment, Multimedia drives (DVD, CD), flash drives etc.
which are connected to the computer would be identified as ‘Drives’ and they
would be named using an English letter after C (after partitioning the hard disk).
For free distribution 145
However, in Linux environment all the partitions, multimedia drives,
flash drives etc. would be identified as individual folders (in Linux they are
called Directories). Therefore it cannot be seen drives named C: D: etc in Linux
environment.
Disk Formatting
A hard disk cannot be used once partitioning is completed. We need to
format each of the drives individually.
Formatting is the process of preparing a data storage device such as a hard
disk drive, solid-state drive, floppy disk or USB flash drive for storing data. This is
done using a file format in the Operating System.
The USB Flash Drives come pre-formatted so that they can be put into use
directly.
We can format hard disk drive, solid-state drive, floppy disk or USB flash
drive whenever need arises. Every time we perform formatting the data in the drive
would be deleted. Therefore it is necessary to keep back up copies of the data before
formatting.
Once a hard disk is partitioned and formatted we can start saving data on it.
Usually a hard disk is partitioned and formatted before installing an
Operating System for the first time. After the first time the need for partitioning or
formatting could arise very rarely.
You can see in the image below how a hard disk would look like after
partitioning and formatting.

Defragmentation
The following shows the defragment in Windows. Sometimes a file (which
is larger in size) may not be stored as a single track in the hard disk. This process
where a single file is broken into different pieces and stored in different parts of the
disk is called fragmentation.
Figure 5.16 - How a file is stored in different places of a disk
The Operating System splits a file into several portions and saves them
in different places in the disk especially when a saved file becomes larger due to
multiple editing. Further, the empty spaces that are created in the disk due to the
deletion of files is used to save new files which causes fragmentation.
It takes longer time to read a file when a file is defragmented and saved in
different places in the disk. It affects the efficiency of the computer.
If you observe a slowness of the machine (there could be many reasons for
the slowness of the computer, whereas fragmentation could be a one reason) the
best action to take would be to start defragmentation.
Disk defragmentation is the process of rearranging the fragmented data on
a volume (such as a hard disk or a storage device) so it will work more efficiently.
Figure 5.17 - Before Defragmentation After Defragmentation
However Linux based Operating Systems use a different method to store
files. Linux Operating System makes sure that ample space is left between the
saved files so that they can be saved at the same location as a single intact file even
when the file expands due to editing. Therefore there is very little possibility for
fragmentation to happen. It is also because Linux based Operating Systems have
the ability even to relocate the file in a new place if the file exceeds its allocated
memory space. Therefore there is no need for ‘defragmentation utility’ in Linux
based Operating Systems.

5.2 Introduction to File Systems
Computer is a machine which allows for storage of large volumes of data
while facilitating the quick retrieval of those saved data when we need. The data we
save must be given a file name for the purpose of identification. There are many file
names used in the storage media which are relevant to a partuclar Operating System
and Application Software. But all these file names consist of two components,
namely file name and file extension. However the file extension are hidden to the
user by the Operating System by default.

Figure 5.20 - Viewing details of a file
Selecting a location to save a file
A location is used in the storage space to save a file. It is called a drive. The
previous section detailed that several drives can exist after partitioning.
Drives
By default a computer uses the hard drive to save. If the hard drive is not
partitioned then it would be labelled as C: drive. If the hard drive is partitioned then
the partitions could be named in order as [C:], [D:], [E:] etc.
If there are other storage media such as CD, DVD or Blue Ray Disk drives
in a computer then these drives are given different letter names. For example if the
hard disk is partitioned into four separate partitions then they would be labelled
[C:], [D:], [E:]and [F:] drives whereas a CD, DVD or Blue Ray Disk drive would
be named as [G:] drive.
150
For free distribution
In the same manner when a pen drive is connected to the computer the new
drive would be labelled as [K:] drive.
If you want to see the number of drives in a computer, observe the following
steps: Open the icon “Computer”. Now you can see, the externally connected drives
such as Blue Ray Disk drives and pen drives are shown as devices with removable
storage.
Figure 5.21 - - Viewing the drives
Even though we use the drives to store the files, in general they are not
directly stored to the drive. Usually we create a folder in a drive and then store the
file it in. We should give a name to the folder in order to identify the folders too.
Creating a Folder
1. Select the drive where the folder to be created.
2. Now select 'Folder' under 'New' in 'File Menu' or 'New folder' under
'Tools'.
3. Provide a suitable folder name
Managing files and folders
We have to perform many activities using the files and folders in a drive.
1. Copy and paste of files/folders
2. Select the file/folder to be copied
3. Select copy (Edit → Copy or Ctrl +C)

“Good idea, but it’s difficult to write in a similar size and a similar way. So we’ll
use the type writer in the library”, was another suggestion.
“We should find attractive types of letters and add pictures. A border will give
a good finish. A typewriter won’t provide such facilities, will it?” Everybody is
confused. You need to find a solution for this problem.
We often use different types of documents in our day-to-day activities and
preparing these documents in different styles is called word processing. In order
to avoid the shortcomings of preparation of pen or pencil in based documents,
typewrites were used in the early days. Even though such typed documents were
better than the hand written documents, manual typewriters do not allow functions
such as formatting, saving, printing in required sizes.
The computer is the best machine for such an activity. A word processing
Insert objects such as images
software can provide the following faclities;
² Creation and editing

² Saving and retrieving
² Print preview and printing
² Spell checking and grammar
² Find and replace

The user can create documents using internet as well if the computer does
not have a Word Processing software. For this the user can use cloud computing.
There are many advantages of using cloud computing such as;
² The user does not have to install a word processing software on the computer
² The user does not have to allocate space to install software in the hard disk
² To save the document, internet itself provides facilities for space.
² The user can open or edit the document from any computer which has internet
facility
Example - Google Docs, Windows 365
In addition, smart phones and tablet PC’s are used for Word Processing
today and word processing software is available for this purpose.
Eg: Documents To Go, Google Docs, Kingsoft Office, Polaris Office etc.
Now we will learn how to use a word processing software to prepare
documents.
This chapter explains two word processing software which are commonly
used today. Further, some topics and tools which are common to other software are
also discussed.

Step 3
Saving the file by another name
Once the user save the document by giving
a name, it is called ‘File’. The user can
save the file by another name in another
place. Then the user will get two files by
the existing name and the new name. Since
files are saved with a file extension, it is
easy t o fi nd t hos e a gain.

Step 4
Closing the document
For this...
It is wise to close the document till it is
used again. Unwanted, opened files will be
a disturbance for the computer.
Select ‘File → Close’
Step 5
Opening the document
The user may need to open a file saved in
the computer or in a different medium.
For this...
•
•
•
Select ‘File → Open’ (Ctrl+O)
Select the saved file in the ‘Look
in’ location in the open dialog
box.
Select the document from the
window
• Click ‘Open’ button.
Step 6
Saving a document using a password
Saving a file with password provides security. Hence other cannot
open the document. For this;

7.1 Introduction
Perhaps in our day-to-day life or at work we need to perform calculations.
We use various methods to perform such calculations. Depending on the nature
of calculations we use our fingers or mental calculations to perform simple
calculations while we use calculators or paper based systems to compute complex
calculations. In order to do calculations easily and accurately let us learn how
electronic spreadsheets can be used.
We usually use a square ruled book to perform systematic calculations.
Every page in this book consists of pages with rows and columns. Electronic
Spreadsheets which consist of multiples of rows and columns based on this model
of square ruled books.

Using Electronic Spreadsheets we can accurately and efficiently perform
the following activities:
• Simple and complex calculations
• Presentation of data in charts
• Show data in ascending and descending order
• Segregate only the required data
• Check the validity of data
• Protection of data using passwords
• Saving for future use

7.2.3 Entering Data
Before entering data in a worksheet, we need to select the required cell. We
can enter the data once it is selected. The contents of a cell would be either a label,
value or formula.
1. Label
A combination of letters, numbers, special symbols or the text entered using
a keyboard are called labels. By default the labels are left aligned.
Figure 7.10 below shows how labels are left aligned.
Note: The telephone numbers would not be displayed in the same way as shown
below. (The first letter ‘0’ is not displayed). You need to specify the range of cells
where the telephone numbers to be entered as ‘Text’. Formatting cells would be
discussed in a later lesson.

7.3.2 Formulas with cell addresses and operators
The main advantage of entering formulae using cell addresses and operators
is when the values of the cells concerned change, the results obtained by the
formulae also get updated accordingly.
Example 1
In order to calculate the perimeter and area of a rectangle, let us enter the length
and breadth of the rectangle in cells A2 and B2 respectively. The formulae to derive
the perimeter are entered in cells C2,C3,C4 and the formula to derive the area is
entered in cell D2. See Figure 7.13
Figure 7.13 - The perimeter and area of a rectangle
Activity
Create a worksheet in your spreadsheet application based on the image
7.13. Observe the changes in values obtained from the formulae in
column C and D when you enter different values in cells A2 and B2.
Important: In cell D2 if you write the formula D2=A2*B2 it would be taken as a
label and hence calculations do not happen. Therefore it is important to remember
that nothing should be written on the left side of the equal sign (‘=’). (See image
7.15).

7.4 Use of functions to do calculations
When there is a large quantity of data it becomes a difficult and complex
task to write formulae using only the cell addresses. In this kind of situation
functions are used. The spreadsheet applications contain different functions to meet
the requirements of different fields. Let us learn some of basic functions which are
commonly used. (See table 7.8)
Name
of function
Table 7.8
Syntax
Use
SUM
=SUM(Number1,Number2......)
Adds the values contained in a
range of cells.
AVERAGE
=AVERAGE(Number1,Number2.......) Finds out the average of the
=MAX(Number1,Number2.......)
values contained in a range of
cells.
Finds out the largest value
contained in a range of cells.
Finds out the smallest value
contained in a range of cells.
=COUNT(Number1,Number2.....) Counts the number of cells
=MIN(Number1,Number2......)
MAX
MIN
COUNT
within a range of cells.
For example, look at the methods 1 and 2 given below. In order to find out the
sum of the values of cells A1 to A10, method 1 uses cell addresses whereas method
2 uses a function. The same results are obtained from both methods. However,
when there is a large range of cells, the formula shown by method 2 is simple and
easy compared to both the methods.

be included.

7.6 Relative and absolute cell reference
7.6.1 Copying a formula
A class teacher to calculates the total and average of each student after the
examinations of a term. However, using an electronic spreadsheet would make this
task efficient. This is because one can copy the formulae once apply it to many
other instances. Hence let us look at the steps on how to copy formulae along rows
and columns.
7.6.2 Fill handle of a cell
The small black square in the bottom – right corner of the selected cell or
range is called a fill handle. See figure 7.32
Fill handle

Follow the steps below to copy formulae using the fill handle.
Select the cell which contains the formula.
1.
2. Click the small black square in the bottom-right corner of the selected cell.
3. Drag the fill handle up to the required cell.
7.6.4 Use of copy and paste commands for copying formulae
Follow the following steps to copy formulae using the copy – paste
commands which contains the formula.
(1) Select the cell.
(2) Copy the contents of the selected cell (Ctrl+C).
(3) Select the cell to which the formula is to be pasted.
(4) Paste the contents on the selected cell (Ctrl+V).
7.6.5 Relative and absolute cell reference
A cell address (reference) consists of a column letter and a row number. In a
formula such a cell address is always called as a relative reference. The dollar sign
($) when sign is placed before a row number absolute row is obtained, when ($)
mark is placed before a column name an absolute column is obtained, when ($) is
placed before column name and row uumber absolute column and row absolute can
be obtained.
Example
- Relative cell reference
H2
- Row absolute cell reference
H$2
$H2
- Column absolute cell reference
$H$2 - Row and column absolute cell reference
7.6.6 Relative cell reference
If the row number and the column letter of the adjacent cells change
accordingly when a formula is copied, such cell addresses are called relative cell
reference.
For free distribution 219
Example
When the formula A1+B1 entered in C1 is dragged down along column C and
dragged sideways along row 1, the cell references change accordingly as shown
in image 7.33 below. Hence the cell references A1 and B1 could be considered
relative cell reference.
Column letters change
Row numbers
change
Figure 7'33 - worksheet with reletive cell reference
7.6.7 Row absolute cell reference
If the row number of the cells remain unchanged when a formulae is dragged
sideways along a row, it is called row absolute cell reference.
Example
When the formula= A$1+ B$1 entered in C1, and is dragged down along column C
and dragged sideways along row 1, as shown 7.34 only the column letters change
relatively while the row numbers remain unchanged. Hence the cell reference A$1
and B$1 can be called row absolute cell reference.
Column letters change

Example 2
See worksheet 7.35 where the price of many pencils are derived when we know the
price of the pencil.
Figure 7:35 - Relative and absoute cell reference
=A2*B2 is the formula we need to enter in C2 to calculate the price of pencils along
the column C relative to the number of pencils. Note that we cannot calculate the
price of pencils by copying along column C. When the formula is being copied A2
should relatively change into A3,A4,A5 etc. But the cell B2 should always remain
constant within the formula. Hence the correct formula to be written in cell C2 is
= A2*B$2.
7.6.8 Column absolute cell reference
If the column letter of the cells remain unchanged when a formula is dragged
down along a column, it is called column absolute cell reference.
Example 1
When the formula = $A1+$B1 entered in C1 is dragged down along column C and
dragged sideways along row 1, as shown in figure 7.36 only the row numbers change
relatively while the column letters remain unchanged. Hence the cell reference $A1
and $B1 can be called column absolute cell reference.
Column letters remain

Example 2
= SUM ($B2:B2) is the formula to be entered along row 3 at the end each Over, to
calculate the total runs. This is shown in figure 7.37 below.

When the formula is copied along row 3 it would appear as shown in figure 7.38
below.
Figure 7.38 - Worsksheet with column absolute cell reference
including formulae
7.6.9 Row and column absolute cell reference
If the row numbers and column letters of the cells remain unchanged when
a formula is dragged sideways along a row, such cell addresses are known as row
and column absolute cell reference.
Example 1
When the formula =A$1+$B$1 in C1 is copied along column A and row 1, the cell
references do not change as shown in worksheet figure 7.39
Column letters remain unchanged
Figure 7.39 - Worsksheet with row and column absolute

Hence when a formula with row and column absolute cell reference is
copied along a row or column, the references within the cell remain unchanged.

calculated from D4 to 14 and prices of books as per the number of dozens are to be
calculated from C5 to C10. Let us write all the formulas so that the relevant prices
are displayed at once when we enter the unit price of a book in cell C1. We have
C1 has to remain unchanged when the formula is copied along row 4 and along C.
Hence we have to enter $C$1, within the relevant formula.

Amara :- Shyama, for this year’s ICT day, our teacher suggested that we make a
Presentation which portrays the history of our school and also how
ICT is used in our school.
Shyama :- Amara, then what do we do for it?
Amara :- I think we all must get together and make a good presentation. Then we
can show it at the auditorium during the event using the new multimedia
projector.
Shyama :- That’s a good idea. We can even take photographs and videos of the
school using the teacher’s digital camera and insert them too into the
presentation.
Amara :- Yes, Shyama. Not only that we can animate the school emblem, the flag
etc and make beautiful slides too.
Shyama :- Also we can give print outs of the presentation to the guests. Can we?
Amara :- Yes, Shyama.. Let’s go to the teacher right now and get his ideas on how

8.1 What is meant by ‘presentation?
People make presentation to share their views, opinions, ideas and
knowledge with a larger group of people. During this process they may use different
techniques, methods, gestures and tools to impart knowledge and to justify one’s
points to the audience.
The Slide Projector and Overhead Projector
(OHP) were common tools for presentation. The
mechanism of overhead projector (See image 8.1.1) is
different to that of a slide projector. The transparent
sheets used in a overhead projector have to be
pre-prepared. But notes can be written on the transparent
sheet using a pen even when the presentation is going
on. However the contents of the transparent sheet once
made cannot be erased and used again. Also it cannot
present a video or an audio. Since this was a simple
device the presenters widely used the OHP’s to do
effective presentations.
Figure 8'1'1 - OHP
(Over Head Projector)
A completely different process has to be
followed in order to make the slides required for a
slide projector. The images taken by a camera have
to be prepared in a lab and fixed on to the slides.
Here too, one cannot include audio or video in the
slides.
But with the advent of computer technology
video cameras and multimedia projectors have
become common tools of presentation today.
Figure 8'1'2 - Slide Projector
The advantages of the multimedia projector is that we can display the
presentations which are made quickly using a computer, and the ability to include
multimedia contents such as audio and video.
We can include multimedia contents such as
numbers, letters, pictures, graphics, images,
movies and videos, tables and graphs, voice and
sound in a presentation. Since this presentation
contains multiple types of contents, it is called a
multimedia electronic presentation.
The multimedia projector which was
bulky in the early days is becoming smaller in
size with many new features.

8.2 The characteristics of a good quality presentation
We need a good quality presentation in order convey the message clearlry
to the audience. We can improve the quality of a presentation by paying attention to
its contents. Hence, let us look at the features to which we need to pay attention to
improve the quality of a presentation.
∗ Number of lines
It is important to consider the number of lines, as same as font size. The
most appropriate number of lines per slide are 6-9. If more than that are added,
it may take more time to read or font size may become too small.
∗ Font-size
The distance between the screen and the audience is an important factor
to decide on the font size of the texts of a presentation. It is an accepted norm
to keep the font size at 32 points or more. It is easier for the audience to read the
contents of such font size.
Think of a presentation you had watched; how many of these points
were considered there? Pay attention to these features when you watch
presentations in the future.
∗ Correct use of grammar and language
It is a must that you double check the grammar, spellings and use of language
by reading the slides carefully.
∗ Inserting images, drawings, tables or graphs
It is not suitable to insert more than two images, drawings, tables or graphs
in each slide. It may become confusing if we insert too many images, drawings,
tables or graphs in one slide.

∗ Use of colours
The use of colours in a presentation is a very important factor. We can use
dark colours, bold letters or use of different fonts to emphasize certain points.
The use of dark red colour throughout the slide is a not a good practice since
it may be uncomfortable for the viewers’ eyes. But you can use red for some
words, numbers, points etc which need attention. It is important to pay attention
to the contrast of background and foreground colours also.
∗ Animation and videos
It is ideal to use one animation or video in each slide. If you use more than
one, the overlap of sounds may cause confusion to the viewer.
∗ Pay attention on target group
When using multimedia it is important to pay attention to meeting the
objectives of the target audience. We have to prepare the contents of a
presentation such that it does not divert the attention of the audience away from
the objectives. Otherwise, the viewer may lose the attention. For example if the
audience’s attention is attracted towards a particular animation included in the
slide, the whole objective of the presentation might be lost.

Green computing ...
Green computing is the study and practice of designing, manufacturing,
using, and disposing of computers, servers, and associated subsystems — such as
monitors, printers, storage devices, and networking and communications systems
— efficiently and effectively with minimal or no impact on the environment.
The environmental effects of computing should be addressed Green use, green
disposal, green design, and green manufacturing. Green computing can also
develop solutions that offer benefits by aligning all IT processes and practices
with the core principles of sustainability, which are to reduce, reuse, and
recycle; and finding innovative ways to use IT in business processes to deliver
sustainability benefits across the enterprise and beyond.
Modern IT systems rely upon a complicated mix of people, networks,
and hardware; as such, a green computing initiative must cover all of these areas
as well. A solution may also need to address end user satisfaction, management
restructuring, regulatory compliance, and return on investment. There are also
considerable fiscal motivations for companies to take control of their own power
consumption.

² special characteristics of a database
² using fields to create tables
² identifying key fields
² relational databases

9.1 Database Concept
Chapter one included a description on what data and information are. This
chapter covers saving data in an organized manner.
Higher the amount of data it becomes difficult to keep in our memory. On
such occasions writing these data is one method. That is called manual database.
The other method is to maintain the data on an electronic medium. This is called an
electronic database. Data can be retrieved efficiently when needed if it is saved on a
database in a systematic way. Hence, the database is needed to save a large amount
of data and to retrieve them very efficiently.

It would be easy for you to remember names of your friends, but it would be difficult
to retain all their phone numbers in your memory. You can get these details easily
when needed if you write names and phone numbers in a book (Figure 9.1) or save
them in a mobile phone (Figure 9.2). Thus, the phone book can be considered a
simple database.

²
Required information can be found very quickly as data is properly
organized in tables in a database.
Easy to obtain copies.
Electronic databases can be copied very easily.
Smaller physical space to store data.
Though more physical space is needed to maintain a manual
database, a small space is sufficient to save data on an electronic medium.
Data analysis can be carried out efficiently.
Only the necessary data can be selected and processed.
Data can be shared.
The same database can be used in different application software.
Independence of data.
Though database and
software are connected, database
tables can be updated without changes to the application software.
Therefore, data and software are independent.

9.1.2 Features of a Database
• Minimal data redundancy
If the same data is stored in several tables, this is called data redundancy.
For instance, the name of a student may be recorded separately in the
admission card and the library membership card. When a name is changed, that
name should be edited separately in all documents. Given below is an example
where the name ‘Firosa Lai’ is changed as ‘Firosa Rafeeq’.

² Data consistency : By minimizing data redundancy, the same data being saved
in various tables can be reduced or prevented. This enables to maintenance of
data consistency.
If you consider the example above, student data, data about books and
usage of books are saved separately in different tables. As such data such as
name of a student or a book should be recorded only once. Thus, data consistency
is maintained.
² Increases efficiency : Since database tables are properly organized, saving
and reading data can be carried out efficiently. Hence, efficiency is higher.
As per example above, let us consider the change of name from Firosa
Lai to Firosa Rafeeq. If the same data (Firosa Lai) are recorded in different
tables, more time is spent to find all these places. This leads to inefficiency.
However, in related databases data consistency increases speed. Hence,
efficiency is increased.
² Increases accuracy : Since data redundancy can be minimized in a database, data
consistency is maintained. This increases accuracy.
Let us consider the example above where Firosa Lai is changed to Firosa
Rafeeq. If several places are corrected, one mistake would lead to inaccurate
information.
254
For free distribution
However, in the above database only one table is need to be updated to
change Firosa Lai to Firosa Rafeeq. This ensures data consistency. Therefore,
the accuracy of data is very high.
² Increases validity : Properties of fields can be assigned when a database
is planned. Validity can be checked at the data entry stage. This increases the
validity of the database.
For instance, field attributes can be imposed as fees to be indicated in
two decimals with minimum fees being 1000 which is mandatory.

² Security : Unauthorized access can be controlled by using a password
and encypting the database. This increases security.
Data encrypting is translating data in such a way that unauthorized personnel
cannot read it. In the following figure 9.4, data available in Employee table are
encripted so as it cannot be understood by an unauthorized person.

Student record book is a very important document for every student. Biodata of a
student and the marks obtained for each subject with the rank in all three terms in
all grades are included.

Five details related to each student are given above. Thus, data such as
Kavindu Prabashwara, Meenadevi Ramanathan, Mohommad Malikkar represent
one field. To name such a field, a ‘field name’ is used.
Let us create a table recording details under each field name. (Table 9.6)

A column of the table represents one field. Thus, the above table consists of
five fields. They are admission number, Name, Data or Birth, Gender and Telephone
number.
A collection of fields makes a record. Hence, the above table has three records.

There is the possibility of entering the same data again in the columns
such as Name, Date of Birth, Gender and Tel No. However, a datum entered in the
column of Admission No will not be repeated. Hence, the field Admission No is
more suitable to uniquely identify a record.
What are the books borrowed by Firosa Rafeeq? Let us learn how this is
found in relevent tables.

Composite Key
Both the year and sport are needed to uniquely identify
a record.
For free distribution 261
Since the column data of this table containes duplicate. There is no single
column to uniquely identify records. There should be a definite captain and a vice
captain for a sport in a year. Hence, as far as the combination of two columns;
year and sport is considered, identity of records exists. Hence, combination of both
fields ‘year’ and ‘sport’ can be considered as the primary key. The composite key
made of the combination of these two columns is suitable for the primary key in this
table. When indicating the composite primary key, fields are separately underlined.
(Refer Table 9.10)
Year
Sport
Captain
Vice Captain
Table 9.10
The composite primary key of this table = Year + Sport
9.1.7 Foreign Key
If a field (or a combination of fields) of one table can be used to uniquely
identify rows of another table, this/these field/s is/are called the foreign key.This
key builds connection of two tables.

Special features of a foreign key
• Builds a connection between two tables.
• The related data of the primary key field exist in the other
table.
• Foreign key of one table is the primary key of the other table.

Disadvantages of data duplication
(i) Inability to select a primary key field to maintain identity of records.
(ii) Inability to analyse data properly.
Though the number of students who have scored above 60 marks is 5 as per
the above table, the actual number of students in the class is 3. Hence, a
proper data analysis cannot be done.
For free distribution 263
(iii) Reduced efficiency
When entering marks of several years in the above table, more time is spent
to enter the admission number, name and date of birth of the same student.
This reduces efficiency.
(iv) Possibility to get inaccurate data is high.
There can be errors in entering the same data repeatedly. Mohommad
Malikkar can be recorded as Mohommad Malakkar in another place. These
mismatches can lead to inaccurate data. Hence, accuracy becomes low.
(v) Difficult to input data.
To enter the marks of a student, his/her name and date of birth should be
entered repeatedly.
(vi) Possibility to make errors in deleting data.
As there are several records related to a student, there can be errors in
deleting data.
(vii) Difficult to update data.
As there are several records related to one student, attention should be paid to
each record in updating it.
These difficulties are created as all data are stored in one table. Hence, to
minimize such difficulties, a table can be divided into several tables.
Let us create two tables: Student Table and Marks Table, by removing the
fields which cause data duplication.
Let us create Student Table (Table 9.15) which consists of Admission Number,
Name and Date of Birth.
In the Student Table, there is the possibility of data in Name and Date of
Birth fields being duplicated. However, data does not duplicate under Admission
Number. Hence, Admission Number is more suitable to identify records uniquely.
Therefore, the primary key of the Student Table is the Admission Number.

There is only one datum in the Student Table related to Admission Number
of Marks Table.
Hence, the field of the Admission Number is the primary key of the Student
Table and foreign key of the Marks Table.
9.2 Creating a Simple Database Manually
Data type : a type of data related to one field is called a data type. Let us learn about
some commonly used data type.
² Numeric: used for calculations. Exists in several forms.
∗ Integer: plus or minus whole numeric figures.
E.g.: 12, -23
∗ Real: plus or minus numbers with decimal places.
E.g.: 8.125, -2.64, 4.00
²
text: composed of letters, numbers or special characters (Eg- %, *, -). Though
numbers are used, it is not used for calculations.
E.g.: National identity card number –889534731V
Telephone number –0112785123, 0112 - 985123
² Currency: used to indicate monetary values.
E.g.: $12.45, Rs.35.00
² Date / Time: indicates dates and time
E.g.: 12/23/2013, 7.35 a.m
² Boolean: there are only two Boolean (logical) values; True and False.
The size of a field can be changed according to the data type and number of
data input to that field.

Medium
Let us learn electronic databases with the purpose of converting a manual
database to an electronic medium.
Definition
A collection of objects which facilitates planning and maintenance of the
database to the user is called a Database Management System (DBMS). This
consists of several objects like tables, queries, forms and reports. (Refer Figure 9.7)

3. Creating the Primary Key for a Data Table
Data should not be duplicated to uniquely identify rows of a table. Identity
of records can be maintained by using a column or a combination of columns of a
table as a primary key field. Convert the field of ‘Accession Number’ in the above
figure 9.8 to the primary key field.

9.4 Creating a Relational Database
You have studied the Primary Key and Foreign Key of a table in unit 9.1.
Rather than keeping all the data in a single table, it is easier, more efficient and
productive to input, update and delete data if those are recorded separately in
different tables. Hence, let us study this section well to break a data table into
several simple tables and to build relationships between these.
When creating a relational databases, several type of relations can exist
among tables. They are known as one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many.
9.4.2 One-to-one Relationship
If only a row of a table is related to a row of another table, it is called a
one-to-one relationship.
Two tables exist as A and B. A row in table A is related to one row in Table
B and a row in Table B is related to one row in Table A.

A record of the Marks Table is related to only one record of the Student
Table. A record of the Student Table is related to only one record of the Marks Table
as well.
The primary key of the Student Table is the Admission Number and it is the
foreign key of the Marks Table. The Primary key of the Marks Table is the Index
Number. The relationship built between these two tables through the foreign key is
one-to-one. (Figure 9.11)

9.4.2 One-to-many Relationship
If each record of a table is related to several records of the other table, this
is called a one-to-many relationship.
If the tables are A and B, and if B is the related table, the following Table
9.22 shows one-to-many relationship.
For free distribution 271
Table 9.22 – Features of a one-to-many relationship
Table A
A record in Table A can be related to
several records in Table B.
There can be records which are not
related to records of Table B.
Data in the column which includes the
primary key cannot duplicate.
Having a record in Table B related to a
record in Table A is not mandatory.
Table B (Related table)
A record in Table B can be related to
only one record in Table A.
There cannot be records which are not
related to records of Table A.
Data in the column which includes the
foreign key can duplicate.
It is mandatory to have at least one row
in Table A which is related to Table B.

In this table, the fields 'Payment Date' and 'Fees' depend on the Field Receipt
Number. Further, data is unique in the Receipt Number Field. The reason for this is
that receipt numbers will not be same. Anyway, there can be incomplete records in
the table as receipts should be issued in the order of payment. (Indicated as R in the
table) Further, data duplication can also be seen here.
Hence, let us break this table into two tables: Table 9.24 –Student Table and
9.25 – Fees Table.
The Receipt Number is the primary key of the Fees Table. Admission
Number is the primary key of the Student Table and the Foreign Key of the Fees
Table.

If number of records is 0, this means fee is not paid.
If number of records is 1, this means fee is paid once only.
If number of records is 2, this means fee is paid twice.
If number of records is 3, this means fee is paid thrice.
Thus, there can be no or several rows in the Fees Table related to a
row of the Student Table. Hence, the relationship between these two tables is

If a record of a table is related to several records of another table and if a
record of that related table is related to several records of the other table, there is a
many-to-many relationship between those two tables.
Example
Students take part in sports (team) as an extra curricular activity. There are sports
such as cricket, volleyball and football. A student can do at least one of these sports.
Further, there should be a team for each sport.

Special Features in Related Tables
As soon as the values of a primary key field of the Student Table are updated
using 'Referential Integrity,' the foreign key field values of the related table are
automatically changed.
Further, when a record of the Student Table is deleted, the related records of
the related table are automatically deleted.
First, data should be entered to the student Table. After that, data can be
entered to the Marks Table.
After entering the marks to the Student Table, data can be entered to the
Marks Table through it.
For this, click on the + mark which is in front of the Admission Number of
the Student Table. Then data can be entered to Marks Table easily. (Refer Figure

As shown in Figure 9.28, marks scored by students in 2013 and 2014 are
shown. You can obtain marks scored by students in 2014 only (information shown
in Figure 9.28) by naming year 2014 as Criteria. (Refer Figure 9.29)
Figure 9.29 – Giving Criteria for query
Figure 9.30 – Information received after running query with
Criteria
Various calculations can be made using fields through query. Let us learn
how total marks scored by students are calculated.
Add a new column to the query as Total and build an expression indicating
the calculation needed. To get total marks of subject it should be typed as:
For free distribution 285
Total:[Marks]æ[Maths]¬[Marks]æ[Science]¬[Marks]æ[English]. This can be
typed (Refer Figure 9.31.) or can be performed by building the expression, right
click the Mouse button on the column which you expect to get the total and select
Build command. Then use the Dialogue Box you get. (Refer Figure 9.32)
Figure 9.31 – Enlarge 'Total' column in the query

9.8 Designing Reports to Present Information
Reports are used to obtain printed copies of important information received
from the data of related tables. Both tables and queries can be used to design reports.
Let us learn how a report is designed using the query given above in Figure 9.33.
Report Wizard can be used to design reports.
For Microsoft Office Access...
Create Tab → Report Wizard → Select the necessary table or query (Refer Figure 9.34) →
Select the fields needed for the report from the table or query → Design the report as you need

² If a field (or a combination of fields) of one table can be used to uniquely
identify rows in another table, these fields are called the foreign keys.
² A relationship is built up between two tables by using foreign key.
² Data redundancy means the same data is stored in several database tables.
² The type of data that is relevant to a field is known as data type.
² In a relational database a relationships such as one-to-one, one-to-many and
many-to-many can be exist.
² To enter and display data, forms can be used.
